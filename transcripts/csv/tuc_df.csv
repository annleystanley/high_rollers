"Brennan: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Dimension 20-- The Unsleeping City."
"Emily, Siobhan, and Ally: [clapping and cheering]"
"Brennan: My name is Brennan Lee Mulligan. I'll be running this game for our wonderful cast of players. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: [in unison] Hi, intrepid heroes."
Siobhan: Brennan loves this bit.
Brennan: I love this fucking bit. I can't lie. Reintroducing our old friends-- Mr. Zac Oyama.
Zac: Hello.
Brennan: Emily Axford.
Emily: Ya-Hi.
Brennan: Lou Wilson.
"Lou: [hammy] Uh, hey."
Brennan: Siobhan Thompson.
Siobhan: [more hammy] Bleh-- ?
Brennan: Brian Murphy.
Murph: [even more hammy] Hey.
Brennan: And Ally Beardsley.
Ally: [deadpan] Hey.
"Brennan: Wonderful. Well, I'm going to go ahead and start to bring us to this new land of myth and magic that might seem eerily familiar to some of our viewers at home. It is a snowy, blustery day. Cold, crisp, clear skies over the [thick New York accent] best fucking skyline of any city that has ever been or will ever be. It is New York City, baby. [regular voice] Snow flurries from the sky as the wind kicks up. We see gusts of freezing air blow past the Chrysler Building, down through streets of honking cabs--"
"Pedestrian: Hey, I'm walking here."
"Brennan: And just looking miserable looking pedestrians, who crowd into the tunnels of the subways pack. All of a sudden, their winter coats trapping them in boxes of body odor and heat stuffed together on their morning commute. Down through the tunnels, a blast of laundry mixed with hot garbage and the sweet smell of the hot nuts stands. [sirens]"
"We go through the hellish wasteland in Times Square, up, up following snow again, over the bridge-- Brooklyn Bridge-- right here, through neighborhoods where families tuck their little bundled infants through strollers and walk down little lanes of trees. Back through neighborhoods, where, again, little corner stores sell hot bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches to morning commuters."
"[New York accent] A bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, the best thing you ever fucking ate. It cost what? $2.50? $2.25? That's a deal."
"Brennan: [regular voice] We follow the wind and it's early to mid-December morning in New York City. A city where so many people dream of coming and making a life for themselves. And it's always felt a little bit like maybe, just around the corner, there's a little bit of magic. I'm going to go ahead and roll to see which of our PCs will go first. [rolls die] Hee hee!"
"We follow a little whisk of snow all the way down, up through Williamsburg where the hipsters still dwell, but mostly the rich people that have now come and displaced those hipsters. And we arrive in a little neighborhood called Greenpoint, which is still an area of bars and partying. There's, like, rooftop places that have now been shuttered up for the winter, or those few tenacious places that have those insane heating lamps up so people can still be on a rooftop bar in fucking mid-December."
"And we go very close to the water. There is a dingy little doctor’s office. This doctor's office might not be super accredited, and it might not even be billed or listed as necessarily a doctor's office. It's kind of in a corner of a warehouse, way down by the water. And the snow settles on a windowsill. And in a dingy, little, medical office, we see our friend Pete the Plug. Ally, could you go ahead and describe your character for the group?"
"Ally: Yeah, I'm Pete. Just let me know what you're trying to track down because I'm sure I can get it. I sell everything and I personally take even more. [laughs] There is not an errand I can't run after a fistful of mushrooms."
Brennan: What does Pete look like? What's Pete wearing?
"Ally: Pete looks almost exactly like Hunter S. Thompson, only young. It's like, I'm wearing a cowboy hat. I got on shades, the yellow shades because they're helping me with seasonal affective disorder right now. I am not doing well on the inside. I did go through a breakup. I did lose the one and she's thriving. [laughs sadly] But I'm gonna be OK. And it's cool that I found a doctor that is so cheap, I'm hoping."
"Brennan: Speaking of which, so Pete you are sitting on a little roll out paper on the thing. You've got the phone in your hand. This is your personal phone that actually has, like, smartphone apps. It's not your business phone."
Ally: Got it.
Brennan: And you're looking at your text history with Priya.
Ally: [whispers] Of course I am.
Brennan: It's not looking great. It's a big wall of you--
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan:-- with time stamps going back for a couple weeks.
"Ally: Yeah. I said ""And one more thing…"" a lot of times. I probably just should have started writing these things in a note and saving it to draft, but I didn't. And she just wrote back ""OK."""
"Brennan: Speaking of the doctor's office, the door opens up and Dr. Lugash Primijitzki walks in. Dr. Lugash is a very kind but intimidating looking guy. He is great, broad shouldered with these huge hairy arms that kind of goes down a little bit longer. Can you imagine? He looks like-- he's got like strangling hands. He has a bunch of tattoos of weird dragons wrapped around his arms. He's got Cyrillic lettering in them. You see he's got a white shirt with a black tie. No doctor's coat. He's got a big square jaw with a nose that got busted up in a bunch of boxing matches or something, salt and pepper hair kind of in a flop, but these extremely thick rimmed black glasses. So he looks, his eyes kind of are magnified a little bit in his head, which looks a little bit goofy."
"Dr. Lugash walks in. You've worked with Dr. Lugash for a while. Your supplier, Seven, recommended him to you. Dr. Lugash works with people who need medical help for cash and not on the books. You see that Dr. Lugash walks in with a little chart and goes:"
"Lugash: [strong eastern European accent] OK, Peter, how's it going?"
"Pete: Oh, it's good, man."
Lugash: Yeah? You feeling all right? Your test results do not indicate that this is true.
Pete: [mumbling] What do you mean?
"Lugash: Well, I'm looking here. I guess we'll start with the small stuff. Your vitamin levels are not great. What have you been eating recently?"
"Pete: I found out, if you microwave cheese on a plate you can peel it off and then it's like a crispy-- like a crispy cracker."
"Lugash: Oh, boy. OK. You know you should not be eating just cheese, especially microwave. You thought-- you can't get-- you could go down to the corner store and get the microwave toaster. At least the cheese will be more crisp."
"Pete: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe you're right. Yeah, I could probably eat a salad or something."
"Lugash: So, good news as well. It look like you're totally healed up from the top surgery, which is great. Congratulations."
Pete: Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Now I'm ready to fuck. [starts sobbing]
"Lugash: Oh, boy. OK, Pete. OK, Pete."
"Brennan: Yeah, you see that Lugash comes over and gingerly wraps his giant arms around you and pats you on the back of the head."
Lugash: Peter--
Ally: Peter is inconsolable. He's just weeping in his arms right now.
"Lugash: Hey, buddy. It's OK. Hey, it's hard. Tell Dr. Lugash what happened."
"Pete: Yeah, I know. It's fine. It's fine."
Lugash: It's clearly not fine.
Pete: Yeah. I'm just happy to be alive.
"Lugash: He pulls up a chair and sort of nods, knowingly and says--"
Ally: I'm reaching into my bag for a mushroom cap.
"Lugash: [sympathetically] Enemy gang find out where you live, now you have to move? Is that what's going on?"
"Pete: Oh, no, actually, um-- [takes a mushroom]"
Lugash: [quickly] What you just eat? What did you just eat in your mouth?
Pete: [muffled] A vegetable.
"Brennan: You see, he snags it, and then he says:"
"Lugash: This hallucinogenic. Peter, you are on antipsychotic medication."
"Pete: Yeah, I know. That's why it's totally safe to do this."
"Lugash: Peter, I don’t--"
Pete: I can take as much psilocybin as I want. I've got the remedy.
"Lugash: Peter, when is the last time you slept?"
"Pete: I haven't really been sleeping. Yeah, I have-- right before I'm about to fall asleep, if I think of something scary or sad, I just stay up and then all of a sudden, it's 5:40 AM, and it's like I might as well microwave some cheese and start my morning."
"Lugash: Peter, I'm going to just run through a checklist real quick here, if I can."
"Pete: Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Doc."
"Lugash: You have not slept in a couple days. It's affecting your health. Sleep is most necessary part of recuperation. [Pete takes another mushroom] Don't take another mushroom. One, honestly, even for a good time, one is fine."
Pete: [muffled] Yeah.
Lugash: You are actively doing recreational drugs. You have not slept in days. You are on antipsychotic medication. You are also taking hormone treatment-- you're taking male hormones.
Pete: Yeah.
"Lugash: So, this in the medical profession, we would say is a lot going on. Right?"
Pete: Mm-hmmm.
Lugash: I don't think that is good for you. You need to-- I can't believe I'm going to say this. You need to find a way to get in touch with yourself because you are trying to medicate for a situation which medicine maybe cannot treat.
Pete: I kind of get what you're saying. [takes another mushroom]
Lugash: Maybe a therapist-- that's a third one!
Brennan: You see Lugash slams a meaty hand into your back and one of them sort of pops out. He looks at you and goes:
"Lugash: Look, I'm going to go and try to get a stomach pump because you're going to straight up go insane if you process those mushrooms. I'm going to be right back."
Pete: All right. Thank you.
"Brennan: Lugash leaves the room. Make a perception check for me, if you'd be so kind."
"Ally: Good. 17, plus, what else is perception? Oh, no, no addition. So 17."
"Brennan: You look up and you're just being annoyed because there's a drip in here. I mean, it's like a dingy old building. [sound of water dripping] You look over in the corner and you see it. There is a radiator, which is dripping a drop of water up and it's hitting the ceiling."
Pete: Righteous.
[eerie music]
Brennan: You see that a puddle slowly starts to form on the ceiling of the water dripping out of the radiator. And in a reflection of that ceiling puddle. you see that there's a little New York Public Health poster on the wall. And the reflection of the healthy sporty guy in a park turns to look at you and says:
"Man in reflection: Hey, Pete."
"Brennan: The reflection in the ceiling goes,"
Man in reflection: How's it going? I'm real.
"Pete: It's going-- honestly, I feel like I can be really honest with you. I miss her, and I deleted her number out of my phone but then I found it in our early Instagram exchanges and I re-added it, and I've already texted her this morning."
Man in reflection: OK. Magic's real. Everything's about to change for you.
Pete: Do you think she read the text or do you think I should--
Brennan: The door opens and you see Lugash comes back in.
"Pete: [looking up to ceiling] Hey, where'd you go?"
"Lugash: OK, this is not great. Right? Peter, listen. Mostly what I do here is I pull bullets out of gangsters that have been shot. That's like my number one thing."
"Pete: In a way, I was kind of shot."
Lugash: Not really.
Pete: I shot my tits off.
[cast laughing]
Lugash: I will admit-- I will admit it was my first time doing top surgery.
"Pete: You did a great job. I don't think you left that much stuff in there that you shouldn't have. It's a little bit bumpy on this side, but I think it's kind of cool."
"Lugash: Well, I am very excited to do it. You might imagine, there's not a lot in my line of work. There is not a chance to prove I am LGBT ally, so it's nice to be able to do that."
Pete: Yeah.
Lugash: I am worried about you. You need to get rest.
"Pete: OK, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Lugash: You need to heal. Be careful out there today. Oh, remember, by the way, I would say go get rest because also it's going to be a crazy day for you, right? Because SantaCon is happening today, right?"
"Pete: Aw, fuck. Yeah, you're right and they're going to want a lot of cocaine."
Lugash: Are people still doing a lot of cocai--
Pete: Just the Santas. They're stuck in the 90s.
"Lugash: Oh, these are mostly people from Hoboken."
"Pete: Exactly, exactly."
Lugash: It's like 10 years in the past over on that side of the river.
Pete: Yeah.
"Lugash: What you going to do? All right. Well, listen. One of my clients has just gotten into a violent car accident, so I need to go make a house call. Be safe, Peter."
"Pete: Yeah. Thank you so much, Doctor. I'll see you."
Brennan: He nods.
Siobhan: What a great doctor.
"Brennan: Yes, you head out. As you can see, the yearly clusterfuck that is SantaCon, where a bunch of college kids dress up in Santa outfits and go on a crazy pub crawl and make New York virtually unlivable for a day has already begun. I imagine you just head back to your apartment at this point."
"Ally: Definitely, yeah. Back to bed."
"Brennan: Cool. You get back to your apartment. On the train-- what do you think Pete's doing on the train as he's going? It's an above ground train a little bit, getting away from there."
Ally: I'm just listening to music. Probably listening to an old Lil Wayne album.
"Brennan: Little text pops up on your work phone from Seven saying ""Price of the brick went up. LOL."""
Pete: Fuck.
"Ally: OK. Yeah. I say, ""Yeah. We'll take care of it."""
"Brennan: You arrive back at your apartment, a little bit deeper into Greenpoint. Go and make another perception check for me."
Ally: 11.
"Brennan: You walk up to the apartment. You live in a spare room that is functionally a converted walk-in closet. You walk into the apartment and see Marta, who is this very old 60s, 70s Polish woman-- she's got a little babushka around her head-- and her early 20s grandson Jagdash. He's got a chin strap beard, very thick eyebrows. He's got a windbreaker. He's a wannabe gangster guy. You walk into the apartment and you see that a bunch of your stuff is in boxes."
Pete: Shit.
Brennan: Marta turns around.
"Marta: [Polish accent] OK, so. I got-- I found proof."
Brennan: And you see she takes a weird little plastic bag that's empty.
Marta: I know what this is. You deal drugs out of apartment?
Pete: What? No. No. What are you talking about?
"Marta: You are a bad boy, Chicka. You do this?"
"Pete: No. No. That is from a pen. That's dry ink from a pen. They do that now, here."
"Marta: [unconvinced] Dry ink from pen? You are drug dealer, all right? You scurry around--"
Pete: [exclaiming] I work at the school!
Marta: What you do? You wear a cowboy hat.
Pete: I work at the school. [reaches into coat and takes another mushroom]
Marta: No. I see you with drug from your coat right there.
Pete: That was a snack!
Marta: You are a bad influence on Jagdash!
"Pete: What are you talking about? No. Jagdash? Jagdash, look, I work at the school, right, man?"
Brennan: You see Jagdash looks at you and goes:
Jagdash: [confused] I thought you were drug dealer.
Pete: No. No. Remember the point is how much of not a drug dealer I am.
Jagdash: But I'm supposed to buy drugs from you later for a party!
Pete: No.
Jagdash: We're going to club.
Pete: I don't-- are you hearing him say all this? She's not mad at you.
Marta: My sweet grandson Jagdash would never! [cradles his head] He would never do this.
Pete: Look. I don't sell drugs. I promise.
"Marta: I find out you're-- I find out from this that you are bad-- I know you are up to no good because you come in, you have the crazy hair, and you have the cowboy hat--"
Pete: This is just my hair.
"Marta: You crazy, boy."
Pete: No.
Marta: So now you're going to be out on the street.
Pete: No. No. Come on.
Marta: Your father is here.
Pete: What?
"Brennan: You haven't seen your father in six years or something like that, and you hear a set of footsteps walking off this-- walking up the stairs."
Pete: What?
"Brennan: The door opens and you see your dad, Mitch, standing in the doorway."
"Pete: What the fuck? Mitch, what are you doing here?"
Mitch: [gruff voice] You’re gonna call me Mitch? OK.
"Pete: Yeah, I am."
Brennan: Your dad has not seen you in so long.
Pete: Fuck.
Mitch: I had a hard time finding you.
"Brennan: He goes, picks up one of the boxes of your stuff, and starts to carry it down the stairs. And it has a special box of yours in it that you definitely need."
"Pete: OK. Hey, put that down. Put it-- come on. What is going on?"
Brennan: He just continues down.
Ally: I follow him.
"Brennan: He goes down the steps and he’s like,"
"Mitch: Well, eventually, we had to pay a private eye to track you down."
Pete: How did they find me? I don't-- what? No way.
"Mitch: What do you mean, no way?"
Pete: I'm too good. No one can find me. What are you talking about?
"Brennan: You see your dad turns around. He's not really making eye contact with you. It's super weird and fucked up. Turns around and says,"
"Mitch: We knew you had to be in New York. We knew you weren't-- you know, left upstate dropped out of school. We want you to come home. OK?"
Pete: No.
Mitch: What's so great about this place? I saw a bunch of bums driving on the way in. It's dirty as hell.
Pete: Yeah. Exactly! I can't go and live on a farm where there's-- I'm the only trans person anyone's ever met in their lives.
"Mitch: That's-- OK. [waves hands] I-- I don't want to talk about that, all right?"
Pete: You're doing the weird chicken dance that you do whenever--
Brennan: You see he looks at you. You start to feel something weird as emotions kick up and-- that feeling of going over a bump in a road really fast where your stomach starts to rise and you feel a little bit weightless is starting to happen to you a little bit.
Ally: Cool.
Brennan: You see that he looks at you and goes:
Mitch: It's not a fucking conversation.
Brennan: He goes to say your deadname. And he goes-- [sound of bubbles in water]-- and a bunch of bubbles come out of his mouth and he starts looking around. And just tons of bubbles are issuing out of him. And they go into his clothes and around him and start lifting him up into the air as he flails his arms. And your dad is surrounded by bubbles and sails off into the sky. [whirling wind]
"Ally: Fuck yeah. I grab my box, I go back inside and try to live there."
Murph: End of campaign.
"Brennan: You take a step in. As you take a step i, you're feeling fucking-- you've never had a high like this before. You bump into someone and you hear them say,"
"Stranger: [thick, gruff New York accent] Hey, watch it, asshole."
"Brennan: You turn around and a trash can with two little eyeballs on top flaps its lid and goes,"
"Trash can: What’s your fucking problem? I was standing right here by the doorway. What are you, some kind of piece of shit?"
Pete: OK. I need to take an upper.
Brennan: You see two of the other trash cans turn around and say:
"Second trash can: Oh, what, is this guy fucking bothering you, dude?"
First trash can: I don't know. You trying to start some fucking trouble?
Pete: No.
"Second trash can: If we weren't already outside, I'd ask you, you want to go outside?"
"Pete: No, man. You're just a trash can."
"First trash can: Oh, I'm just a trash can."
Pete: You're just a trash can--
"First trash can: And you're just a piece of shit. Kids like you move into the fucking neighborhood, you sell drugs, you make crime happen. You're a real piece of shit, buddy."
Ally: I run.
Brennan: You take off down the street. You've got your box in your hand. Go ahead and make a Dexterity check for me.
Ally: 8.
"Brennan: You go and you're running. And as you look down, you're running through a little melted area of snow. And you look down and see that everything else but you has a reflection in the puddle. [eerie music] And at that exact second, you fall into the puddle. [snaps] All of a sudden, you are standing on the other side of the puddle in a snow-covered New York where snow is issuing out of the storm drains in the street and flying up into a sky full of endless stars. This sky is more stars than it is darkness. It is night-time here. You see that a full moon turns around to you. And you see that there is a beautiful woman in the moon. Incredible eye shadow, full lips, turns and says:"
Moon: Holy shit! This is fucking crazy.
Pete: I'll say.
Moon: You want to take a look around?
"Brennan: [sparkling energy sounds] This enormous moonbeam collides with the ground at your feet, and you are raised up on it and see an endless dreamscape of New York City stretching around you. A unicorn rushes past you that is-- you see the unicorn is sparkling, but you can tell it has also put glitter on itself."
"Emily: Ooh, hell yes."
[cast laughing]
"Unicorn: [Southern Belle accent] Oh my god! What are you doing here? Sugar, are you new to this place? Something tells me you're real as hell."
Pete: Yeah.
"Unicorn: Wow, that is something else. I am loving this."
"Pete: OK. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. [slaps face]"
"Brennan: When you slap yourself, you fall through the moonbeam. And you see that as you're falling, this insane owl, pigeon, monkey, angel thing-- it looks like a huge eight foot tall monkey with a pair of wings on its back and an owl's face starts flying around you and says:"
Angel: [excitedly] He's back! He's back! He's back!
Brennan: And grabs your face and gives you a weird beaky kiss and says:
Angel: I'm so happy you're here!
"Pete: Ow, what?"
Brennan: You land on the ground and it's very-- like a weird bouncy cloud. You see that there is a little rat with a slice of pizza strapped to its back like a hiker. And you see he goes:
Pizza rat: [squeaky voice] Holy shit. You're here! That's incredible!
Pete: Thank you.
Pizza rat: For sure.
Pete: Where am I?
Pizza rat: I don't know. Where do you want to be?
"Pete: OK. OK, something else was in those shrooms, I think. I think--"
Brennan: What is Peter feeling right now?
Ally: Insa-- this is crazy. I think I'm just like-- where'd my dad float off to?
"Brennan: As soon as you think of your dad, you see a little thing of bubbles with him sailing off in this dream realm and suddenly, you [whooshing] drop through the cloud and are in inky blackness, and you hear whispers all around you."
Whispers: He's gone. We have him now. You'll never have to worry about him again. We can make things that are unreal real. And we can make things real unreal. Whatever you want. Do you want this power?
"Brennan: Your med bracelet starts to glow on your hand. And a little happy face appears on it, throbbing like a button you could press. [buzzing]"
Pete: Is this DMT?
Ally: I think about pressing it. [a pause] Fuck it.
Pete presses the button with a little “bloop”.
"Brennan: You hear a colossal rending and the entire darkness splits above you and the silvery stars and white clouds pour through, and you can feel things screaming with joy as they escape from whatever realm this is. You suddenly feel yourself being drawn into deeper darkness. You hear a voice. [draws a menacing breath in] A single point of golden light, bright gold burning with intensity. You start to feel your real body sweating and your heart rate picking up."
"Voice: [deep, demonic voice] Start spreading the news. I'm leaving today. I want to—"
"Brennan: [sound of fire burning] A rectangle of golden light in burning lines, superimposed against inky blackness forever beyond it, appears before you, and the burning singes your skin and your eyes."
Voice: I want to be a part of it.
Brennan: You suddenly feel yourself dropping again and a little gray child's face with inky black eyes appears in front of you as black tears go down its gray face.
"Ally: What the fuck are you doing to me, man?"
"Brennan: And says— [to Ally, defensive] You wanted to be a wild magic sorcerer!"
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: And looks at you and goes,"
Gray baby: [whisper] It’s happening. I'm so sorry. Heed the words of Lazarus before it's too late.
Brennan: Disappears. You are in an alleyway surrounded by SantaCon people.
Pete: Fuck. [Brennan snaps] I wish I had a girlfriend.
"Brennan: You see that one of the SantaCon people turns over to you and half of his face melts. And he just goes,"
"SantaCon Attendee: Ho, ho, ho!"
Brennan: And bites the side of your head.
"Pete: No, no, no, no!"
Brennan: Great! And we're gonna move on to our next PC! Wonderful.
Siobhan: Jesus Christ. What a way to start.
Ally: Wow!
Lou: Oh my god.
Emily: That was trippy!
Lou: There's a lot of tension being released right now.
Emily: I know.
Lou: My god.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: All right.
"Emily: Should we take five? Jesus, I need to splash myself with cold water."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah. We're going to roll another little dice here.
Lou: Gray-faced child?
"Brennan: A little bit of snow kicks up and goes across the harbor, past the Statue of Liberty, swirling through the giant cables of the Verrazano Bridge, [Staten Island accent] all the way to Staten Island [normal accent] where we see a nice little hair salon. First class luxury beauty salon. We see that there is a woman sitting in a chair. She's got a little smock over her. And there is a woman styling her hair right now. Emily, could you please describe your character to us?"
"Emily: OK. My name is Sofia Lee. I'm sorry. No. It is Sofia Bicicleta. [Staten Island accent] I was Sofia Lee for [sighs] five beautiful years, but then my husband Dale left me. So now I'm back to Sofia Bicicleta. Sofia Bikes, you might hear me be called. I suppose I can have a bit of a hot temper. Dale really balanced me out, but now that he's gone I'm on a little bit of a bender. But that's fine. I mean, I can keep up an active lifestyle. Similar to Pete, I haven't been sleeping because the bed I was sleeping in I once shared with my husband. So I just don't even really like being there right now. And basically, I'm in a tight leopard print skirt, a tight pink cami, and basically, I look like if Fran Drescher went on an Amy Winehouse bender. And I'm doing a pretty bad job because I'm pretty hungover."
Brennan: You see the woman in the chair is trying to make small talk with you. She says:
"Woman: [Staten Island accent] And honestly, I couldn't fucking believe it because the house is a disaster--"
Sofia: Really?
"Woman: Oh, it's awful. They painted it this shade of like, I don't know, lime green. It looks like it's fucking St. Patrick's Day."
"Sofia: I tell you, everyone on this island has too much money they don't even know what to do with."
Woman: That's what I'm trying to say. It doesn't take a lot of money to be classy. I don't understand.
"Sofia: I know, but everyone just gets bored. So they just-- they're like, ""Well, I can't buy a bigger house because then it'll be obvious I'm in the mob, so I guess I'll just paint my house a new shade of lime green."" [starts crying] I'm sorry."
"Woman: Oh, god. Sofie, no!"
"Sofia: No, no, no. It's fine. I really want to keep doing your hair. I gotta get it teased."
Woman: I honestly-- I honestly-- Sof-- I've been coming to you for my hair for three years now--
Sofia: Yeah.
"Woman: I'm not trying to-- you know, you've fully cut my bangs down to about a quarter of an inch. They're--"
Sofia: Did you not want baby bangs?
"Woman: Well, the thing is that they’re a bristle now. So it really looks like I'm some kind of-- I don't know."
Sofia: Yeah. I know. I know. And I'm gonna-- I'm gonna give you a discount. I am.
"Woman: [dissatisfied] OK. Discount, OK."
"Sofia: Tell you what, give me your little-- give me your little coupon and I'll--"
"Woman: Oh, my punch card?"
"Sofia: Yeah, give me your punch card and I'll punch out a couple extra."
"Woman: Honestly, you're a doll. And honestly, it's so fucked up what happens. And god forbid anything would’ve happened to me and Bobby, but--"
"Sofia: OK. I don't think you need to bring in you and Bobby just because me and Dale fell apart. And we wouldn't have fallen apart if Isabella Infierno didn't come over the bridge or wherever she came from. [whispers] God, a prick."
"Woman: OK, look, I understand-- look-- everyone knows she's a whore. All right?"
Sofia: OK. OK. I don't know that we should be putting down other women that much.
Woman: Oh--
"Sofia: She's a succubus is what she is. Witchcraft is the only thing that could have taken Dale away from me. Yes, we've had our fights. Usually my fault because he was just so even-tempered."
Woman: Sofie--
Sofia: All he wanted to do was just watch the deer in the backyard.
Woman: He just watched deer in the backyard?
[Emily laughs]
"Sofia: He loved it when-- we had a couple of animals that would come in and out of the backyard, and he just liked watching them."
"Woman: Sofie, look--"
Sofia: He was a very calming presence.
"Woman: I love you to death. Everybody in the neighborhood-- when you went and married Dale, he's not from around here."
   Sofia: I know he's not.
"Woman: People here marry people from here, all right?"
Sofia: I know. And I don't want someone from here.
"Woman: And nobody wants to say, I told you so. Nobody wants to say that. So, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna settle up with you for the day. We're gonna stop it here. I'm gonna go look at some hats."
"Sofia: No, I can fix the bangs. I can. I just-- a couple more snips and I think they'll be fixed."
Woman: OK. I'm looking at it now and it looks like-- like those old medieval monks. It looks like one just shifted forward about five inches to cut off the front part.
"Sofia: Right. OK, it's not my best work, but do you want a free mani?"
"Woman: God, and I understand what you're going through. If I let any more of this happen to myself, I'm accountable for it. Right? I've already spoken up and I need to interject."
Sofia: Do you want some premade Sangria? I've got some in the fridge.
"Brennan: She looks over. You see that a bunch of Barbicide supplies that need to be kept cold have been removed from this fridge to have a giant pitcher of Sangria. You see, she says:"
"   Woman: OK, it's 10:30 in the morning."
Sofia: I know. I exercise some restraint at 8:00 AM.
Woman: OK. Yeah. You know what? I'll have a little bit of Sangria.
Sofia: OK.
Brennan: The door jingles and your brother Mario walks in.
Sofia: [flatly] What do you want?
"Mario: [Staten Island accent] How's it going, Sof? Jesus! What the fuck's wrong with this lady's hair? What's the fucking problem? It looks like shit—"
"Sofia: Oh, Mario, like you know anything about women's fashion."
Mario: I happen to know a lot! Just 'cause my fashion line went down in flames doesn't mean I don't know about fashion.
Sofia: [yelling] No one wants alligator skin anymore!
"Mario: When you say hurtful stuff like that, that's how I know you're in an emotional spot. Alligator skin has been-- is-- all right, fashion is cyclical, you fucking stugots! All right?"
Sofia: OK. OK.
Mario: I'm gonna lose my temper.
Sofia: OK. OK. Everyone keep-- everyone keep it together.
Mario: Here's what I wanna say.
Sofia: Hm?
"Mario: Mom would like you to come by for dinner at some point, alright? This is the fucking olive branch."
"Sofia: I know, I know, I know. [sighs] Yes, I will. I will come by at some point. I don't know what my night is like tonight."
Mario: How 'bout this-- how 'bout this Sunday?
Sofia: Sunday.
Mario: All right?
"Sofia: Oh. If I show up, am I going to be guilted for not going to church because it's Sunday?"
"Mario: I mean, would it kill you to go to church? I don't understand, right? It's like you marry some guy who's not from the neighborhood, now you're not going to church, and you know."
Sofia: Don't bring him into this. You didn't know him.
"Mario: Look, I don't know him, but I know Isabella Infierno, all right? And--"
Sofia: Oh my god.
Mario: You know what?
   Sofia: You want me to start running my mouth about alligator skin again? Because I will.
"Mario: It is a USA Business. You can farm alligator leather in the states. It is ethical. And fuck, I don't have to fucking explain myself to you. We'll see you Sunday or not, all right! Jesus."
Brennan: You see he turns and leaves. You--
Sofia: Don't forget to pay the meter!
Brennan: You leave after your shift is done. You settle up. It's getting to be that time of year where Christmas music is starting to be played around.
Sofia: Oh my god. Dale. [presses a finger to the bridge of her nose]
Brennan: It's just that time of year again. You're feeling extremely hung over and sobriety is starting to wend its way back into the corners of your brain.
"Sofia: OK, well, I have two options because if I don't get a drink right now, I'm probably going to go buy more Christmas presents for Dale like he's going to come back, so I guess I'm gonna go to a bar."
Brennan: [laughs] You head up to a bar. Go ahead and roll a wisdom saving throw for me.
Emily: Saving? Oh. 21.
"Brennan: 21, cool. So you get the fuck out of here. You don't go to any of the places on Staten Island that would remind you of Dale. You don't go to any places here. You hop on the ferry. You head into the city."
Emily: Wind in my hair.
Brennan: You maybe pre-game on the ferry a little bit.
Emily: Corona.
Ally: One of those Coronitas!
Brennan: You arrive-- you arrive in the city. What kind of bar are you looking for here?
"Emily: Honestly, just like one with as many people as possible. Or one-- maybe one that a bunch of people are by themselves so I don't have to feel weird for being by myself."
"Brennan: Cool. So you find some dingy Irish bar somewhere in the city. Old wood table, you sit at it. You start having your drinks. Go ahead and make a Constitution saving throw for me."
Emily: 16.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You're holding your own. You're able to-- you're going a nice couple rounds. This bartender, Sean, is looking at you. He's a scruffy bartender guy, late 30s."
"Sean: [New York accent] Hey, how's it going, Miss? What can I get you?"
Sofia: Can I get a Stoli Raz with seltzer and a twist?
"Sean: Yeah, I can do that for you. No problem."
Brennan: He goes over--
Sofia: That's raspberry.
"Sean: Yeah. Oh, I assumed. Yeah."
Sofia: OK.
Sean: I assumed. Yeah.
"Brennan: You see he has-- this is-- this place is close enough to the ferry that it has every flavor of Stoli. You see there's the Stoli Raz, puts the twist in it, seltzer, puts it in front of you. He says:"
"Sean: Hey, I like that-- what is that? Angora? It's a nice little-- a nice little sweater you got there."
"Sofia: Oh, thank you. Yeah, it is angora. It is authentic. You guys got a Kindle behind the bar or something that I could read?"
Sean: You want to read an e-reader?
Sofia: I don't know. I just-- I just-- I just don't entirely know how to interact with people right now.
"Brennan: You see he nods. You see that there's a couple of guys at the end of the bar. They've got like striped shirts, very spiky frost-- or not some but one of them is frosted but with spiky hair-- through chains. You see that one of them looks over to you and says:"
"Man: Oh, you want to read something?"
"Sofia: I'm trying to figure out how that could be a pickup line because it sounds like the beginning of one. Yes, maybe."
Man: Why don't you read my dick? [whooping]
"Sofia: Oh. OK. 'Cause I had considered maybe it was gonna go in that direction, then I thought, ""No, he's better than that."" No, I'm not gonna read your dick!"
Brennan: You see the one who says--
Sofia: Because I don't read short stories! Thank you! Thank you!
The cast “ohhhs” in reaction to the burn.
Brennan: You see that everywhere in the bar--
Emily: I jump up on the bar.
"Brennan: Everyone in the bar goes nuts for that. You jump on the bar. Cool. You are the hero of the bar at that point. You stay there for a while-- you're there, honestly-- you're there for hours."
Zac: Don't read short stories?
Brennan: I don't read short stories.
Zac: Not at all?
"Brennan: After a while, it's like-- I would say, it's 10:30, 11 o’clock at night-- you've been here for a couple hours. And you're having a ball. That burn was so great. The bartender's been hooking you up with free drinks. Go ahead, you've been here-- I’ll say four hours. Go ahead and give me four Constitution saving throws."
Emily: OK. First two are 21 and a 12. The next two are 9 and a 12. I am getting drunker though.
"Brennan: You are getting drunker. Yeah, it's getting to that point. You see you're having a ball and a huge bachelorette party comes into the bar. They're all going:"
"Woman: Whoo, Tina! Yeah, Tina!"
Brennan: They go to the floor. You see one of them says:
Woman: The bride-to-be will have a slippery nipple shot!
Sofia: Oh my god. There's barely any alcohol in there!
"Brennan: You see Sean walks over to you, the bartender, and says:"
"Sean: Hey, it's all right. This is a lot of business coming in."
"Sofia: Yeah. No, you're totally right, Sean. I'm so sorry."
Sean: You OK?
"Sofia: Yeah, you know, it's just, sometimes you lose the person that balances you out and you're a bit unhinged."
Sean: Let's get you some whiskey. You want a shot of whiskey?
"Sofia: You got any of the stuff that tastes like Christmas, like cinnamon and fire?"
Brennan: He does that. Go ahead and give me a Constitution saving throw with disadvantage.
"Emily: I got-- fuck-- an 18 still, but I did get a nat 20."
"Brennan: Cool. That Christmas shot goes down real smooth, real easy. You have this Christmasy shot—"
Emily: It gives me a clear head.
Brennan: Yeah. And you see that the maid of honor clearly raises her glass and says:
"Maid of honor: Tina, you are beautiful, you are wonderful, your life is all laid out ahead of you, and you're building it in this moment. And honestly, there is not a better guy than Richard for you. We're so happy you found the one. It is smooth sailing from here on out. But there's one last night of choppy water!"
Sofia: [interrupting] I just want to say something!
Brennan: All the whole bachelorette party turns to look at you.
Sofia: Sorry. Can I borrow this old karaoke machine? Thanks.
Emily: I mic it up.
"Sofia: I just want to tell you, Tina, that marriage was the best thing that ever happened to me, and you have a lot to look forward to. And, you know, I hope he makes you a slippery nipple every night before you go to bed. I do. I really do. [singing] ♪ Start spreading the news. ♪"
Brennan: You see that they stop you. The bachelorette-- all of the bachelorette party comes over and is like:
"Bachelorette party: [awkwardly] OK, thank you."
Sofia: You're welcome. You’re welcome.
"Brennan: And you see-- your vision goes a little fuzzy for a second. Those three guys at the end of the bar you saw earlier-- you're getting a little punch drunk from the alcohol. I guess just drunk. And you look over and, you swear to God, these guys are like 10 feet tall. And their skin is this mottled green, almost weird vegetative or something. And they have these long noses covered in warts. And they're kind of all laughing and looking at each other. And you see that two of the bachelorette party are basically, are like:"
Woman: You wanna go outside for a cigarette?
"Second woman: Yeah, let's go outside."
"Brennan: And you see they walk outside. You see the three hulking people that, again, your vision is fucking up, turn to follow these women outside after the bar."
"Sofia: Oh, no, I don't think so. If these are choppy waters, consider me their lifesaver."
Emily: And I stomp out. And I'm going to follow them.
"Brennan: You follow them. You see the two women hook around into a little alleyway, near this dumpster. They're just smoking real quick. They're doing that thing where they're dressed very cute, but it's fucking freezing outside. So they're just shivering and smoking. And you catch the first line of one of these, again, what is Sofia thinking as she sees these hulking monstrous-- ?"
"Emily: I think she's just going through the thing where she's like, ""Oh my god. I have been drinking so much that sometimes I am just-- I feel like I'm seeing things. The other morning, I woke up in an alley, and I could swear that a giant rat man brought me an egg sandwich and a Gatorade to help me sober up. So, I'm definitely-- I'm definitely killing some brain cells. But you know what? You've got to kill some to kill the ones that have the memories of Dale on them. So, yeah. If this means that some men look like creepy 10 foot tall gray-skinned men from now on, that's fine with me as long as I can forget [breath in] Dale's aftershave.”"
"Brennan: So you see that one of these hulking, weird wart-covered giants looks over at one of these young women and goes:"
"Giant: [low, rumbly New York] Hey, look. Can I bum a cigarette from you? It seems like you've got a real party going on in there."
Brennan: And you see he puts a giant clawed hand on the small of her back.
"Sofia: OK. All right. That's not a part that we touch on women. Hi, it's me, Sofia Lee— Bicicleta. I was in there on the karaoke machine earlier. I'll also take a cigarette."
Emily: And I smush myself in between the guy.
"Brennan: You see that, as you smush yourself in there, you see that— [eerie music] —there is something around these giant troll people that's like these wisps of almost heat waves on a hot day, or some kind of wispy bit of their shadow peeling off them, little flickers. It almost is a very subtle fire or a smoke or something. And as you wedge in and touch one, you see that the haze around them actually disappears. And the three of them look and see that you're looking at their eyes, where their eyes actually are. And they all kind of look at each other and look back at you. And you see that the two women quickly stamp out their cigarettes and walk-- slide away from you-- and you see that the three tall-- for all intents and purposes-- trolls turn to you and say:"
"Troll: You got a fucking problem, lady?"
"Sofia: Yeah, I got a problem. What are you doing with those women?"
Troll: Well—
Sofia: 'Cause I do not consider you the type to walk around without a cigarette.
Brennan: You see they look around at each other and they say:
"Troll: Well, that's on us, I guess. That cigarette tax is no joke though."
Sofia: That's true.
Brennan: They look at you and say:
"Troll: Well, maybe we can bum one off of you. What do you think?"
Sofia: I actually don't smoke.
Brennan: You see that one of these guys rears back a clawed hand to take a swing at you.
Emily: All right. I trip him.
Brennan: Go ahead and—
"Emily: Wait, really?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead. Real quick. I'll make a-- just make a Dexterity check for me to see if you can beat them to the punch."
Emily: OK. I got a nat one.
Brennan: Nat one.
Siobhan: First real roll of the game.
Brennan: This guy fucking—
Lou: Jesus.
Brennan: This guy fucking clocks you in the head for-- I'm gonna use my little dice box.
Brennan holds a little box up to the camera. It has a subway map on it.
Brennan: Siobhan made dice boxes for everybody.
"Emily holds hers up as well; it is leopard print. Zac’s is bright red, Murph’s is black, and Siobhan’s is pink and purple with fun designs."
Ally: Yes! I'll show mine later.
Brennan: This guy clocks you for 12 points of damage. And I need you to make another Constitution saving throw for me.
Emily: 14.
Brennan: Cool. Cool. Go ahead and make your attacks on him.
"Emily: OK. First up, I'd like to tell him,"
"Sofia: That hurt, but probably not as much as my burn earlier."
"Emily: And then, go attack him."
Brennan: Go for it.
Emily: Does a 15 hit?
Brennan: 15 does hit.
"Emily: Ooh! All right. That's gonna be 10, and then I’m gonna take my stiletto off and thwack him for another 7."
"Brennan: Ooh, shit. Awesome."
Emily: And then I'm gonna spend a ki point to—
"Zac: Oh, shit. [grinning]"
Emily: —thwack him again.
Siobhan: Fuck him up.
Emily: Flurry of Blows for another 6.
"Brennan: 6, 7, and what else? Sorry?"
Lou: 10.
"Brennan: 6, 7, and 10. 17— [laughing in disbelief] 23 points of damage. This guy, bam, knocks you in the head. You come out— your nice hairdo is a little bit messed up. Tell me exactly what happens to this fucking troll."
Emily: All right. I would like to take off both my stilettos and just put 'em through his eyes.
"Brennan: You see you go, whap, into this guy's eyes. So he goes [screaming] and just runs down the street, bumping into shit. And the two trolls run after him."
"Other troll: Holy shit! Vin, are you OK?"
"Vin: Nah, I got fucking shoes in my eyes!"
Sofia: [crying a little] Leave that bachelorette alone! She's got a really happy life ahead of her!
"Brennan: Sofia, you are shoeless."
Emily: Again.
"Brennan: You are definitely concussed. You feel yourself drop and fall against the wall outside the bar and sort of slump down into a very soft, warm trash bag."
"Sofia: It's nice. Oh, it feels like someone threw out a pillow."
Brennan: And Sofia goes to sleep. On to our next PC.
Lou: Wow.
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: Let's see who goes next. A bit of snow whisks off of the trash as Sofia pulls that other garbage bag onto herself for warmth.
Sofia: [quietly] This feels good.
"Brennan: And we go all the way off across the East River into Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where we come down and there's a little four-story stone building, railroad apartments, classic New York apartment building."
"And we hear-- [sirens, horn honking, fire roaring]-- as a raging inferno melts the snow overhead. The third and fourth story of this building are engulfed in flames. We see out the window, looking through a set of bars-- there are bars to keep the window safe for kids being in that space-- there is a little 8-year-old girl with a little bit of soot and smoke on her face. She's clutching a little teddy bear in her hand, looking at the bar and yelling down. You see that there's paramedics and firefighters and cops down. They’re saying:"
"Man: Don't worry, little girl! We're gonna get you out of there! Stay close to the window! Keep your head down out of the smoke!"
"Girl: [crying, in a childlike voice] I'm scared! I'm scared!"
"Brennan: With an eruption of force, the door of the room-- boom!-- explodes into cinders. Zac, could you describe your character for us?"
"Zac: I'm Ricky Matsui. I'm a firefighter in New York, specifically in Brooklyn. I believe in just doing the right thing, and I always wanted to be a firefighter. So, I accomplished that goal, so I'm feeling really good about myself. I'm pretty much set for life, I guess, and I'm just here to help."
"Brennan: Ricky, you survey the area here. You see that there is a barred window. There's a little girl near these bars of the window. It's a nursery room in here. You see that two of your other firefighter pals have just busted down the door into a room where it looks like the girl's primary caretaker, who's her grandmother, she turns around to look at you and she goes:"
Girl: Are you a firefighter?
Ricky: I am.
Brennan: What's Ricky do?
"Zac: Ricky-- first, Ricky's like:"
Ricky: That's a really cool bear. What's his name?
Girl: His name's Theo.
Ricky: All right. Hold on to Theo real tight. And then I'm gonna pick you up and we're all just going to have a fun time getting out of here.
Brennan: You see an emanating warmth of-- to say that it's holy often conjures connotations of like a religion-- but a holy light made out of just civic responsibility and a love of safety emanates from Ricky Matsui. And you see that the girl wipes the tears from her eyes and says:
"Girl: OK. We're going to be all right, little guy."
"Brennan: She says it to her teddy bear and runs up and leaps into your arms. What does Ricky Matsui look like, by the way?"
"Zac: Ricky Matsui is-- he is 5'8"", but really strong. He just works out. He believes in, you know, you just keep your body right to keep your mind right. It's the cheapest therapy he can have, working out. He picks the girl up with just one arm and he's kind of like a Superman-ish, if he were Japanese. And he's just ready to get out of there."
Brennan: Fuck yeah. And roll.
Ally: Cheapest therapy. [laughs]
"Brennan: You rush out. As you're running, something sort of tingles in your mind, in the corner of your consciousness. And you can feel moments before it happened. Go ahead and make a Dexterity saving throw for me."
Zac: 12 plus-- 13.
"Brennan: 13. You see that a beam-- a burning beam falls down behind you. You feel it about the same time before it happens. You jump, tumble, somersault with the girl holding onto her in your arms. She's holding onto her bear. There is now a burning obstacle in the way between your friends, who are getting the grandmother, who will maybe not be able to make it out past this beam that is now obstructing the hallway."
"Zac: I make sure no one's watching, and then I Create Water on the burning beam."
Brennan: There is a little girl in your arms.
"Zac: Oh, yes. I say:"
Ricky: Look out the window real fast.
"Brennan: She looks out the window real fast. You channel the power within you. Your fireman's ax, the questing blade, at your side glows bright and a geyser blast of water erupts from your outstretched hand. Coats the beam, the water corrodes it, the fire beats into it, and it snaps in half and clears the hallway."
"Ricky: Hey, something happened. What was the window like?"
Girl: The window? It was normal. I think normal. Did you-- ?
Ricky: That's awesome.
"Brennan: You make it out of here. You can hear your firefighter brothers behind you. You make it down to the sidewalk and you emerge from the smoke and you see that there is an eruption of cheers as the grandma and the girl comes out in your arms. You see that there's a New York One van there and a New York One reporter comes up, who's in the middle of the broadcast, and she says:"
"Reporter: Sir, sir, you've just amazingly saved a young girl's life in this burning building. On behalf of the city, thank you so much. Is this the last people in the building right now?"
Brennan: And holds the--
Zac: The other people got out already?
"Brennan: The other people got out already, yeah."
"Ricky: Yeah. That's pretty much it. [looks into the camera] Everyone at home, if you're watching this, make sure that your sprinklers are up to date, that you have fire extinguishers, and you're always taking the precautions you need to keep your home safe. We got lucky this time. Make sure that you're just keeping up with that. Am I on TV right now?"
"Reporter: Oh, yeah. This is for New York One."
"Ricky: Awesome. What's up, mom? What's up, dad? Emiko, hey, what's going on? I just want to say, you know, holidays are a tough time for Christmas trees. You know, you want to make sure you're safe with that. God, I'm just not used to being on TV right now."
"Reporter: Oh, that's OK."
Ricky: Was that good?
Reporter: I think we got what we needed.
Ricky: Awesome.
"Reporter: Absolutely. Sorry, was that-- ?"
Ricky: Did you want me to keep talking?
Reporter: No. You're good. Thank you so much.
Ricky: I'm good? Awesome.
"Reporter: You're fully good. Again, the heroic job of--"
Zac: Just stand behind her. [nods sincerely]
Reporter: Heroic job from the-- you can--
Ricky: I can get out of here?
"Reporter: From the New York Fire Department, FDNY. Yep. [the reporter looks behind at Ricky] Heroic job. Obviously, the fire has been contained. So, I mean, we'll just move the shot over here. Move the shot over here."
Ricky: Follow you? Follow you?
"Reporter: No, you're good. You're fully good, sir. Thank you so much."
Ricky: What kind of camera is this?
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: You reunite with the little girl. The little girl looks up at you and you see she's holding her bear as you reunite her with her grandmother. The grandmother says,"
Grandmother: [elderly voice] Thank you so much. You saved our lives. You saved my little girl. You are a hero.
"Ricky: I mean. You know, I'm just doing--"
Grandmother: March! You're Mr. March from the fireman's calendar.
Ricky: Yes.
Grandmother: Wow!
"Ricky: I posed for our calendar. It's me. Do you want me to-- I'll sign it if you want, I guess."
Brennan: You see that she pulls it out and says:
"Grandmother: Yes, I made sure to grab it on the way out."
Brennan: You see there's a singed—
Ricky: You grabbed it?
Grandmother: I grabbed it. I made the firefighters go back into the kitchen.
"Ricky: OK. Well, just make sure to keep safe. [signing] Wow, I'm not as tan as I used to be. I gotta work on that."
Brennan: You see she closes it and says:
Grandmother: You're a real hunky number in here. Ooh!
"Ricky: Thank you, ma'am."
Grandmother: Five alarms. No kidding!
Zac: I just show her my abs.
Brennan: She cries a little bit.
Grandmother: You are really a hero.
"Ricky: Thank you, ma'am. Appreciate that."
"Brennan: The little girl looks a little bit confused. You feel a little ping in your phone, but the girl looks up at you with a little bit of confusion and she says,"
"Girl: I looked at the window, but Theo didn't. You made that big log stop burning, right?"
"Ricky: You know, sometimes, firefighters use all the tools on their belt and some of it is confusing to children."
Girl: You're a wizard.
Ricky: I'm not a wizard.
"Girl: Oh, it's OK."
"Ricky: Hey, can you keep a secret?"
Girl: I'll keep a-- only me and Theo will know.
"Ricky: OK. Yeah, I've kind of got some magic in me."
Girl: [excited] Aah!
"Brennan: Screams and runs around in a little circle. Your phone pings again and you see that it's another-- you look at your phone. See that it's a couple of texts from Esther, who is the head of the Clinton Hill Chantry. And she is texting and says,"
Esther: Need to meet up ASAP. SantaCon today. Couple of points to cover. Would love your help if available.
"Zac: I send her a selfie of me with the fire and I'm like,"
Ricky: Just finishing up here. On the way. How you doing? Never mind. I'll see you in a sec.
"Brennan: You get a couple little ellipses and then just the word,"
Esther: Good.
Brennan: Cool. How does Ricky get over to the chantry?
Zac: How far is that?
"Brennan: From here, it's not too far. The train lines aren't great going from—"
Zac: Just sprints.
"Brennan: Yeah. So Ricky just gets up, sprints down the street, and you get up onto the rooftops, and are just bounding over the rooftops of New York, this ax glinting in the sun."
Ricky: [victoriously] Yeah!
"Brennan: You arrive at the Clinton Hill Chantry, which is a lovely little brownstone and a very beautiful ivy-covered part of Brooklyn. And you see that the door has a gargoyle, one of those bronze knockers that has a gargoyle biting a little knocker ring on it. And you approach the door. What do you do when you get to the door?"
Zac: I address the gargoyle. I say:
"Ricky: How's it goin', Frank? [metallic creak]"
"Frank: [thick New York accent, sometimes squeaky] Ah, you know, it's been better. Say, I gotta tell you, man. It gets to this time of the year. The heat and the cold. The metal expands and contracts. I can feel myself busting my fat ass through the wood of the door. It's a fucking hassle, you know. How 'bout you, man? You lookin' good!"
Ricky: I'm trying to get on that metal level.
"Frank: Good luck. Yeah, that's great, man. How's your ma? She's good?"
"Ricky: She's good. My whole family's great, I mean, a lot of people got problems."
"Frank: Oh, for sure. Hey, believe me, I know. For me-- hey, you got to count your blessings, right? You can move around. I'm stuck in a door, so--"
Ricky: If you ever want me to bring you any kind of treats or any kind of sandwiches or anything--
"Frank: Actually, yeah. If you're not busy right now, they're doing-- you know, there's this place down that way, Gianella’s that do like a chicken parm, if you wanted to grab one, I wouldn't mind that."
"Ricky: I could bring it to you later. I kind of got to go in there, and I'm sorry about it. [knocks]"
"Frank: Yeah, you're busy. [choking noises]"
"Brennan: You knock. The door swings open. You walk in. [whimsical, cheerful music] This is one of those areas of New York where it's-- there's this sense of old distinguished parlors and rooms. It's very dusty, leather bound books everywhere-- little glass case with some strange swirled staff in it. And you see that there's still some painter's tape over the glass case that your questing blade shot out of when you rescued these wizards from a fire about eleven months ago."
"You see Esther walks out. Esther is a very cool young wizard in her 20s. She's got like an undercut and a little bit of her hair coming over to one side. She's got a bunch of jewelry and very wizard chic, where it's like bangles and jewels and rings that do stuff. But then also just her wearing a pair of jeans and some high boots. You see Esther turns to you and says,"
"Esther: Oh, Ricky, good you [checks watch] made it here in record time."
"Ricky: Well, you know if you go over the buildings, it's a lot quicker. I keep saying this, but awesome haircut. It's awesome."
Esther: Thank you.
Ricky: It's so cool.
"Esther: Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Just like to keep it new and exciting. So, I want to tell you a little bit about SantaCon and what's going to be happening today."
Ricky: Awesome.
"Esther: Have I-- 'Cause you came in here about eleven months ago, so you missed the last SantaCon."
Ricky: This is my first SantaCon since I saw all the magic stuff.
"Brennan: You see-- you see that she says,"
"Esther: All the magic stuff. Yeah, since you were inducted into the Unsleeping City by the questing blade and the magical world that exists behind the waking world, New York was revealed to you, this is your first SantaCon with us."
Ricky: Yeah.
"Esther: So, what do you know about SantaCon already?"
"Ricky: I guess it's just a bunch of drunk people trying to have some fun in the streets. It's kind of hard to do other stuff while that's happening. For firefighters, a lot of us are working that. So, it's maybe not my favorite thing, but I get that people enjoy that."
Esther: For sure.
"Ricky: As long as you're being safe, that's the way to go, I guess."
"Esther: So what SantaCon actually is-- [darker, more mysterious music plays]-- is a little bit more complex than that."
Ricky: Awesome.
"Esther: People perceive SantaCon to be a large, obnoxious pub crawl. You ever wondered how Santa Claus is able to get to all those homes in one night?"
"Ricky: Well, I just assumed it's magic, but yeah."
"Esther: Well, magic has to work in certain ways."
Ricky: Totally.
Esther: Magic can't just solve everything. That's how we have all these books. It's actually quite complex.
Ricky: Gotcha.
Esther: Magic is very hard to do.
Ricky: Interesting. I thought-- yeah. OK.
Esther: It just doesn't solve all your problems.
Ricky: OK.
"Esther: So, first of all, Santa Claus is real."
Ricky: Awesome.
"Esther: Yes. Second of all, in order to get to all those homes in one night, Santa can't be in all those places at once. That would take a level of magic that is honestly staggering to even consider. So, instead what happens is Santa Claus clones himself millions and millions of times, and each of those clones goes to the separate houses. Are you with me so far?"
Ricky: Yeah. I think I get it. What? He clones himself a million times?
"Esther: Millions of times. Clones himself millions of times. And those clones then go about and actually do that work for Santa Claus. However, the technology that Santa uses is extremely potent, but--"
"Ricky: Wait, is Santa a scientist?"
Esther: Hm?
Ricky: He's a scientist?
"Esther: Partially, yes."
Ricky: Wow.
Esther: But also an extremely powerful sorcerer.
"Ricky: Oh, OK."
"Esther: Effectively, if you clone yourself millions and millions of times, even with the best arcane equipment available and the best spellcasting, not every single clone is gonna turn out great."
"Ricky: I grew up with twins and one of them was worse than the other, so that makes sense."
Esther: I hear that. I hear that. I believe--
"Ricky: Just didn’t like sports, he seemed like a nice guy."
"Esther: It's a little bit dissimilar from that, I won't lie."
"Ricky: Oh, OK. Yeah."
"Esther: But effectively what happens is that a week or two before Christmas every year, Santa Claus comes to New York, and because of the Umbral Arcana--"
Ricky: Mm-hmmm.
Esther: Do you need a refresher on the Umbral Arcana?
Ricky: I do. Yeah.
Esther: [long sigh] OK.
Ricky: I'm sorry.
"Esther: It's OK. No, it's all right. [whimsical music plays againe] So, I run the Clinton Hill Chantry, which is a branch of the Gramercy Occult Society. You’re with me so far, right?"
Ricky: Yeah.
Esther: The Gramercy Occult Society manages the Umbral Engine--
Ricky: Yeah.
"Esther: Right? And that creates the Umbral Arcana, which is the spectral force that keeps New Yorkers from being aware that magical things are happening around them at all times."
Ricky: Keeps them safe from the idea of magical stuff.
Esther: Yes. Precisely. That's exactly right.
Ricky: I can figure it out that way. Yeah.
Esther: It keeps them safe. It's a safety thing.
Ricky: Yeah.
"Esther: So, because of that, Santa deposits his defective clones here in the city once a year. That is SantaCon."
Ricky: And what happens to them after they get here?
"Esther: They mostly wander around. They're pretty harmless. Most of them have a hard time moving or getting around because, again, they're defective clones. But basically, we just need to round them up and kind of either, depending on how some people feel, you can either hold on to them and they naturally die in a couple of weeks, or you can just incinerate them."
Ricky: [whispers] Wow.
"Esther: But-- basically, that's what happens."
Ricky: Is Santa good?
"Esther: He cares deeply for the children of the world and voluntarily clones himself millions of times. The ethics of it are alarming, I won't lie."
Ricky: It's above my pay grade a little bit to think about that.
"Esther: It's a little bit above your pay grade. So, if you just want to hit the bricks and keep a patrol this evening for any of that weird stuff happening. And just round up any clones that you find and deposit them to us. If they're causing danger, I would say maybe dispatch them right then and there."
"Ricky: Wow. OK. Yeah. It's the right thing to do, I guess."
Esther: It's the right thing to do. Great. And that selfie was good. That was a nice little thing.
"Ricky: Oh, cool. Thanks. I wasn't sure what you thought of it, but yeah, I can keep sending them to you, I guess."
"Esther: It's not really an invitation, but do what you need to do."
Ricky: Awesome.
"Brennan: Cool, what did Ricky do after that? [laughs]"
Zac: Ricky takes off to SantaCon.
Brennan: Cool. You're wandering around. It's getting a little bit later in the day. You're rooftop to rooftop moving around. Go ahead and make a perception check for me and an investigate check.
Zac: Perception's only a 7. [chuckles] 10 for Investigate.
"[tense, dark music]"
"Brennan: Cool. So you're investigating around. You follow a weird, minty smell on the air, and you arrive at this alleyway. You smell the mint growing stronger. As you look over the edge, you see an unconscious Pete the Plug. And you see that there are three horrifying mutant Santa Clauses moving towards Pete's body on the ground."
Zac: From the—
"Brennan: You're up above them. They're in the alleyway going,"
"Mutant Santa Claus: [twisted, raspy, lisping] Ho, ho, ho."
Zac: I just— I just stop and jump.
Ricky: [shouting] Hey! What are you guys doing?
Mutant Santa Clauses: Merry Christmas!
"Ricky: OK, guys. Hold on."
Zac: [mimes descending a rope] Start climbing down.
"Brennan: You safely descend. Pete, you come to. You got bitten on the head and you can only smell mint. And you can feel your bones becoming sweet in your body."
Pete: [horrified scream] Fuck!
"Brennan: Ricky, you fully descend into the alleyway. What do you say to these weird mutants looking, shambling around, surrounding you? What do you do? They look a little bit menacing to you."
Zac: I just— I step between them and Pete and say:
"Ricky: You guys gotta go stand over there, right now."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: [jokingly] Santas?
Brennan: Make an—
Zac: Stand over there.
Brennan: Make an Intimidate check for me real quick.
Zac: I got a 20.
Brennan: [incredulously] A 20? You see the one that you were speaking directly to explodes into peppermint and the other two go [mutilated scream] and just start running away.
"Ricky: Oh, no."
Zac: Are they running into the street?
Brennan: It looks like they're running into the street.
Zac: I look at Pete and I feel like I have to check on him first.
"Brennan: Cool. Go ahead and make, I guess, a Medicine check for me."
Zac: 22.
Brennan: 22? Rad. You-- there is a cult sickness spreading through Pete's body.
Zac: Do I know if it's a disease?
"Brennan: You know that it's a magical disease, something that only a magical healer would be able to handle."
Zac: OK. I couldn't use Lay on Hands for five points?
"Brennan: It's not hit point damage, which is something else."
"Pete: Fuck, man. Help."
"Ricky: Hey, sir? Listen to me. I'm a New York City firefighter, and I’m here to help."
Pete: I think that guy fucking bit me.
"Ricky: Yeah, it looks like you got a pretty nasty bite."
"Pete: I pull my gun, like I'm gonna go after the two Santas."
"Ricky: OK, sir? Hey, hey, sir? Sir?"
Pete: Fucker!
Lou: [laughing] What the fuck?
Ricky: I'm gonna ask you to put that gun down.
Pete: Huh?
Ricky: Sir. I'm gonna need you to put the gun down.
Pete: I got all the licenses for it.
Ally: I put it back in my bag.
"Ricky: That sounds great, but you're in sort of a state right now. I'm gonna get you some help."
Pete yells in pain.
"Ricky: OK, sir, I know a guy who can help us. He works at the hospital."
"Pete: How much is it? No, I can't go to the hospital, man."
Ricky: I'm sure-- you really need to go to the hospital.
"Pete: No, no, no."
Ricky: I can smell how sweet your body's turning and it's time to take care of that.
Pete: Ow! And yum.
Brennan: A full peppermint tooth pops one of your original teeth out [pop!] and a candy cane striped tooth is just in your mouth.
"Pete: Oh, my tooth! I just lost a tooth."
"Ricky: Honestly, that's awful. Let's go."
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: Pete is having a hard time walking. And Ricky, you get an arm underneath Pete. You guys take off. As you kick up, a little bit of snow wisps up into the air, over the river to Manhattan, and uptown, up over the park, over the Upper West Side, past Columbia University, all the way to Harlem. A beautiful, beautiful morning."
[peaceful music]
"It's getting a little late in the morning now, and after having worked the graveyard shift the previous night, in a lovely apartment, the sounds of the neighborhood coming to life all around him, Kingston Brown wakes up for another shift. Lou, could you describe Kingston Brown for us?"
"Lou: Of course. Hello. My name is Kingston Brown. I work at St. Owen's. I'm about 6'2"". I wear my grandfather's black trench coat, generally over either my nursing scrubs or a white t-shirt. I'm New York born and bred. I've been here since 1963, when I was born. I've almost never left. I love it here at the city. These are my people. This is my space. I take care of it. I am a steward of New York City. I will be here until I die."
"Brennan: Kingston, you wake up in your apartment. This place is your sanctum. What kind of stuff is around you in your apartment right now?"
"Lou: I mean, we got framed jerseys, of course, from my favorite hockey team, the New York Islanders. [cast laughs] Of course."
Ally: Naturally.
"Lou: I got framed jerseys. I've got a very nice sound system, mostly vinyl, but not hipster vinyl. Actual vinyl. It's comfort over style. It's not-- there's a lot of trinkets and heirlooms and things that my grandfather or that my parents had that they've given to me, or things that I've collected from friends or people who I've worked with, that adorn the walls."
"Brennan: Beautiful. You put on your coat, you look out and see a little bit of snow kick over the neighborhood, and you feel the rate of your heart begin to match the rhythm of the city around you. You head downstairs. You're up on the third floor. You go down to the second floor. Your mom in a little nightcap with a little nightgown, big thick spectacles-- clear frame spectacles-- pops out of the door with a plate of eggs and sausage."
"Kingston: Mom, I can't. I gotta go to work. I can't eat right now."
Victoria: [elderly voice] Why can't you have breakfast?
"Kingston: Mom, I'm a 55-year-old man. I can feed myself."
Victoria: So you don't want my breakfast?
"Kingston: I mean, of course I'm going to eat your breakfast. I'm just saying that you don't need to go through all the trouble to make it for me."
Victoria: It's not a trouble when you love somebody.
Kingston: All right.
Lou: I go inside. I take the plate inside.
"Brennan: Take the plate inside. Your mom is glowing with just love and pride, having successfully trapped you on the staircase. There is so much more food waiting inside."
"Kingston: OK, Ma! I thought it was just this plate."
Victoria: What? No!
Kingston: I thought it was just this plate.
"Victoria: OK. Well, there's a little more. What do you want me to say?"
"Kingston: Well, I can't eat all of this. I'm gonna eat what's on this plate, and then, I'm gonna go."
Victoria: OK. You can take some with you.
Kingston: I can't take some with me.
Victoria: You can take some.
Kingston: [shaking his head] I ain't gonna take some with me.
"Brennan: You see that she kisses you on the cheek, and you can feel her old little hand with this little ring on it slip a little Tupperware into the pocket of your coat."
"Kingston: [pulls it out] Ma, what is this?"
Victoria: I don't know!
Kingston: I'm not supporting this habit.
Victoria: What you do is your business. You have a Tupperware in your coat. That's free.
"Kingston: OK, we're not going to fight. We're not gonna fight right now because I have to go to work. I'm gonna take this food with me, but we're gonna have words later."
Victoria: I hope we do. [kisses]
"Brennan: And kisses you on the cheek. And you head downstairs. You see that your niece and nephews come barreling out of the first floor apartment, all late for school. You see like putting shoes and stuff on."
"Niece and nephews: Morning, Uncle Kingston!"
Kingston: Good morning.
"Niece and nephews: [strapping stuff on] Oh, man. Late for school."
Kingston: Why y'all late for school?
"Niece and nephews: Well, it was--"
Brennan: Your cousin Claude leans his head out and says:
"Claude: Late for school 'cause of video games. What are you gonna do? How you doing, Kingston?"
"Kingston: I'm doing well, Claude. How are you?"
"Claude: You know, another morning."
Brennan: You see he says:
Claude: Didn't you work graveyard last night?
Kingston: Of course.
Claude: You're gonna make yourself sick. Why are you doing that?
"Kingston: I ain't gonna make myself sick. I'm 55 years old, all right? I can take care of my damn self, Claude. Why don't you work on getting your children to school on time?"
Brennan: Claude is— you can feel the spiritual energy of your cousin being put in his place. And he's like—
"Lou: Oh. And then I put a hand on his shoulder. I'm like,"
"Kingston: Being a father is tough, and I understand that."
"Brennan: You see that little Cooper looks up at you, who's your 9-year-old nephew. You see, he goes:"
"Cooper: Uncle Kingston, why didn't you ever have kids?"
Kingston: Mmm! I'll see y'all children later.
"Brennan: You head out the door. You start walking down the street. You see that from all around the neighborhood, you hear,"
"Johnny: [fast-talking New Yorker] Hey, Kingston Brown! How's it goin', man?"
"Kingston: Hey, how you doin', Johnny?"
"Johnny: I'm doing all right. You know, keeping out of trouble. Hey, thanks for that thing with my sister, man. You're a real swell guy."
"Kingston: Hey, man. We're family. We take care of each other, all right? You're on the block, you come ask Kingston. You need something, I give it to you."
Brennan: You see that he claps you on the shoulder.
You go to the corner store. You see Cosmo's there at the register. You see he says:
"Cosmo: [deeper, raspy voice] Hey, there he is."
"Kingston: Hey, what's goin' on, Cos?"
Brennan: You see he puts the coffee in front of you.
Kingston: Oh. Is this the way I like it?
Cosmo: As always.
Kingston: Black as hell. Just like me.
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: You see he smiles and says,"
"Cosmo: All right, man. You take it easy. Hey, thanks for that thing with my brother, by the way. That was a real—"
"Kingston: Hey, man. We're family, all right? On this block, if I can help you, you come find me. I will."
Brennan: You take off. You walk right out into traffic.
[Lou and Zac laugh in shock]
"Brennan: At this point, the cars would never dream of hitting you here. Not in your neighborhood."
Lou: Never.
Brennan: See the cars [vroom]-- yeah. It's perfectly-- you do not need to break your stride for the cars to effortlessly zoom past you in all directions. You get to the other side. You walk over to the bus stop. The bus pulls in. Suzette pulls up in the bus. You see she says:
"Suzette: Good morning, Mr. Kingston."
"Kingston: Good morning, Suzette."
"Suzette: Oh, it's wonderful to see you."
Kingston: Wonderful to see you as well. It had been so long since I was on the bus ride home.
"Suzette: I know! Well, I'm glad to see you're up and at them again."
Kingston: Of course.
"Brennan: As you take your first step onto the bus, you see that, with no touch of anything, the little light flicks green. Your fare is taken care of by the city itself. You walk onto the bus and you start to head off towards St. Owen's. Arriving at St. Owen's, what is one of the first things that Kingston gets up to in his day?"
"Lou: Walk straight up to the receptionist, take out the Tupperware that my mother gave me. Give it to her."
"Receptionist: [high voice, very accented] Oh my god, I forgot to bring lunch!"
Kingston: I thought so.
Receptionist: Oh my god. How do you know this stuff?
"Kingston: Hey, what can I say? I know my people, I know my city."
Brennan: You see she says:
Receptionist: This smells delicious.
"Kingston: Well, I can't say I made it, but I can promise it's good."
Brennan: You see she smiles and says:
Receptionist: I'll give your best to my mother.
Kingston: Of course.
Brennan: You begin your day. You say hi to Emiko Matsui. She looks over and says:
"Emiko: Kingston, there's a busy day ahead of us here."
Kingston: OK.
"Emiko: That guy, Lowell Masters, came in again. He's back with a similar problem from last time."
"Kingston: OK, well, somebody needs to talk to him."
"Brennan: She hands you a chart and brings you over to a room. You see that this guy is in here. You see he's kind of a older, balding guy. He sort of looks like one of these New York guys. Just a neighborhood guy. He's got a thick mustache. Looks up and you see he goes:"
"Lowell: OK. Look, I'll tell you exactly what happened."
Kingston: Mm-hmmm.
"Lowell: So, it's pretty standard. So, I go around because in the subways and stuff, there's a lot of cool stuff down there. And I found this-- looked like some kind of bronze statue of a falcon or something like that. I thought I would pawn it for a little bit of money. But what I needed to do is I needed to varnish it, right? To get some of the rust off."
Kingston: Mm-hmmm.
"Lowell: So I put some varnish on it. And then what happened was I was getting ready for a shower, so I was naked of course. You understand, right? And before I take a shower, I like to have a little bowl of cereal. Just something I like to do."
Kingston: Lowell? I'ma stop you right now.
Lowell: What happened is the cereal is up on a tall shelf--
Kingston: Lowell?
Lowell: So there's a stepladder to get up there--
"Kingston: Lowell! You got to stop coming in here, Lowell. You got to fix your life, all right, Lowell? Because I know for a fact-- Lowell, cut to the end of the story."
Lowell: I fell off the ladder and the statue went up my butt.
"Kingston: Yep. Lowell, have you ever tried a therapist instead of a medical doctor?"
Lowell: No. What happened was it was an accident and it got up there.
"Kingston: Oh? OK, Lowell-- Lowell, this is the fourth time you've come up here with something in your butt. Let's be real right now, Lowell. Let's be real right now. Lowell, how many times have you come up here with stuff in your butt?"
Lowell: Four times.
Kingston: Four times.
[beat]
"We're gonna take the thing out your butt, I'm not saying I'm gonna deny you medical services. I'm just saying that you need to ask yourself some questions because I tell you--"
Lou: I get in real close.
[soft music]
"Kingston: Ain't nothin' wrong with being kinky. I tell you that right now. I'm not kinky, but ain't nothin' wrong with bein' kinky. Alright? So, you want to be kinky, that's fine. Just be kinky safely, alright?"
"Lowell: Yeah, but you mean that? That really--"
Kingston: 100%. Ain't nothing wrong with being a freak.
[Emily and Brennan laugh]
"Lowell: You're a good man. You're a good man, nurse Brown. I appreciate that."
Kingston: Of course.
Lowell: You're a good man.
Kingston: Of course. You're a--
Lowell: I appreciate--
"Kingston: No, no. What were you gonna say?"
"Lowell: I just-- no one's ever told me that before and I find a lot of this cool treasures and artifacts and stuff like that, and I put them up my butt, and it's never-- I just like the feeling of it going up there, knowing that someone put a lot of time and effort into this sort of thing, and--"
"Kingston: Hey. Hey, I get it. You got some-- you like fucking artifacts, or having artifacts fuck you, or something like that. I'm not trying to get into it. That's your business. But you just need to figure out how you can do it safely because I'll tell you, it's expensive to come to the hospital. It's expensive. Stop paying all this money."
"Lowell: You know, money is no object for me because I do sell these artifacts afterwards."
"Kingston: Oh, for good money. What? I'm sorry, what? You selling--"
"Lowell: No. No, no, no. I clean 'em, I clean 'em."
"Kingston: OK. You know what, Mr. Masters?"
Lowell: I better head out. I'm gonna--
Kingston: You better head out.
Lowell: I'm gonna get ready for the operation.
Kingston: Of course.
"Brennan: It's great. It actually does look like a tremendous spiritual weight has been lifted from him. A weird, self-loathing is now gone. He seems sort of at peace."
"It's a couple hours later. You're talking with a buddy of yours. This is actually one of the many trolls that populate the rivers around New York City. It's a bridge and tunnel troll, so he's a buddy of yours who works under the George Washington Bridge. You see he's going:"
"Troll: [a little raspy] Thanks again, man. This is great. So, basically, I just-- I take this and the warts will start coming back?"
"Kingston: Exactly, and if you wanna spend some more time around water, that wouldn't be a bad idea."
Troll: OK. It's just hard. I haven't actually been in the river now 'cause the whole thing is it's all electronic these days.
"Kingston: I mean, exactly."
"Troll: Back in the old days, trolls would have to jump out and actually collect a toll--"
Kingston: Mm-hmmm.
Troll: Or do a riddle or something.
Kingston: Mm-hmmm.
"Troll: And now, you just solve the EZ Pass and whatever else."
"Kingston: Exactly. So, hey, that just means we've got to put in that extra effort. But there's time in the day. There's always time in the day. You just gotta find it."
"Troll: You're not wrong, man--"
[sound of doors swinging open]
Brennan: Boom! Doors swing open and Ricky Matsui comes in with Pete the Plug under his arm.
Kingston: Ricky!
Pete: Put me down!
"Ricky: You're gonna be OK, sir."
"Kingston: Ricky, what's goin' on? Have y'all-- y'all two been jumpin' on buildings again?"
Ricky: I have.
"Kingston: Ricky, I told you to stop jumpin' on buildings."
Ricky: You're right. I should be-- I can do it very carefully and I don't suggest many other people-- I've got a very sweet smelling man here.
Pete: Excuse me?
"Kingston: I'm sorry, sweet smellin'?"
"Pete: I don't know what you meant by that, but yeah, my tooth fell off and now it's a candy. Hey, how much is this gonna cost?"
Kingston: All right.
"Pete: Just walkin' through this door, I feel like I owe you 500 bucks."
"Kingston: All right. Well, money is not a--"
Lou: Can I pull them into a quiet room or a room that I know?
"Brennan: Kingston, you walk over to a supply closet and through the supply closet, a door that opens only to you, and the subway token around your neck glows bright, opens a room that you use for when people from the Unsleeping City come here opens to you. Pete, you see this weird magic door open up into this side chamber. Ricky, you've been in here before. You see your sister looks over at you as you're walking into it and says:"
"Emiko: Ricky, what are you doing here?"
"Ricky: Oh, my friend is Kingston, and we're gonna talk about--"
"Kingston: Yeah, me and--"
Ricky: -- cars.
Kingston: -- Ricky are friends. We like to… [unconvincingly] bowl.
Pete: How did that door open?
Kingston: Oh!
Brennan: You see that Emiko looks over and says:
Emiko: What door?
Brennan: And you look and see that the open door is covered in the same weird flickering shadow fire that I described from the guys before. And you see that Emiko cannot see the open door.
Pete: Hospitals have so much money now. It's crazy.
Ricky: You take--
Kingston: I take him and we take-- great. Fantastic.
Lou: I take Pete in the—
"Brennan: The doors close. Pete, you're in there with Kingston."
Lou: Can I cast Detect Poison and Disease?
"Brennan: Yes, you can. You hold out your hand. [spell energy whoosh] You know that today is SantaCon. Normally, it's a little bit of a hassle to clean up all those clones. This is something you haven't seen before. This is a very virulent, dangerous thing. There is some kind of arcane virus that is turning this kid's bones into peppermint."
Kingston: What happened to you?
Pete: How much can I tell you? Can you turn me into the cops?
Kingston: What? No. What are you talking about? We're in a magic room right now.
"Pete: I don't know. Look, man. OK, fine. I took some mushrooms."
Kingston: You took some mushrooms?
Pete: I took more than normal and then my dad floated away on a bubble and a man hit my face.
Kingston: A man hit your face? Who hit your face?
Pete: He bit my face.
Kingston: A man bit your face. Who bit your face?
"Pete: It was after I pushed a happy face button, and I let it all out."
Kingston: You let-- sorry. OK.
Pete: Darkness.
"Kingston: Now, I need to understand. This disease looks like you were bitten by a Santa Claus?"
Pete: Mm-hmmm.
Kingston: OK. Oh.
Lou: Is there something I can do-- what can I do with what I know?
"Brennan: Give me a-- Because you had the spell up, so give me a Medicine check with advantage because you're actively looking at it right now."
Lou: Great. OK. So that's 22 and something that's not— way less than 22.
Brennan: Cool. You-- go ahead also and give me an Arcana check.
Lou: Great. 10.
Brennan: OK. You ascertain what's going on. This kid has a magical disease that you think you can treat here in the room with what you've got.
Lou: OK.
"Brennan: There is something much deeper and more profound, magically happening, that you don't think is an external virus. You think that there's something medical or otherwise going on with this kid-- period."
Lou: Great. All right.
"Kingston: What's your name, son?"
Pete: Jeffrey.
"Kingston: All right, Jeffrey. I'm going to work on what is the problem right now, the thing that's got your teeth popping out."
Pete: Yeah.
Kingston: But we should talk after that 'cause--
Pete: Yeah. Yeah.
Kingston: There's something going on.
Pete: OK. Yeah. I actually have a doctor. So if you could just tell me what you were gonna do.
"Kingston: Oh, yeah? Who's your doctor? I could pull your records. What's your doctor's name?"
Pete: He's a different kind of doctor-- you probably don't know him.
Kingston: A different-- what's a different kind of doctor?
Pete: He's just like-- he's probably not-- you don't know him. Different service.
Kingston: Give me-- give it a shot.
"Pete: He doesn't work in a place like this, OK? He works--"
Kingston: Give it a shot. What's his name?
Pete: Hm?
Kingston: What's his name?
Pete: Doctor-- Dr. Brinman.
Kingston: Brinman?
[Brennan wheezes like an old man]
Pete: Doctor--
Ally: I look at my bracelet. What does it say?
Brennan: Dr. Lugash Primjitzki.
Pete: It's Dr. Primjitzki.
Kingston: Oh. Why didn't you say so?
Pete: Really?
Kingston: Of course!
"Pete: Oh, OK, good."
Kingston: Works at the warehouse down in Brooklyn?
"Pete: Yes, yes."
Kingston: Of course!
Pete: Exactly.
Kingston: Fantastic doctor.
Pete: Above the popcorn machine.
"Kingston: Yes. Honestly, surprisingly good for working under the table like he does. That man could work in a hospital like this, walk away with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. But he's a good man."
"Pete: So much money, man."
"Kingston: I mean, what can I say? I'm speaking in hyperbole, as they say. No, he could make a lot of money. He's a good doctor. Anyway--"
Lou: Can I set to fixing the—
"Brennan: You put a syringe together. There's a lot of stuff in this room that is traditional medicine, mixed with stuff that is just some arcane tinctures, different things. There's like fucking basilisk venom in here and unicorn blood and all that crazy shit. You put a syringe together, alcohol swab the area. You administer it and Pete—"
[soft piano music]
"You feel the pain stop almost immediately. And not only that, but you feel a sense of Christmas cheer enter your body for a second and you still got that one peppermint tooth there. But other than that, it appears like you're healed or better."
"Ally: Oh, OK."
"Brennan: And you also feel a sense of-- there's a moment where, after you get the shot, you two feel something. Each of you guys roll a-- just a Wisdom check. Actually, you roll a Charisma check, you roll a Wisdom check."
"Lou: Uh, 19."
Ally: Over 20.
"Brennan: Ooh, awesome! As you are healed, you look up and you are looking at Pete and see this weird hallucinatory thing of bright lights, big city, marquee, and twirling gouts of colorful magic. You look at Kingston and see a golden light setting in between the rows of buildings, and this feeling of a golden light in the heart of a happy city full of people and neighbors all beating together in one heart. And your guys magic touches and steams, but then unites in some kind of helix and disappears."
Kingston: The hell—
Pete: Whoa!
Kingston: Are you— ?
Pete: Get away from me!
Kingston: What did you do to me?
Pete: I don't know.
"Kingston: I've been doing this for 30 years, I've never seen nothing like that."
Pete: Fuck! What's happening?
Kingston: I don't know. Where did you come from?
"Pete: I don't know. I'm on a lot of meds right now, so maybe that was a weird combination."
Kingston: OK.
"Brennan: Go ahead, roll actually just a History check for me."
"Lou: Oh, look at that. Over 20."
Brennan: You know who can help you figure out whatever the fuck this is.
"Kingston: Oh, fantastic. You know, what are you doing today? You got some time?"
Pete: I was gonna-- yeah. I probably got some--
Kingston: I've got a friend who could help us understand what's going on right now.
"Pete: OK, is it that weird buff dude?"
"Kingston: No, it's not that weird buff dude, but he's probably gonna come along. He's-- I don't know. What do you think of him?"
Pete: I feel like he would bully me.
"Kingston: Nah, he's a nice dude. He's a nice dude. A little dumb. Very nice."
Pete: He's like a golden retriever.
"Kingston: Mmm, I like that. I haven't heard that one before."
"Brennan: You guys step outside. Ricky, your sister's going:"
"Emiko: --That NY One interview. Look, a lot of my friends are single. It would be easy."
"Ricky: Yeah. I just-- you know-- I appreciate that. I'm just looking for someone that has a certain-- your friends are nice, but I'm just kind of focusing on my career right now."
"Emiko: Fine, fine, fine."
"Brennan: You guys walk out. You see Kingston and Pete. Pete looks healthy again. And you guys take off into the snow. Heh, heh. [rolls a die] Bod a boom, bod a bam!"
"[bass-heavy music, a little funky]"
"Brennan: The snow whirls out as Kingston, Ricky, and Pete all head out from there, up into the sky, settling down, Central Park, in the middle of one of the streets that crosses the park down through the manhole cover to water that melts into the dank, grimy, filthy, subway tunnels of New York City. A couple of MTA workers, with their lanterns up, pick away at the side of the wall, doing some repairs from water damage. And one of them says:"
"Wally: [high voice, cartoonish] I'm telling you guys I seen it. It was this size-- it was this freaking big. It was the size of a freaking dog, I swear to God."
"MTA worker: Shut the fuck up, Wally. You did not see a rat the size of a dog."
"Wally: I swear to God I did. It was huge! The thing was fucking enormous! It was all-- I don't know. When it came out, I said, I see it going, ""Ah!"" and it looked-- and it looked right at me, and I swear to God, it smiled!"
"Brennan: He says,"
MTA worker: You're fucking crazy. You're always talking about rats and fucking rat kings.
Wally: Rat kings are real! You guys-- you better wake up 'cause rat kings are real! They live in the sewers. They're all tied together by their tails. It's real.
"Brennan: So, the guys walk away and say,"
"MTA worker: Wally, you're a fucking idiot."
"Brennan: Walk away, Wally goes,"
"Wally: You know, you say that now, but—"
[funky bass music playing]
"Brennan: From the steel rafters overhead, hidden in darkness, is our friend Kugrash. Murph, could you please describe Kugrash for us?"
"Murph: [low, raspy voice, New York accent] Yes. I'm Kugrash. I look like a fucked-up Master Splinter. I've got a hooked humpback, I'm about two feet tall. I'm a rat man. I've got a rusty metal staff that looks like a pipe, and then I wear rags made out of discarded MTA employee clothes. And I live in the subway tunnels and I take care of the discarded people of New York, and the little beasts and the cockroaches. I am the shit that feeds the flies. A dumpster druid."
"Brennan: Kugrash, you look down at Wally, who goes,"
"Wally: OK. You guys believe what you want, but I know what I saw."
"Kugrash: Hey, Wally."
Wally: Aah! Who's there? Jesus? [a beat] Jesus Christ?
Murph: I just make some chittering sound.
"Wally: You turned into a rat. It's a miracle. Wherever you are, Rat Jesus, I love you."
Kugrash: [to himself] Such a sweet man.
"Brennan: Kugrash, it's the day of SantaCon. You're scampering around. What are you getting up to on a day like today?"
"Murph: I think,"
Kugrash: We are absolutely fucked this year. We are fucked every year. We are not prepared.
Murph: I'm trying to find homeless people and get them indoors and things like that.
"Brennan: You scurry around. You find a couple of guys. Some of the homeless who have been around long enough actually can see you now and know who you are. A couple of them-- you show up with food for them. They go,"
"Homeless person: Oh, Kugrash. Thanks, pal."
"Kugrash: Yeah, a lot of this stuff people just-- a lot of this stuff is bread from restaurants. People take it in their takeout bags. They think they're going to eat it and they don't eat the bread, but it's still good bread. I eat the real shitty stuff. You can have the good stuff."
"Homeless person: I appreciate it, man. It's real nice of you."
"Brennan: Had some bread-- you're skipping around, go ahead, give me an Investigate check."
Murph: Sure. Not great. 11.
"Brennan: You've been looking around. Normally, in this insane day where all these fucking mutant Santas fill the Unsleeping City and regular humans only see it as a pub crawl, but all the magical denizens of New York know that it's this weird thing where a bunch of gross mutants bumble around until they get cleaned up."
"You normally find a bag of hot cocoa and treats and stuff from Santa Claus that he leaves for you to distribute to homeless people and things like that. It's getting later in the day and you haven't found it yet. [eerie music] And you haven't heard from him at all, which is weird."
"Kugrash: Santa, you fucking bum. Where the hell are you, dude? Where the hell is this dude?"
"Brennan: As you're scurrying around though, you see an unconscious Sofia passed out in some garbage, a little bit covered in snow."
Kugrash: You gotta be kidding. [holds his arms out to indicate Sofia] People just-- we just walking past this. We just see somebody passed out. She's using a trash bag as a sleeping bag. We're just gonna-- ? All right. Everybody's walking-- all right. I'll do it.
"Murph: I see that she's missing her shoes. And I guess I probably have a little pack of little plastic bags and things with me, so I make her some makeshift plastic bag shoes with rubber bands."
"Brennan: Incredible. Sofia, you wake up with new plastic shoes—"
Sofia: Oh my god.
"Brennan: —and maybe a little bit of food next to you. And you see you're incredibly hungover. And you see for the first time, through sober eyes, Kugrash in front of you."
"Kugrash: Oh, hey, it's you again."
Sofia: Oh my god. Are you real?
Kugrash: We hung— we talked about your ex-husband for like a while— Dale.
Sofia: I know.
"Kugrash: For three hours, you and I hung out."
Sofia: I know. I have that memory. I just thought that maybe it was too many wine coolers.
Kugrash: You were insanely drunk. But you can hold it. You were having a conversation.
Sofia: I'm sorry. Are you a rat?
"Kugrash: Sort of, I am a rat man."
"Sofia: Is this a SantaCon outfit? Oh, you're in a SantaCon outfit. I don't understand it thematically."
Kugrash: Do not compare me to those fucks. All right?
"Sofia: Oh, OK."
Kugrash: I gave you—
Sofia: Someone from outside of New York comes in and everyone hates them. Is that what it is because they're from New Jersey?
Kugrash: What happened to your face? You got punched?
"Sofia: Yeah, but I mean, you should see the other guy-- is what Dale used to say."
"Kugrash: Were they SantaCon-- ? Oh my, Dale again."
Sofia: [laughing sadly] Yeah.
Kugrash: Were they SantaCon guys?
"Sofia: No. It was-- I mean, my memory's a little hazy, but it was these guys and they were messing with these girls. And then I got in the way, and I made sure the girls were taken care of."
"Kugrash: That's good, you know, there's not enough people like that anymore."
Sofia: Yeah. And they were tall. They were really tall. I'll leave it at that.
"Brennan: Kugrash, you see two little cockroaches out in this cold weather, which is crazy, skittering across a railing very, very fast. And you see that they have two little hobo sacks over their shoulder and are skittering along a railing."
"Kugrash: Hey, Fred! Marty!"
"Cockroach: [high squeaky voice] Hey, what's going on, buddy?"
Kugrash: Where are you guys going?
Cockroach: We're getting the fuck out of here!
"Kugrash: Oh, yeah. SantaCon? Did you see what happened to this lady?"
"Cockroach: No, not SantaCon. Some shit just went down at the park."
Kugrash: Some shit just went down at the park?
"Cockroach: Yeah, it was crazy."
"Kugrash: Well, fuck me. What happened at the park?"
"Cockroach: I don't know. There was like-- what do you call it? There was a horse carriage but with no wheels. It was just the carriage part, no wheels on it. And there was a bunch of horses that had these big fucking tumors coming out of their head."
"Kugrash: Reindeer, yeah. They're-- Santa. You've certainly-- you've--"
Cockroach: What?
Kugrash: Santa!
Cockroach: No. These horses had fucked-up tumors coming out of their fucking head!
Kugrash: It's called-- it's called a reindeer!
Cockroach: What?
Kugrash: Don't worry about it. I don't need to teach you about--
Cockroach: There were these fucked-up horses with big fuck--
Kugrash: So Santa is in the park?
"Cockroach: Well, I don't know 'cause it was like a blast of green light and shit like that. And a fucking horse just took off. I hope to go see a doctor because he's fucking--"
Kugrash: [incredulously] Is Santa dead? Did somebody shoot Santa?
"Cockroach: I don't know, dude! I'm not-- I'm not religious."
"Kugrash: All right. Thanks. Thanks, Fred. Thanks, Marty."
"Cockroach: Take care, bud."
Brennan: And you see the two cockroaches--
Sofia: I'm sorry—
Kugrash: Santa Claus is real and he's dead.
"Sofia: OK. I'm sorry. Rewind. You just made cockroach noises. You just hissed at some cockroaches who hissed back at you for what looked like a conversation. I mean, they gestured and everything."
"Kugrash: Yeah, well, we just made cock—"
Sofia: And then you said something to me about Santa?
Kugrash: We were just making bug noises for a full minute.
Sofia and Kugrash: [together] Yeah.
Kugrash: Yeah. So I understand animals and they understand me. Some of it I picked up over the years.
Sofia: From being an animal.
Kugrash: I'm a rat man. We should go to the park. Santa might be dead.
Sofia: [defeated] Why not?
[cast laughs]
Sofia: Let me get a walk-me-down and we can go.
Kugrash: You know what? Why not? I'll have some too. I can't go in there. I'm a rat.
Sofia: Right. Sean? Sean?
Brennan: You see that Sean literally picks the iron up.
"Sean: Jesus Christ, you're wearing the same clothes as last night."
Sofia: Is it a different day?
"Sean: It's a full different day, yeah."
Sofia: Give me a couple of Mike's Hard.
[Brennan wheezes like an old man again]
Kugrash: Don't!
Sean: You want that-- you want that in a coffee cup?
Sofia: Can I get one of those buckets that you put the Coronas in?
Sean: Full of Mike's Hards?
Sofia: Yeah. Like a painter's bucket.
Sean: I'll see if we got a box.
"Brennan: He goes downstairs. Minutes later, you are walking down the street with a full bucket full of hard lemonade."
Murph: I crack one.
Emily: I'm swinging it.
"Kugrash: I'm Kugrash, by the way. I don't know if you remember--"
Sofia: Kugrash.
"Kugrash: Sofia, right? Yeah."
Sofia: I'm Sofia Lee-- Bicicleta.
Kugrash: Lee. Yeah. We've met.
Sofia: Yeah. I am sorry that I don't remember you.
Kugrash: It's OK.
"Sofia: But I will remember you now because I'm very sober right now. In fact, somewhat sick."
"Kugrash: Yeah, let's get a little fucked up and go see if Santa's dead, huh?"
Sofia: I think that sounds good.
Kugrash: Alright.
Brennan: You guys head over to the park. Each of you guys make an Investigate check for me. Feel free if you want to cast any magic as well to do that.
Murph: I got a 4.
Emily: 9.
Brennan: 4 and 9. You guys wander around in the park for a while.
Emily: But do we find a hot dog stand?
Brennan: You guys for sure find a hot dog stand. You see the guy says:
"Hot dog vendor: [slight Slavic accent] Hey, boss. I get you a hot dog? Hot dog?"
Kugrash: [hesitantly] Yeah.
Sofia: Yeah.
Murph: I lower my face so no one sees I'm a rat.
"Sofia: I got him, I got him. Two hot dogs, thank you."
"Brennan: Puts two hot dogs there. See, he goes:"
"Hot dog vendor: It's crazy 'cause there was a-- I don't know if you guys heard, there was a fight out in the promenade past here a little while ago."
"Sofia: Oh, yeah?"
Hot dog vendor: Yeah.
Brennan: He points through some--
Sofia: Who was getting into it?
"Brennan: He points through some hedges heading off towards Belvedere Castle, where the woods get a little thicker in the park."
"Sofia: Mmm. Hey, you want to go hiking?"
"Kugrash: Yeah, let's go into the bushes."
Sofia: Yeah.
Kugrash: Yeah.
Brennan: You guys head into the bushes. Give me a nature check.
Murph: OK. I'm a little bit better at that. 22!
Brennan: You go through the skittering thing. You see some squirrels.
"Squirrel: [high voice, cheerful] Oh, hey there, Kugrash!"
"Kugrash: Hey, what's up? What's up, Lenny?"
"Lenny: Oh, nothing much. Christmas time. You know, it's easy to go--"
"Kugrash: Yeah, yeah, Christmas."
Lenny: We love Christmas.
"Kugrash: It's fucking wonderful, man."
Lenny: I stole someone's keys.
Kugrash: You stole-- ? Why the fuck? Lenny.
Lenny: Who knows?
"Kugrash: You fucking sociopath, give me the keys."
"Lenny: Fuck you, dude."
"Kugrash: Dude, fuck you. No. Why?"
Brennan: Takes off through the branches.
"Kugrash: Lenny, you fucking cock. He's a dickhead. Fucking squirrel just steals shit and puts it in their trees."
"Sofia: I'm sorry. Once again, rewind. There was a bunch of gesticulation."
"Kugrash: Oh, he told me to-- he said fuck you. He ran off."
"Sofia: Yeah, I saw he had a set of keys on him."
Kugrash: He just took 'em!
"Brennan: You guys arrive in a clearing. [eerie music] You see that there is an enormous, polished red sleigh. The area where reindeer would be attached to the sleigh has been severed and there is a giant glove box torn out of the front of the sleigh. And there are things scattered throughout. It looks like people have been like rummaging through the sleigh here."
"You see that there is peppermint-smelling blood, white and red blood spattered everywhere around here. You see that there are also a number of small, little green ivy leaves. With that 22 nature check, these leaves are not from the Waking World. These are from Nod, the Sixth Borough. These are-- in fact, with a 22, you smell them. This is faerie magic that happened here. Maybe not the peppermint blood, but there's faerie magic happening here."
"Kugrash: Oh, it is the goddamn pixies."
Sofia: What? I thought this is just a place kids take pictures with Santa.
"Kugrash Do you see what-- ? They mugged Santa, they stole all of his shit."
"Sofia: OK, again. Santa’s real and you're a rat."
Kugrash: Santa’s-- the pixies did this!
Sofia: OK.
Kugrash: Those sons of bitches. They're serious. This is bad. Santa's fucked.
Sofia: All right.
Kugrash: We are fucked.
"Sofia: I'm just going with this ride. All right, yeah."
"Brennan: You notice that there is a little glyph carved into the wood at the front of the sleigh that looks like it was broken somehow. It's some faerie shit that you don't know about, but you do know who does."
"Kugrash: I think I know somebody who might be able to read this bullshit, whatever the fuck this is."
"Sofia: Yeah, this is-- this isn't Greek or anything like that."
"Kugrash: Oh, you speak Greek?"
"Sofia: No, but I mean, I'm Catholic so I've encountered Greek in a religious sense."
Kugrash: That's good.
Sofia: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah. So you take off from there.
"Murph: Yeah, I'll take off for—"
Brennan: You guys both head out from there. No need to roll.
[peppy jazz]
"The snow kicks off from the park and whisks all the way downtown, past Columbus Circle from all the way to [singing] Broadway!, where we see a line of fans clamoring and cheering, holding their Playbills from different shows because they're in line for a show that actually hasn't opened yet. They were lucky enough to see some previews for Midsummer Nights, a musical version of Shakespeare's classic, A Midsummer Night's Dream. Why not take the bard's original plays and make them a musical?"
"The Times Square billboards show all of the signs for the show coming up. The fans are out in the cold in the snow, waiting. The stage door opens with a dramatic swing. And Siobhan, could you please describe your character for us?"
"Siobhan: Darlings, sweeties. I'm Misty Moore. I'm a Broadway diva, lover of music, lover of energy, lover of dance and light and stars and music and brilliance. I'm-- well, a lady would never say her age, so I won't. I'm four foot something, maybe 5'1"" in a beautiful high heel. Always wear a tap shoe, even outside. And I'm just loving life, loving love."
Brennan: You step out. The crowd erupts into cheers. Your assistant Alissa and your pianist Benjamin are behind you. They walk out.
"Fans: Aah! Misty, Misty, Misty!"
Misty smiles campily and waves at them.
"Brennan: You see that there is a girl with pigtails and braces, clearly some 16-year-old, Midwestern girl. She goes:"
"Girl: [sobbing] Oh my god, Misty Moore! This is a poster of the original cast recording company."
"Misty: [transatlantic, distinguished accent] Oh my goodness, I haven't seen one of these in years. I mean, obviously, I have the one in my apartment, which is signed by all of the cast. But this-- a blank one. Oh, I haven't seen one in years."
"Girl: [sobbing] Oh, my God, it’s incredible. We just saw the show. We were lucky enough to go see it. You were amazing!"
"Misty: Oh, I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so blessed and honored to do this work. You know, for people like you, I don't do it for me, I do it for people like you."
"Brennan: As you say that, you see that her and the other young girls and boys around her all are just salivating. You see that they all say back there:"
Fans: My favorite song of yours-- I actually did one of your songs and I did it in the way you did it-- when it was in-- the high school play that I did it.
[eerie music]
"Brennan: A burgeoning, sweet silvery, golden pink, and purple light begins to come off of them. And though they cannot see it, you certainly can. And up into your nostrils. And you feel like a million bucks."
"Misty: You know, as actors, all of us. Us actors, we're just—"
"Fans: We’re-- You put us in the word ""we"" with yourself! Blah!"
Brennan: They just go fucking nuts. You see Alissa bends over as you're signing stuff. And you see she says:
"Alissa: [rushed, worried] Obviously, of course, take as much time as you need, Ms. Moore, but we do have an appointment. There's an interview happening back at your penthouse."
"Misty: How do you spell Rebecca, darling? I don't want to spell it wrong."
"Rebecca: Oh my god, you know, R-E-B-E-C-C-A. Some people call me Becca, some people call me Rebecca, I wish to do things better, I don't know for a stage name. I haven't signed up for that yet. I really wanna-- I really wanna move to New York. Do you think that's a bad idea?"
"Misty: Everybody should move to New York. But you know, some people should leave. But you don't know until you get here, darling."
Rebecca: I can't wait to come here!
"Brennan: Again, you just see these little silvery sparks come off of them and you feel amazing. You leave from this place. You head back to your wonderful penthouse."
Siobhan: I pour myself a Vodka on the rocks.
Brennan: You see Benjamin looks over you and says:
"Benjamin: [deadpan, deeper voice] Really, you asked how to spell Rebecca? How many times have you spelled Rebecca in your life?"
Misty: I don't know. Some people are weird and there's an H in there. I don’t—
Benjamin: I guess you're right.
"Brennan: You walk into your penthouse. Huge entire walls are just glass windows. Central Park South, looking out over the park. Alissa comes over and brings a reporter in from some entertainment magazine."
"Reporter: [lower, slightly raspy voice] Hi, Ms. Moore. I'll be doing the interview with you today. So, a pleasure to meet you. Talk to me about working with Perry LaFev again."
"Misty: Perry, my darling Perry. It's such an honor. It's been such a time since we've worked together. Oh, he's such a beautiful director. You know, just a beautiful man. And we sit and we really dig into this work. [gesticulates a lot] We dig into it together. And we're really creating this character because obviously, we all know the Shakespeare, Midsummer Night's Dream. It's, for so many people, the first Shakespeare that anybody does. But we're really trying to take a new twist on it. A really new bent on this character of Titania."
"Brennan: Writing all this down, he says:"
Reporter: And you're gonna be playing Titania.
"Misty: Yes, I am Titania, queen of the fairies, who, obviously in the original play, has a smaller role. But I really feel like we've beefed it up. And I'm not a young woman anymore, but I really feel like I can hold myself on that stage. And well, I don't want to spoil it too much for the fans, but I think they're in for a surprise. [taps her nose]"
"Brennan: As you say that, you are no longer a young woman--"
[soft music]
"You look down at your hand and you do in fact see some liver spots, some light things here. And you can feel something twinge inside you. It's been maybe 40 or 50 years since the last time you did it, and you can feel this body starting to tell you that the time is fast approaching."
"Misty: [shakes her head, quietly] Yeah. [looks up, suddenly cheerful] But that's showbiz!"
"Brennan: You continue talking in this interview. You're having your lovely little vodka, it’s wonderful, and the preview went smashingly. You suddenly hear a noise coming from the boiler. You have one of those things where you have your own heating and own everything so you don't have to deal with anyone else. But a little hall closet door opens up and an air vent pops out. Kugrash and Sofia—"
"Sofia: Oh my god, you are a trip to hang out with, Kugrash."
"Kugrash: This is the real New York. You know, you know."
Sofia: I'm loving it. This is where I belong.
"Misty: [hurriedly] So anyway, I am so terribly sorry, but I do have a show at 8:00. So Alissa?"
"Alissa: Oh, sorry. Coming right now, I'm so sorry. I will-- that will not happen again."
"Misty: [intimidatingly] Yes. No, it won't."
[Ally and Brennan laughing]
Brennan: You see that she-- she comes over and says:
"Alissa: That's all. Ms. Moore needs her vocal rest. Thank you so much. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye."
"Brennan: She ushers him out. You turn around. Your beautiful, cream white carpets are decked with filth as Kugrash walks in with Sofia."
"Sofia: Oh, my god, Kug, is that Misty Moore?"
Kugrash: Yeah. It's Misty.
Sofia: [gasps]
"Kugrash: Hey, Misty, it's good to see you again."
Sofia: I saw you in Kinky Boots!
Misty: You did?
Sofia: Oh my god.
"Misty: Oh, what a beautiful show."
Sofia: You radiated. You made that show.
"Misty: Oh, thank you so much. It's such a beautiful story. You know, it's so important."
Sofia: The boots.
"Misty: Oh, I love those boots. So kinky."
Kugrash: [together with Misty] They're so kinky.
Sofia: They're so kinky.
"Kugrash: Hey, Misty. We think Santa might be dead. Do you know what this weird pixie shit is?"
Murph: And I guess— do— could I have taken— was it on the sleigh?
"Brennan: It was, but you could have made— it was on the glove compartment door. You could have broken it off."
Murph: OK. OK. It has saliva all over it. I ripped it out with my mouth.
Misty: Oh.
Kugrash: Yeah. You wanna read that? Do you need to take a closer—? No?
"Misty: Why don't you put it down on the coffee table right here? Yes, the pixies, the park pixies? Don Confetti and all of his people?"
Kugrash: Yes. I think we found—
Misty: Ugh. I hate that little man.
Kugrash: Yeah.
Misty sets her shoulders and sighs.
Siobhan: Can I read it? What do I read?
"Brennan: You can absolutely read it. Let me know if you're doing any magic or stuff to it. Or, you can go ahead and make either an Arcana check--"
"Siobhan: I mean, if it's seelie, I speak seelie."
"Brennan: Yeah, it is seelie."
"Siobhan: Great. Then I can just read it. I can also do an Arcana check, but my arcana level is— [in Misty's voice] darling, I don't study magic. I just am magic."
"Brennan: You look at it. [serious music] You recognize one element of this, which is immediately troubling to you. This is a clear fae rune. All it is about, basically, is about breaking a ward on something, breaking magical wards, which would make sense 'cause Santa's sleigh would be warded beyond imagination."
"The thing that gave this the juice to work though, 'cause normally a faerie, especially some fucking pixies, would not be able to crack into Santa's sleigh. There's something being invoked here. And hidden within the rune, you recognize something. You don't know what it is or can't read it. It's an infernal rune. You—"
"Misty: [sighs] Well, there's something pretty nasty. You know that religious-- it's one of those religious ones."
Kugrash: Sure.
"Misty: You know what? It's written in seelie, but this is some dark, nasty stuff. Just--"
Kugrash: Some devil shit.
"Misty: Yeah, infernal, nasty hell plane."
"Brennan: Misty, you look at the rune again. You don't read infernal, but you do know who does."
Misty: I think I know who could help us out with this nasty little situation. [frowns at Kugrash] Maybe I'll put you in a blanket and carry you over the rest.
Kugrash: Sure. Yeah.
Misty: Is that OK with you?
Murph: I jump into her arms.
Misty: OK. This was OK. It's fine.
Kugrash: It's like a baby bjorn.
Misty: It's Miu Miu. It's not Prada.
Kugrash: Yeah. Heh.
Misty: It's Miu Miu. It's not Prada.
"Emily: I'm just going through your drawers. I'm like,"
"Sofia: God, this place is so nice."
"Brennan: Incredible. You guys take off. Snow kicks off from Central Park West. We follow the snow through the air as it wends its way, two gusts of snow as Ricky, Kingston, and Pete, and Sofia, Misty, and Kugrash converge on the steps of the public library by Bryant Park. You guys-- there's snow everywhere, taxis-- busy day. It's getting into the mid-afternoon. And you guys spot each other in these two groups of three."
Misty: Kingston! Darling!
"Kugrash: Kingston, how's it going, man?"
"Kingston: Misty, Kugrash, what's going on, guys?"
Sofia: I'm so sorry. Are you Mr. March?
"Ricky: Oh, yes. That's me."
Sofia: Oh my god. The girls at the beauty salon are gonna flip. Can I take a selfie with you?
"Ricky: Yeah, of course."
Sofia snaps a selfie with Ricky and promptly begins to text.
"Kingston: Also, guys, this is Jeffrey. Jeffrey, this is--"
Sofia: Oh my god.
Kugrash: Jeffrey.
Kugrash and Pete: [together] Hey.
Pete: What's up?
Kugrash: Good to meet you. I'm Kugrash.
"Sofia: Oh, my god."
"Kugrash holds out his hand to Pete, who hesitantly takes and shakes it."
Pete: Are you a rat?
"Kugrash: I'm a rat man, yeah."
Pete: I'm sorry if that was rude.
[scary music]
"Brennan: Pete, the mushrooms are done. You're fully so— you know that you're sober. You know that you're sober. The degree to which this is all a fun little trip is fully leaving you, especially after whatever that shot Kingston gave you was. And suddenly, you hear a booming voice to your right go:"
"Booming voice: Well, well, well. Would you wish to enter?"
Brennan: One of the huge stone lions turns and is speaking directly at you guys. You hear a voice to your left.
Stone lion: I think they do wish to enter. [laughs] Hello! Good to see you again.
Kugrash: Hey.
"Misty: If you're going to ask us which one of you lies and which one of you tells the truth, we can skip it. We know."
Stone lion: Both of us always lie.
"Misty: Yes, we know! That's the trick!"
Kingston: Exactly. We're not trying to play these games.
"Stone lion: Oh, let's play some games! We guard the library. We are the guardians of the Gramercy Occult Society. Hello. Ooh, a new face. Hello, I am Orlando and this is my boyfriend, Rovias."
"Pete: OK, look, you guys, this was really nice. But I don't really have time for a puzzle room kind of thing."
Sofia: I do! I love this!
Kingston: All right.
"Ricky: I'm not very good at them, but I can definitely try my hardest, guys."
"Orlando: Welcome, welcome, welcome."
Brennan: You guys see that the two stone lions laugh and are joking with you guys a bit. They go:
"Orlando and Rovias: Well, what business brings you here to the Gramercy Occult Society?"
Kingston: We need to talk to Alejandro.
Orlando and Rovias: Very well. Then talk to him you shall. [louder] Let none bar the entry of these companions!
[sound of stone grinding]
Brennan: And you see that a secret stone door opens at diagonal in the steps of the library going down.
Misty: Can I just say? You've been working on your voices and you sound great.
"Stone lion: You know, that vocal coach came by. We got-- Thank you."
Misty: Really good. Really love it. It's really impress-- just since the last time we spoke. It's great.
Stone lion: It's hard 'cause our diaphragms are made of stone.
Ricky: What did you use to sound like?
Stone lion: Hm?
Ricky: What did you use to sound like?
Stone lion: [raspy voice] We used to sound like this.
Ricky: Awesome.
"Kugrash: Santa Claus is dead, everyone."
Kingston: Let's go.
Pete: What?
"Kugrash: Well, maybe."
"Misty: Oh, well, OK, let's go!"
[curious music playing]
"Brennan: You guys walk down into the Gramercy Occult Society, the New York Public Library. You go down the steps and the steps immediately MC Escher-- so that you're sideways, upside down, going through their doors. And you arrive in an upside down library where the gravity has been reversed. So you know that your heads are pointed away from the sky, but it looks totally normal to you. Huge, tall libraries everywhere, covered in books. And you see that a very old, extremely rotund man walks out."
"He's got a big white mustache, a little flat cap, and comes out to talk to you guys. He has the warmest eyes. Just looks like a extremely gregarious guy, but he's definitely well into his 90's. You see that this is your friend, Alejandro."
"Kingston: Alejandro, what's goin' on, man?"
"Alejandro: [elderly Spanish-accented voice] Oh, Kingston Brown. It is so good to see you again, my friend."
"Kingston: Good to see you as well. Hey, well, we have a situation. My man over here, Jeffrey, got some kind of Santa disease. And I don't know-- what are y'all here for?"
"Misty: Oh, well, uh-- mmm. [gestures to Kugrash]"
Kugrash: Yes. We found Santa's sleigh abandoned.
Kingston: What?
Kugrash: Reindeers gone.
Kingston: What?
Kugrash: Some sort of attack from the pixies—
Ricky: [devastated] No!
Kugrash: I've found some little pixie mixed in— Santa is real. You know that. Yeah. Yeah.
"Misty: Oh, yes. Oh, Santa's real-- is he-- ? How many people here are new?"
Kingston: Who's new?
Pete: What the fuck is going on?
"Sofia: I don't know, but I love it."
"Kingston: Jeffrey, I think is pretty—"
"Ricky: His name is Peter, I think."
Kingston: What?
"Pete: What? What, did you check my bracelet when I was out, man?"
Ricky: Yeah. It was dangling in my face while I was running.
Pete: [quietly] You run so fast.
Brennan: You see—
Kugrash: It said something infernal on it.
Brennan: Alejandro looks at you and says:
Alejandro: Wait a minute. You are being serious? Santa Claus is missing right now?
"Kugrash: Yeah, and somebody left behind some kind of infernal rune."
"Misty: Yeah, I couldn't read it. It's all infernal to me right now."
Brennan: You see he says:
Alejandro: We've been getting some strange reports. Hold on.
Brennan: He touches a bookcase and a shimmering thing of light appears over it. And you see that there are two twin young women. They look about 17-years- old. They are clearly Alejandro's granddaughters. You might recognize them. But you see he says:
"Alejandro: Ana, Amelia, what is wrong?"
Brennan: Because they are clearly injured. You see that the two of them say:
"Ana and Amelia: Grandpa, we're out here fighting. There's-- Something's wrong. These SantaCon clones, they're not like normal. They're really dangerous. A bunch of them are coming. We think they're coming from Times Square."
Sofia: OK. This is the first thing I think I can do to help. I know how to fight.
Kingston: All right.
"Sofia: I don't know what the fuck else is going on, but I can fight."
Brennan: Alejandro looks and says:
"Alejandro: Ana, Amelia, get to safety right now. Hold on."
"Brennan: And you see that all of these little running trains and subway cars of light appear and draw this insane subway map rune in front of Alejandro, and he pushes it past you. And it scans you. And he grabs the light, condenses it in his hand, and says:"
"Alejandro: I'm going to see what is going on. If my granddaughters are in trouble, that means that things have gotten very bad indeed. They are very proficient wizards. All right?"
Brief moment of silence. Pete makes incredulous eye contact.
Alejandro: Wizards.
"Ally: I've been holding my gun this whole time, but in incognito."
Alejandro: What? You think I don't know that you're strapped?
Pete: Mmm?
Alejandro: Give it a shot. See what happen. Why don't you give it a shot?
Ricky: I'm going to ask that you don't do it—
Kugrash: Just fully don't. Fully don't do it.
"Misty: Oh, please do it. I love it when people do this. Go ahead. Oh, I love it."
"Ricky: Hey, Peter? Hey, Peter? Hey, Peter? Put the gun down. Hey, Peter? Put the gun down."
"Pete: Is this a joke, though? Who are you guys working for?"
"Misty: No, no, he can do it."
Ally: Bam!
Brennan: You see a little shield appears in front of him and he says:
Misty: [under her breath] So cool.
"Alejandro: You think I'm going to walk around-- I've been a wizard in New York City for what, 65 years? You think a bullet is going to do the trick?"
Pete: I—
[mysterious music playing]
"Alejandro: Listen to me. You have been awakened into the Unsleeping City. There is a world behind a world. New York is a place of magic. In this realm, the city that never sleeps, the dream world and the waking world commingle, intertwine, and in certain places, become one. I do not know why it has happened. We will find out in due time. But you are now here in the Unsleeping City with all of us. Magic is real, and you better get your fucking shit together or it's going to be a real bad look."
Pete: [whispers] Oh. Epic.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
Alejandro: I will study this. Make your way to Times Square as soon as you can.
Brennan: And he turns around and disappears.
Zac: I just start running to—
"Ricky: Let's go, guys!"
Kugrash: I feel like there's a faster way for us to get there.
Kingston: We don't need to run.
Ricky: Right. Sorry. OK.
Sofia: I'll just chase Mr. March.
"Brennan: You guys head off. You walk out. Kingston, you look out and you see your bus pulls up."
Lou: Fantastic.
Brennan: You see Suzette opens it and says:
"Suzette: Kingston, [confused] you're downtown now."
"Kingston: Yeah. We need to get to Times Square, pronto."
"Brennan: You see, she looks and for a second, she looks like, ""No way"
"is that on my route."" But she says,"
"Suzette: Oh, I got mixed up. I'm on the wrong route. That's right, Times Square, next stop, Times Square. Bing bing!"
"Brennan: And a trafficless street opens up as Kingston gets on the bus. You guys take off. As you pull into Times Square, you see that Times Square is empty."
Ally: [disgusted] Ooh.
Brennan: Covered in snow and ice.
Sofia: This is like The Walking Dead.
"Brennan: In the center is an enormous, icy cocoon. A chrysalis of ice. And you look and see swarming SantaCon clones."
"Mutant Santas: Ho, ho, ho."
"Brennan: The bus pulls away, and I'm gonna need all of you to roll initiative."
[music playing]
"Brennan: That's all for this episode of The Unsleeping City. Tune in next week, and we'll catch you guys then. [Donnie Brasco voice] Forget about it."

"Brennan: Strange, icy fortress and these horrifying mutated Santa clones all going,"
"Mutant Santas: [garbled] Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. Christmas. Christmas."
Lou: This is horrifying.
Ally: What's the worst thing that could happen in a wild magic surge?
Brennan: You kill your entire party.
"Emily: Wait, Kug is down?"
Murph: Everyone's so fucked.
Brennan: The ice scatter.
[cast screaming in horror]
Ally: What the fuck? No!
Murph: Absolutely fuck me.
Ally: Fuck you! Fuck you!
"Kugrash: Santa, are you OK?"

[RECAP]
[Mysterious music plays]
"Brennan: It is a snowy, blustery day, clear skies over [New York accent] the best fucking skyline of any city that has ever been or will ever be. It is New York City, baby."
"Pete: I'm Pete, I am not doing well on the inside."
"Sofia: My name is Sofia Lee. I’m sorry, no, it is Sofia Bicicleta."
"Kugrash: Hey I'm uh, Kugrash. I live in the subway tunnels and I take care of the discarded people of New York."
"Kingston: My name is Kingston Brown. I am a steward of New York City, and I will be here until I die."
"Misty: I'm Misty Moore. I'm a Broadway diva, lover of dance and light and brilliance."
"Ricky: I'm, uh, Ricky Matsui. I'm a firefighter and I'm just here to help."
"Esther: Well, first of all Santa Claus is real."
Ricky: Awesome.
"Esther: Santa Claus clones himself millions and millions of times, and each of those clones goes to the separate houses. (jumpcut) Santa deposits his defective clones here in the city. That is SantaCon."
"Amelia: Something's wrong, these SantaCon clones, they're: they're not like normal, they're really dangerous!"
Alejandro: You have been awakened into the Unsleeping City. Make your way to Times Square as soon as you can.
Brennan: You see the Times Square is empty.
Ally shivers.
"Brennan: In the center is an enormous, icy cocoon. (jumpcut) You look and see swarming Santa Con clones. (growls)"
[END RECAP]
"Upbeat music plays, and there is the intro, which is the words DIMENSION 20, UNSLEEPING CITY over a skyline in a circle that rotates until it is upside down."
Brennan: Hello and welcome back to the unsleeping city! My name is Brennan Lee Mulligan. These are our intrepid heroes. Say hi intrepid heroes!
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Eerie, drum heavy music plays."
"Brennan: I love it. We descend into Times Square! With this strange, icy fortress throbbing with icy blue light, and these horrifying Santa mutant clone monsters surround-"
Ally: Aww!
Emily: Did you try to make the most disgusting thing so they couldn’t call them cuties? (Laughs)
Ally: (Laughs)
Siobhan: (To the tune of Santa Baby) Santa cuties! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo- doo-doo!
"Brennan: For everyone watching at home, for everyone watching at home, the term is corn gremlin, and—"
Emily and Ally laugh
Brennan: Alright guys! I’m gonna go ahead here and clear away some of our lovely Times Square-
Ally: This one has a little candy cane!
Emily: Santa’s little helpers! (laughs) That’s who we’re fighting!
Murph: They have ripped a man apart.
"Brennan: Guys, you guys arrive at the Southern end of this part of Times Square."
Lou: The colored bases is really doing it for me.
Ally: Yeah!
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: We begin! You guys see these horrifying, mutated Santa clones, some with these huge insectoid carapaces, some with tentacles moving around where their arms should be, some of them instead of faces have circular mouths that open up like (shrieks), little animal mandibles, all going—"
Mutant Santa: (distorted) Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Christmas! Christmas!
"Brennan: You guys arrive at the southern end here. You guys see that they bristle and chitter, spines erupt from their skin! Kingston, you are the first to act."
"Lou: Aw man. Can I do like a, can I look at this, this, uh, this shell, uh, thing, and just try and get a read on it of some kind?"
Brennan: Give me an Insight check.
Lou: Alright. Uhh… 12.
"Brennan: It is… throbbing with some kind of energy, there is… something inside of it that is… growing. This is a cocoon."
"Lou: Got it. Uh, fantastic. And then, with the rest of my turn I’ll Bless Kugrash, Ricky, and Sofie."
Sofia: Oh!
"Kugrash: Ayy, thanks man."
"Sofia: Thank you, I don’t-"
Kugrash: Incredibly kind of you.
Sofia: This is way better than communion.
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Brennan: (laughs) Yeah, your subway token glows and the strength of the city fills your bodies. That’s gonna be Ricky Matsui."
"Zac: Um, I look around, I, uh, see them tearing that guy apart, uh, and just have to go in. But I also see that, uh, she seems like she’s about to run in there (gesturing to Emily), so I cast Shield of Faith as a bonus action on, on Sofie. And then try to walk forward and attack the closest one!"
"Brennan: Uh, cool, your speed is thirty so you can move six squares!"
"Zac: (pointing at the board) One, two, three, four, five… six?"
Brennan: Yeah!
Emily: What does Shield of Faith do to my AC?
Zac: You get a plus 2.
Brennan: Raises it plus 2.
"Zac: But it’s a concentration thing. So, I’m just gonna, just take a regular attack at it."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and roll your attack."
"Zac: Uh, that is only 13."
Brennan: Only a 13
"Zac: Oh, I don’t add Bless to that, do I?"
Brennan: You do add Bless to that.
Zac: A d4?
"Lou: Yeah, dude!"
Zac: A 14!
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you hit! Go ahead and roll damage!"
"Lou: (in response to Zac looking through his dice) It’s the, it’s the two pyramids."
Zac: Yeah.
Lou: Two pyramids.
"Zac: Oh. Been a while. Uh, I hit for um, 11."
"Brennan: 11 points of damage, awesome. You run up to that Santa, um, uh, and just, first of all, you like grab Sofie, what do you say as you cast Shield of Faith on Sofie?"
Ricky: Just… promise me you’ll be careful ‘cause you seem like you won’t!
"Sofia: Oh my God. Anything, Mr. March!"
They all laugh.
"Brennan: You take off, (grunts twice) and you see that your axe thuds into that first mutant there, roll an insight check for me."
"Zac: Ooh… a-a 20, not nat."
"Brennan: Some of these Santas look to be a little bit more… sinew-y and tentacle-y? The one that you ran up to is like, thicker, and kind of rockier - has like bone and carapace, and you see that your axe does like, hurt him badly, like thuds into him, but the sort of rocky, crunchy exterior kind of swallows your axe up a little bit as it like (grunts) and then you pull it back out. But you do fuck him up, you do deal some damage to him. Um, that is going to be… the chrysalis. Uh, the chrysalis begins to glow a little bit brighter! Um… and then these mutants."
Brennan moves several of the mutant minis just next to Ricky. Jingle bells ring as they move.
"Kugrash: Ricky, you sweet boy."
Ricky: Please don’t hit me. (laughs)
Lou: (laughs)
"Brennan: You see that that Santa right there does not jump, you see it goes (groans) and (spitting) a burst of plasm comes out of the backside of him and he rockets up onto the roof of that place. Um… (moves a mutant santa mini closer to Ricky and counts to himself)"
Lou: Oh my goodness.
Siobhan: They’re fast!
Kugrash: Fucking douchebags are ruining this city!
Brennan: (continues counting to himself and moving minis)
Zac: Sheesh.
Murph: Moving fast.
Lou: This is horrifying.
"Brennan: Um, they’re closing and you guys see rushing out of the chrysalis three more."
Everyone groans.
Lou: Oh my god.
Murph: [unintelligible] -handle that shit.
"Brennan: One, two-"
Murph: Yikes.
Brennan: And three. They like squirm and pop out of these very small openings in the front of the chrysalis. The ones around Ricky are going to take swings. Um…
Zac: Sheesh.
"Brennan: Ricky, remind me of your armor class one more time?"
Zac: 18.
"Brennan: Uh, that’s going to be… one of them hits you for… uh, for 7 points of damage. (snarls) With his horrifying claw."
Zac: I’m at 23.
"Murph: I think you need to roll to maintain concentration, right?"
Zac: When I get hit?
Murph: Yeah.
Zac: Oh.
Brennan: Go ahead and make that roll.
Zac: 16\.
Murph: So you’re fine.
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Uh, rad, the one up on top of the roof, um… rips open his stomach and goes,"
Mutant Santa: Happy holidays!
"Brennan: And is going to make an attack on Pete, and he goes ahead and deals 6 points of damage to you as a burning hot chunk of coal shoots out of his innards and into your face, and he goes,"
Mutant Santa: You’ve been a bad boy!
"Brennan: Uh, that’s going to be-"
Ally: I’m at 16.
"Brennan: Sofie, that’s you."
"Emily: Okay. Well, I’ve learned a lot today, and um, my brain is working overdrive to process everything so I’ll just do what I do best and get into the fray! Now, I probably have a bit of experience like, assessing my opponents because I’ve been in many schoolyard scraps. Who looks like I wanna go after them? Cause I’m used to going after the big guy. Do I have any kind of sense of like, you’re the biggest threat?"
"Brennan: Uh, they all look pretty slimy and gross to you at the moment."
"Emily: Okay. Alright then, I’m just coming for Mr. March!"
Sofia: I’m coming to save you!
Brennan laughs.
"Ricky: Uh, my name is Ricky, by the way, I just wanna make sure that you’re aware..."
"Sofia: (laughs) Shh, shh! (laughs)"
Ricky: Got it.
"Ally: (laughs, mimicking Ricky) Got it."
Zac: (mimicking like Ally) Got it.
Emily: And I’m gonna attack one of the guys who’s attacking him.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
Emily: Does a 17 hit?
"Brennan: A 17 does hit, yes."
"Emily: Yes, bitch. So that’s gonna be 6, and then with my other elbow, it’s gonna be 3! We’re just gonna leave it at that for now."
"Brennan: Uh, hell yeah, uh, you see… 6 and 3, yeah you run up, pow! Pow! You hit this one as well, um… give me an insight check as well?"
"Emily: Mm, 19! Oh wait, no, it’s gonna be more than that. It’s gonna be 22!"
"Brennan: Um, you run up to one, and I believe yours has a little tentacle there, that you’re hitting, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Uh, yours is a little slimier and squishier, and you hit it with your fist, and you feel that it is hurting it badly. You did deal damage to this thing, but the ones that like Ricky is fighting, look more- even though they’re harder, they’re also more brittle as a result of that. Just, like as you’re fighting them, just a weird thing that occurs to you, cause you hit this guy and he just kind of (burbles) squidges, a little bit. Um, that’s going to be… Pete!"
Ally: Okay. I’m freaking the fuck out. I haven’t slept in four days. Uh… I think I’m trying to channel whatever like that dark voice that took care of my dad was-
Brennan: Mhm
"Ally: Like that button, is it still on my… my bracelet?"
"Brennan: You… yeah, you touch your bracelet, um… and you hear a bunch of voices whispering-"
"Voices: Pete, I wanna help you, let me help, let me help you, let me be the one to help you, who do you want to help you?"
Ally: Okay. Yeah. I invoke that.
"Brennan: Um… awesome! What is Pete sort of thinking at that moment, what does he want to have happen?"
"Ally: I’m like… I need to blow as many of these away as I fucking can. Uh, this day is crazy."
"Brennan: Um, cool, go ahead and if you wanna cast Scorching Ray I think that’s probably gonna surge up, so you roll a spell attack."
Ally: 4\.
Siobhan: Plus-
Murph: Plus your spell attack.
Ally: Which is right…
"Murph: Uh, so you got a 10 on the first one."
"Brennan: A 10 does not hit, but you get two more attacks."
Murph: So you have two more.
"Ally: Oh, I got you, okay, yeah. So… 15?"
Brennan: 15 hits!
Ally: And 12.
Brennan: 12 also hits!
"Ally: Wow, cool cool. Alright great."
"Brennan: So you can either send them at two different people, or you can send them to the same person, you can also, they’re each separate attacks, so you can see what the first attack does, and then decide-"
"Ally: Love it, yeah. Okay, I’ll do that, I’ll see what this first attack-"
"Brennan: Okay, cool, roll 2d6."
Ally: I guess I’ll aim for that guy right in front of me?
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
Ally: Okay… 9.
"Brennan: Uh, 9 damage? Uh, you fucking explode him."
Zac: Nice.
Ally: (whistles)
"Brennan: Um, your fire spell appears to work even better than it nor— it’s like a small amount of fire but it hits him and (mimicking explosion)"
"Ally: Oh, cool."
"Brennan: You, yeah, hold your hand out and you hear behind you, like, uh, this, just these whispers going like-"
"Voices: (whispers) Everyone’s dreamed of burning alive, everyone’s dreamed of burning alive. And now it’s time for you to dream too."
Brennan: And that Santa looks you right in the eyes and goes.
Mutant Santa: No! Have a merry Christmas!
"Brennan: (Mimics explosion) And just explodes, peppermint everywhere, and in a little five feet area around him, peppermint shards fly out in all directions."
Lou: (laughs)
Ally: Okay!
"Kugrash: Hey, good job, kid, you’re really good at this, you’re good at killing people!"
Pete: Thanks.
Kugrash: You’re gonna fit in great here!
Sofia: Yeah!
"Pete: I could kill anyone, honestly-"
"Sofia: Good job, Jeffrey!"
Pete: And I wouldn’t bat an eye.
"Brennan: Misty, that’s gonna be— oh, sorry, you—"
Murph: Second shot.
"Ally: I have one more. I’m gonna go for this guy, kinda in the cluster, also in front of me. Uh, 13."
Brennan mimics an explosion and lifts a mutant Santa mini off the board.
Ally: Sick.
"Brennan: When that happens, he explodes into peppermint, roll me a Dexterity saving throw."
Zac: Yikes.
"Emily: Oh, add Bless!"
"Lou: You’re Blessed, dog."
"Zac: Aw, fuck."
   Brennan: Did you roll a 14?
Lou: Please do not forget that Bless.
"Brennan: Yeah, cool. You’re fine. You only take three points of cold damage as this fucking horrifying mutant erupts in fire and peppermint goes everywhere. (mimics explosion)."
Zac: I’m at 20.
Brennan: That is going to be Misty.
"Siobhan: Um… I would like to do an uh, Investigation or Arcana check on this situation. (gestures to the cocoon)"
"Brennan: Uh, go ahead, roll either one."
"Siobhan: Great, I don’t have good for either of them, but… uh, 16?"
"Brennan: Um, you’re looking at it and you can tell that something inside of that is, again, pupating, is about to come out, and that it’s not only producing these…"
Siobhan: Mhm.
"Brennan:  ...clones here, it is transforming actively within that chrysalis."
Siobhan: Um… I turn to Kingston and say.
"Misty: There’s something in there, we’ve got to get it."
"Kingston: Do you want to go inside, that’s my question."
"Misty: Uh, I’m thinking about it."
Kingston: I’m also thinking about going inside.
Sofia: Let me in!
Pete: Did you guys see how I just lit them on fire!
"Kingston, Kugrash, and Misty talk over each other."
"Kingston: Yeah, you’re magical, you’ll get used to it!"
"Kugrash: Yeah, it was awesome!"
"Misty: It was great, it was great!"
Pete: I didn’t even have to use my gun!
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Misty: Darling, you did great!"
Sofia: That was really cool!
Ricky: Just be careful with that in the future.
"Pete: Okay, yeah, I will thanks… [awkwardly] bro. (To Kingston) Hey, Kingston, he’s really annoying."
Emily: (laughs)
"Kingston: What? Uh, I say we… I’m trying to go inside, I think. (laughs)"
Sofia: Me too.
Siobhan: Uh… so I’m gonna… move as close to… can I take a dash action and get as close to this thing as possible? Maybe this is dumb.
"Brennan: Uh, yeah, you can move 12 squares with a dash action."
"Siobhan: Okay… (counts to 12, moving her mini) I’m gonna just wait here cause a bunch of things are gonna come out of here in a second."
"Brennan: Gotcha. That’s Misty, that is your turn."
Ally: What are your hit points total?
"Siobhan: Uh, 27."
"Ally: Okay, okay, okay."
Brennan: Unless you wanna use a bonus action?
"Siobhan: Uh, oh yes! And I will turn around and say,"
"Misty: By the way, Kingston, as always, that coat looks fabulous on you!"
Siobhan: And I give you Bardic Inspiration. [shining noise]
Lou: Wow.
Emily: Yeah baby!
Ally: Hell yeah!
"Kingston: Thank you, Misty!"
"Brennan: Hell yeah! Kugrash, that’s you baby!"
"Murph: Sweet. I start rushing towards the old cocoon here, (moving his mini) one, two, three, four, five, I have 25 speed, and then I’m going to create a Flaming Sphere and send it (laughs) in."
Ally: Fuck yeah!
"Murph: Cause I have- I make it as an action, within 60 feet, so I’ll do it within like where I can see it, and then as a bonus action I can move it up to 30 feet. So I’ll… (whoosh)"
"Brennan: Uh, hell yes! Do you make an attack roll for that, or is it a saving throw?"
"Murph: The sphere stops if it hits someone, they have to make a Dexterity saving throw if they’re in the way."
Brennan: And you’re sending it up through the channel?
Murph: Yeah I’m just gonna send it in the ‘ol doorway.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Um… go ahead and roll damage for me from the Flaming Sphere.
"Murph: Okay, sweet… I think it’s just 2d6 damage on a failed save, it stops like once it hits one person, so it doesn’t like, go through a bunch of people. 8 damage."
"Brennan: You send it in there, and you guys hear the deepest, most terrifying (mutated roaring) from within there, and the light inside the chrysalis (rumbling) begins to glow."
"Kingston: Kugrash, what’d you do?"
"Kugrash: Yeah, fuck you too, man! Fuckin’ come out of your stupid cocoon, I know you’re not a butterfly! Butterflies are nice!"
"Brennan: (laughs) Yeah, and the thing you sent in there, by the way, like, I imagine Kugrash just whips a dirty rat hand along, and just sparks some of the residual oil in the asphalt, and this nasty trash ball of like oil fire, that’s like, it’s like one of those things where you think of like magical fire and you think of like ‘brilliant! bright!’ this is like, so smoking that you almost can’t see the fire in the middle."
Kugrash: (coughing loudly) Fuck! Ugh!
"Brennan: (laughs) Awesome, that’s gonna go back and be Kingston."
"Lou: I guess I’m gonna chase after these other two, so guess we’ll go… (moving his mini) one, two, three, four, five— can I go through this square?"
"Brennan: If you’re taking a dou- yeah, you can take a double?"
"Lou: Six, seven, eight, nine, okay now I have to stand up, [gets up to reach his mini] ten, eleven, twelve?"
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Lou: Great.
"Brennan: Awesome, that’s gonna be Ricky."
"Zac: Okay, so the one in front of me’s the kind that seemed brittle, and the one to the right of me seemed softer?"
"Brennan: Yes, correct."
"Zac: Okay. I’m just gonna hit the softer one just to see what would happen if I hit it with like, slashing damage."
"Brennan: Cool, go for it, roll an attack."
Zac: Uh… 19?
Brennan: 19 definitely hits.
Zac: Cool.
"Brennan: And are you going for the one that Misty already kinda - yeah, cool, awesome."
Emily: Sofia.
"Brennan: Oh, Sofia."
"Zac: Yes. Doing that one. Where is my d8? Yeah. No. God… Ooh, I hit it for 15."
Brennan: You hit it for 15?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: This thing… looks, and it’s just this gooey, oozing, tentacle, and you see it looks at you and says."
Mutant Santa: Don’t bring that home! [incoherent groaning]
"Brennan: (grunts) And you split it. It explodes, uh, and each of you (pointing at Zac and Emily) need to make a Dexterity saving throw."
Zac: Oh… yeah.
Emily: Okay.
"Zac: Yikes… Um, I only got a 5."
Emily: I got 16!
"Brennan: Uh, you got a 16, you got a 5, you take 4 cold damage, Sofie you take 2. But you see that, yeah, it’s super effective. (mimes swinging axe, grunts) Your axe glows bright and the power of civic responsibility flows through your veins. That guy dead! (deep music plays) Um, then-"
Zac: I forgot they explode.
Emily: (laughs)
"Brennan: Now it’s gonna be these dudes, I’m afraid."
Murph: Oh no.
"Brennan: Uh, you feel something in there battering its way out, trying to, like (banging), hatch out of this chrysalis."
"Kugrash: Ay, don’t do it, buddy, it’s fine! Stay asleep!"
"Kingston: Kugrash, stop yelling at it!"
Murph: He’s just speaking in bug. (Bug sounds)
All laugh.
"[tense, wintery-sounding music]"
"Brennan: You see these fuckin’ mutants… (moving minis) This guy comes here, this guy is gonna take a little step over here, this guy goes over here. This guy… here… uh… This one is going to… go here."
"Emily: Oh, Kugrash…"
Kugrash is in the middle of a lot of Santas.
Brennan: Okay. Um… but you see that no other Santas come out of the chrysalis now that the fire’s in there.
Kugrash: Dope!
Ricky: Right.
"Brennan: And this guy is gonna fly down and fuck with our boy Pete. Cool! Pete, go ahead and made a Dex saving throw for me."
Ally: 5.
"Brennan: (laughs) Um… cool. Uh, you go ahead and take… uh, 5 points of cold damage. Um… I am going to need uh, oof, this is gonna be brutal. I’m gonna need Kugrash to make two Dexterity saving throws."
Murph: Oy… okay.
Emily: Remember you’re Blessed!
Lou: You’re Blessed.
Murph: I am Blessed. okay. I have pretty good Dex… Nat 20! Hell yeah!
All cheering.
"Brennan: Cool, and roll me another one."
"Murph: Watch me roll a one on the second one. [groans] Oh, but I gotta roll Bless… um, 10 is the second one."
Brennan: 10 is exactly what you needed.
Emily: Woo!
"Murph: Ugh, thank goodness."
"Brennan: The first one you take no damage from, the second one you only take three points of cold damage, I’ll describe what’s happening in a moment, I’m gonna need Sofie to make 3 Dexterity saving throws."
"Zac: Sheesh, 3?"
Brennan: Mhm.
Lou: Disgusting. Whatever’s happening right now is disgusting.
Siobhan: Gross.
Emily: First one is gonna be… 25.
Brennan: Success.
Ally: Wow.
"Emily: I’m a Dextrous bitch. Ugh, nat 1!"
Lou: Ones on ones.
Ally: Ugh.
"Emily: Yeah, two ones, so that’s gonna be an 8. And the other one is gonna be an 18."
"Brennan: 18, cool. You take… Jesus…"
Ally: Oh no.
"Emily: Jesus like whoa, I got all ones?"
"Brennan: No, very low, you only take 7 points of cold damage."
Emily: Yeah! I still feel good.
"Brennan: Ricky, I’m gonna need you to make one, two, three, four, five Dexterity saving throws."
Ally: Ricky!
Siobhan: God.
Zac: Come on… that’s too many!
Emily: Remember you’re Blessed.
Lou: How does this math work out?
"Siobhan: You definitely Blessed the right people, cause we’re all making…"
"Zac: 8, for the first one?"
Brennan: Failure.
Zac: (sighs) 8 for the second one.
Lou: Why can’t I Bless better?
"Emily: Oh, that’s gonna save…."
   Zac: 18 for the third one. A nat 20!
Ally: Hey!
Brennan: No damage.
Zac: And then… that’s just 12.
Brennan: Okay. I will need Kingston and Misty to each make two saving throws as well.
Lou: Dexterity?
"Brennan: Yes, Dexterity."
Lou: Hoo.
Siobhan: Crap.
"Lou: Uhh, 11 first."
"Brennan: Um, Ricky takes 12 points of cold damage."
"Zac: Ok, I’m at 4."
Lou: 11 and 15.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I got an 8 and a 24."
"Brennan: Kingston, you take 4 points of cold damage, um, uh and Misty you take, uh, 7 points of cold damage. You guys see that all these: the thing inside here screams, all of the mutant Santa clones go,"
Mutant Santas: (roar Holy Night)
Soft Christmas music starts playing.
"Brennan: And pull their mouths open, and go (roars), and a torrent of razor sharp peppermint spines as they all Breath Weapon all over you guys at the same time. Shredding your bodies with like, cold and peppermint, uh, and the smell of, like pine and mint and bile and shit is mixed into the air together."
"Kugrash: It’s fine, it’s fine."
Sofia: Oh my god.
"Kugrash: It’s fucking New York, what do you expect?"
All laugh.
Kingston: Kugrash!
"Kugrash: It’s fucking mint in there, it’s fine!"
Kingston: Kugrash please.
"Misty: The New York that I live in and the New York that you live in are very different, my friend."
"Kugrash: You know, same place."
Brennan: Uhh… incredible. That’s going to be…
"Murph: Oh, I actually have to roll to maintain concentration, cause I got my Flaming Sphere, too…"
"Zac: Oh, I do too."
"Brennan: Oh yeah, you do as well, yup."
Lou: Do I also need to?
Brennan: So you-
Emily: Sweet!
"Zac: Uh, I got a 20."
"Brennan: Cool, sweet."
"Murph: I got… I don’t think I did it, I didn’t do it, I only got a 9."
Brennan: Yup.
Murph: Flaming Sphere’s gone.
Brennan: Flaming Sphere’s gone!
Lou: Do I have to do it for Bless?
"Brennan: Yes, you do - a Constitution check."
Lou: For a Constitution I do not.
"Brennan: The Bless disappears as you guys are (exploding noises) uh, eviscerated by…"
"Emily: Bless disappears, okay."
"Brennan: This peppermint storm, yeah. That’s gonna be Sofie."
Emily: Okay.
(Intense adventure music swells and begins to play)
"Emily: I am done wasting my time with henchmen. I’m going after that chrysalis, and I’m gonna use a ki point to dash so that I can run over here and into here, I’ll take their attacks of opportunity."
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: Confident. I will take their attacks…
Brennan: They miss you. [rushing wind noises] So you take a dash…
"   Emily: So I took my dash, I wanna slide in here…"
Brennan: Uh…
Zac: Into that hole?
"Emily: Like, home plate style."
"Brennan: So go ahead and give me an Acrobatics check. You also see by the way, and I’ll throw this at you as you’re running towards it. Because of the fire, and because of the thing inside battering its way out, you also see that the structure of this also looks incredibly weak right now, just throw that out there. But, if you wanna slide in, you’re totally welcome to."
Emily: I wanna slide in and attack whatever’s in there.
Brennan: Absolutely.
Emily: While it’s trying to form itself.
Brennan: Awesome.
Emily: So Acrobatics?      Brennan: Cool.
Emily: I got an 11 (laughs)
Brennan: You slide in and the ice tunnel closes on you and you’re not able to slide all the way into the tunnel.
"[music stops, crumbling noises]"
Emily: Shit! Fuck!
"Brennan: Uh… but! You have an action left! So there’s a bo— you did your movement, you did a bonus action dash, so you have an action left if you want."
Emily: Can I just heave that shit off me?
Brennan: Yeah! You can either do Athletics or a saving throw.
Emily: I’ll do Athletics.
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: 19\.
"Brennan: You, trapped under here, go to lift and as you are going there, you hear a voice somewhere deep inside you go…"
Voice: (whispers) It is what it is.
"(soft, chiming piano music starts playing)"
Brennan: (Whooshes). You fling the entire chrysalis off into...
Emily: What?! (laughs)
Brennan: Into the sky. You feel a power in your body and a sense of purpose that you honestly haven’t felt in a long time. And you guys watch the ice scatter and the dome fly off into the sky.
"Brennan lifts the ice dome to reveal a colossal mutant Santa mini, with an alien spine, a long, slug body and several crab-like claws, with a tiny hat on top. The entire cast shouts in fear."
Murph: Is that Santa?!
Emily: Santa!
Ally: Santa!
"Murph: Oh, wait no, Santa’s down there."
It pans to the mini of the real Santa lying prone beside the monster.
Murph: Ugh. Is Santa dead?
"Ally: Right, that’s little Santa down there. What the fuck, no, fuck you!"
"Kugrash: Absolutely fuck me. Santa, are you okay? Santa!"
Siobhan: Cronenberg Santa is fucking ugly.
Brennan: Hey. Honestly guys? [raises his mug] More like ‘Miracle on 42nd Street’. Whoo!
Emily: (laughs)
Lou: Jesus.
Zac: Aggh!
"Lou: Also, we just watched a drunk woman flip a giant ice cocoon?"
"Brennan: Just up into the sky, it shatters against one of the buildings, and (exploding) turns into snow."
"Siobhan: I turn to Kingston and say like,"
Misty: Just like old times!
"Kingston: I mean, I’ll tell you."
"Sofia: Hey, did anyone see that?"
"Misty: Yeah, it was cool, I liked it!"
"Pete: Yeah, we all saw it."
Misty: It was very good!
Sofia: Thank you.
"Brennan: Pete, that’s gonna be you."
Lou: Jesus Christ.
Kugrash: Santa’s my friend and he’s fucking dead. Or very hurt. He looks awful.
Ally: Okay. Can I run up onto this?
"Brennan: Um… yes, you can use magic to do - if you have magic you can do that or you can make an Acrobatics check to get up on there?"
Ally: Yeah I’ll do that.
Brennan: Give me an Acrobatics check?
"Murph: Ally, you are a bad roller."
Ally: Five.
Siobhan: The tables…
Ally: The Acrobatics… What is that? What do I add to that?
Brennan: Just your Acrobatics.
"Murph: It’ll just be your Aex, unless you have, so 3. So 8."
Ally: 8.
"Brennan: You go to climb up on here, also this Santa’s gonna get an attack of opportunity on there."
Ally: Is there one?
"Brennan: There’s one, yeah, with you."
"Ally: Oh, yeah yeah yeah."
"Brennan: Um, definitely hits for… (laughs) and deals you uh, 5 points of damage with a claw (roars) as you rush past, um, and you start to try to clamber up, and you hear a voice in your head say."
"Voice: (whispers) Anything is possible, anything is, anything is possible."
"Brennan: And you… you can’t get up. You’re like scrambling to try to get up, uh, you feel the weird rising sense in your stomach, um, also one thing we forgot to do last round, was to roll for Wild Magic Surge, please go ahead and roll for Wild Magic Surge now."
Ally: Oh yeah. 17.
"Brennan: 17, uh we’re also gonna be doing a homebrew roll with your wild magic, which is that every time you don’t Wild Magic Surge, the chance of you wild magic surging goes up by 1."
"Ally: Okay, so I have to roll twice."
"Brennan: Or rather, you roll the same time, but now on a 1 or 2 you surge."
"Ally: Oh, okay, it grows."
"Brennan: So the longer, it grows, it like builds up. You can’t make it up there, but you do have your action left."
"Ally: Great, great, yeah, yeah, so I’m going to get back in touch with that darkness because it felt like it was like helping me, and these new friends, so I’m gonna try and attack this like, big daddy?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it!"
Ally: Can I reach that with 120?
"Brennan: 120 feet, yes, you can definitely do."
"Ally: I’m gonna do Scorching Ray, but this time I’m gonna use a Sorcery Point to do one more, so instead of three people I can do four."
"Brennan: Oh, is that one of the powers you have with Sorcery Points?"
"Ally: Yeah, Sorcery-I guess I can use a point per level of the spell to add, like, a uh, an extra thing to it, or an extra uh…"
Brennan: Oh! What’s the name of that ability?
Ally: I think it’s just something I can use for Sorcery Points.
"Brennan: For Sorcery Points. Okay… I’m not seeing… In order to do extra damage, or are you doing Sorcery Points to do an extra spell slot?"
Ally: It would be using a Sorcery Point to pick an extra person to attack.
"Brennan: Oh, you just get one more ray with that?"
Ally: I think so.
Brennan: Okay.
"Ally: But I could be wrong, I’m down to check it."
"Brennan: You know what? I’m down. You could take another ray with a Sorcery Point, we’ll figure it out later."
"Ally: Okay. (gestures to Murph) Does that sound…?      Murph: I think it might just be spell slots, but I haven’t played a-"
"Brennan: I think it’s just spell slots. If you want to use two— both your Sorcery Points to add another ray, I’ll house rule that we can do that this time. Um… uh, cool, go ahead and roll your four attacks."
Ally: Cool. 11.
"Murph: Uh, plus your…"
"Ally: Oh, right."
"(Chiming, eerie music starts playing)"
Murph: 17.
"Ally: Oh, so 17."
Brennan: That hits.
"Ally: 19 plus 6, 25."
Brennan: That hits.
Ally: 21\. And 9.
"Brennan: Uh, roll damage for your first 3 attacks."
Ally: Cool… these are d6s.
Brennan: Mhm.
Ally: Can I borrow?
Murph: Yeah… you need one more?
"Ally: Yeah, one more."
Murph: There you go.
"Lou: Look at those d6s going, get ‘em going, get ‘em hot."
"Siobhan: Oh my goodness, so chunky."
Lou: Get ‘em hot. Oh!eeeeeee
Siobhan: Nice!
Murph: Oh-it looks good!
"Ally: Yeah! 10, 18, uh 23!"
Brennan: Hell yeah!
Lou: All on big daddy?
Ally: All on big daddy.
"Brennan: Pete, go ahead and tell me, you reach out to the voice, and the voice in the darkness goes…"
Voice: (whispers) It is right to wish for power.
"Brennan: Uh… what happens as Pete raises his hand, you feel this is powerful magic."
"Ally: Yeah, I feel, I do feel like it’s evil (laughs) but I’m like, I have always been someone who lives in the night and maybe that’s just me now. So… (laughs) I’m like,"
Pete: Thank you.
Ally: And then I attack.
"Brennan: (explosion noise) Your, the flesh and bone of your arm explodes out like a banana peeling apart, going (screams) and a torrent of flame shoots out and you see that the flame is filled with these little beaked goblins or something, made of fire going like."
"Goblins: Yay, we’re all coming!"
"Brennan: (Explosion sound) as they shoot out (machine gun noise) and rend the chest of this giant santa thing, uh, and your arm (growls) starts to like, stitch itself back together. You feel insane and like, high. This is awesome. Go ahead and roll another Wild Magic Surge for me."
Ally: [sighs] 17\.
Brennan: You’re good!
Ally: (laughs) What’s the worst thing that could happen in a Wild Magic Surge?
"Brennan: Uh, you could kill your entire party."
Nervous laughter from some of the cast.
Emily: I’m here for it. I’m here for the gamble.
Siobhan: Hell yeah. We support you killing us all with your wild magic.
"Brennan: That’s going to be, that’s going to be-"
Ally: Very cool.
Brennan: Misty.
"Siobhan: I would like to take a five foot step back, I can take a five foot step back without getting an attack of opportunity, right?"
Brennan: Five foot step is actually a…
"Siobhan: Oh, that’s a 3.5 thing?"
Brennan: 3.5...
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: As long as you don’t leave the threatened area, you’re fine."
"Siobhan: So, I would like to cast, uh, Faerie Fire, which is a first level spell on this little monster guy and he has to, um, win a, he has to beat a Dexterity saving throw and if he does not beat the Dex throw he— we gain advantage on all attacks against him."
Brennan: Really?
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: Ooh, that seems extremely…"
Siobhan: I’ll read it out to you if you like.
"Brennan: No that’s, that’s great. So he has to roll a Dex save, what’s the DC for your spells?"
"Siobhan: Uh, DC is 14."
"Brennan: Ooh boy! You know what? It’s the first battle, let’s bring out our old friend the Box of Doom."
(Intense music kicks up)
Lou: Mm.
Ally: Ooh!
Emily: Ooh-hoo-hoo!
"Brennan: Once again, bringing out our old friend, The Box of Doom, for important rolls here! Our friends are in the middle of a frozen Times Square, fighting these horrifying Santas, and their (garbled low voice) giant hive queen Santa Claus has just appeared. (Normal voice) We are now going to roll, because that Santa is gonna make a little old saving throw. Uh, tell you right now that this Santa makes that throw on a 13 or higher. To see if this spell affects it. We’ll go ahead and roll… It rolled a 5. Uh…"
Siobhan gives the box double middle fingers.
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: Misty, what does your spell look like as you cast it?"
"Siobhan: (fantasy harp music plays) A beautiful, sparkly, almost like disney- princess-esque, uh, circle of lights enshroud him, um, and like, ding off of him in little like, plinky bells."
"Brennan: (dinging, then roaring)"
Emily: (laughs)
Mutant Santa: Very naughty.
"Misty: Darling, I love to be naughty. It’s my favorite thing!"
"Brennan: (laughs) Uh, incredible. Uh, Kugrash, that’s gonna be you."
Murph: Sweet. Oh boy. Everyone’s so fucked. Um… okay.
"Kugrash: Kingston. You got uh, you got our friend Ricky here?"
Kingston: I think I’mma head back for Ricky in a second.
Kugrash: Okay.
"Murph: Then I’m gonna, I guess I’m gonna create another Flaming Sphere and shoot it at him. That’ll be my last 2nd level spell, but I’m gonna do that."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Uh, go ahead and this guy’s gonna make a save, what’s your DC on that?"
"Murph: Uh, my DC is… 14."
"Brennan: Um, awesome, go ahead and roll damage."
Murph: Cool. 10.
Emily: Yeah!
Brennan: Yeah.
Murph: And then I’m just gonna have it chill up in his shit.
"Brennan: Um, you see that it (roars). This garbage-y, oily fireball (garbles) um, attacks this giant monster, Kingston, that’s you."
"Lou: Um, can I, uh, what’s the state of Santa?"
"Brennan: Uh, you look down, uh, make a Medicine check for me."
Lou: Ho-ho.
"Kugrash: Is he all right, Kingston, is he okay?"
Zac: What is the state of Santa?
"Lou: Uh, that’s gonna be 28."
Ally: Whoo!
"Brennan: Uh, Santa is badly injured."
Lou: Mhm.
Brennan: But still breathing.
"Lou: Okay. Right. Uh… I think of my old friend Santa, but, uh, I notice how awfully hurt Ricky Matsui is right now, so—"
Zac: I can heal myself.
"Lou: To what extent, though?"
"Zac: I have a Cure Wounds, and I have Lay On Hands."
Lou: Still!
"Zac: If you felt like healing Santa, heal Santa."
Lou: (sighs) I kinda wanna heal Santa.
"Misty: You gotta do it, heal Santa!"
"Kingston: But I, Ricky, I—"
"Misty: He can take care of himself, he’s a big, strong boy!"
"Lou: Fine, I heal Santa."
(All laugh)
"Lou: I think I’ll do Healing Word, so I don’t have to get all up in the juices with, uh, the hive queen."
"Ally: Ugh, don’t talk about the juices."
"Brennan: Okay, so, you’re gonna bonus action Healing Word, awesome."
"Siobhan: Oh, I forgot to do my bonus action… [taps her forehead]"
"Ally: [to Siobhan] What was it, a Bardic?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Lou: Uh… let’s see… what is that? So, do I just roll d4 plus my spellcasting modifier?"
"Brennan: Um, yes, you do."
"Lou: Great. Uh, that’s gonna be 8."
Brennan: Um…
Emily: Santa!
Brennan: What do you say to Santa?
Kingston: [yelling] Santa! Get your ass up!
Santa: (gasps) Merry Christmas! (grunts)
Brennan: And you see that he vomits a bunch of peppermint eggs out of his… (mimics vomiting)
(Whole cast groans)
"Santa: Oh, it laid eggs in me! It laid eggs in Jolly Old Saint Nick!"
Murph: (groans)
Emily: Oh my God.
"Brennan: Santa begins to, like, crawl to his feet. That's your bonus action. You have movement and action left."
"Lou: I guess I'll move toward Ricky Matsui, just in case I know Ricky I-"
"Kingston: Boy, I know you could take care of yourself, but."
"Brennan: And you have an action, so you could do a disengage to not get attacks of opportunity."
"Lou: Great, I'll do a disengage and not get attacks of opportunity."
Brennan: Kingston rushes back over to Ricky. Then that's going to be Ricky.
"Zac: Okay, I might-I don't-they're gonna go before you get a chance to heal me."
"Lou: Yes, good."
"Zac: So, I think I gotta heal myself first. So, I'm gonna do Cure Wounds on myself."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Damn, so my spellcasting ability modifier is just 1, right?"
Brennan: Mhm.
"Zac: Okay, so I heal myself, for 4. [heavenly-sounding chime]"
Lou: Glad I came back.
Brennan: What’s your Charisma? Your Charisma is 3.
Zac: My Charisma is 3.
Brennan: So it heals you for 6. Charisma is your spellcasting modifier.
"Zac: Gotcha, so I heal for 6. I'm at 10 now and then, I don't really have anything else to do other than, I guess I could try to move forward towards the thing, but they're gonna get a hit on me right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, they would."
"[tense, orchestral music]"
"Zac: Yeah, I think I probably shouldn't get that way. So, I'm gonna try to move (counting spaces) one, two, three, four, three, four, five, six."
"Brennan: Cool, so two of them will get swings on you."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: So you're moving right here? Great.
Zac: Eighteen is my AC.
"Brennan: Two swings on you, 18’s the AC. That's two misses, baby."
Emily: Woo! Let’s go misses.
Ally: That’s a high AC.
"Brennan: Yeah, you rushed - you're so fucking buff, these goopy Santa Clauses. Just muscle your way through. Then it's going to be [roars, holding the giant mutant Santa] This thing picks up Santa."
Lou: No.
Brennan: In one of its claws.
Ally groans.
Siobhan: It’s so drippy.
Ally: Are those bodies?
"Siobhan: Oh, yeah they're bodies."
Emily: They are.
Lou: Is that a pregnant woman?
Siobhan: No!
Ally: Jesus Christ!
Zac: Dark.
"Murph: Oh, so he fucking moves."
Emily: You fucker.
Brennan: Comes over here.
Ally: Trying to get the Dunkin Donuts. It's in the DD perks.
Brennan: I'm gonna need Dexterity saves from Ricky and from Misty.
Ally: Fuck!
Zac: 13.
Siobhan: 11.
Brennan: Who got a 13?
Zac: I did.
"Brennan: You did, okay. One second..."
Zac: Is 13 the worse one?
Siobhan: Unlucky 13.
Brennan: Misty you take 16 points of damage—
"Siobhan: Jesus, Christmas."
Brennan: —and you (points at Zac) take 8 points of damage.
Zac: Alright I'm at 2.
Siobhan: I'm at 4.
"Brennan: You see that Santa goes (growls) and just the coldest shards of tinsel— just tinsel vomit— [groaning] lacerate and shred you guys with this freezing cold energy. And then, the mutants go. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
Siobhan: I’m gonna be down.
Zac: I mean...
"Ally: It's you two who can bring people back, right?"
Lou: Yeah.
"Murph: Yeah, I can heal people."
Emily: You have heals too?
Siobhan: I have a heal.
Emily: I don't think I have any kind of heal.
"Lou: Hey, then go kick ass dude, leave that to us."
"Emily: I know, I feel bad though, I always play healers. I don’t know how to not heal."
"Siobhan: Heal yourself, man."
Emily: That’s true.
Lou: I’m at 21.
Siobhan: Let other people heal you.
"Brennan: Okay, Kingston, what's your armor class?"
Lou: 18.
Siobhan: Dang.
Brennan: You take 5 points of damage.
"Lou: Whoo, okay."
Brennan: From a slashing— [roars] one of the tentacles tackles rips at you.
"Lou: 21 minus 5, which is.."
Brennan: Kugrash what's your AC?
Murph: 17\. I got a little shield.
Brennan: You take 8 points of damage.
Murph: [whispering] Fuck.
Emily: What are you at?
Murph: 10 and I have to roll to maintain concentration to keep my sphere.
Kugrash: Absolutely fuck me.
Murph: I don't do it.
"Brennan: Pete, what's your armor class?"
Ally: 13.
Brennan: You take 4 points of damage.
Ally: Down to 2.
Brennan: And then that's gonna be Misty and Ricky. That's a miss on Ricky and a miss on Misty.
"Siobhan: Do I have to— for concentration, he hit me for 16. What do I, is my, that spell is gone, right?"
Brennan: Faerie Fire?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: You could theoretically roll... is it-it's a Constitution saving throw.
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: So, you should roll a saving throw to see. Half damage is 8."
Siobhan: Fuck!
"Brennan: The spell, [psssh]."
"Siobhan: Yeah, so no advantage over him whatsoever. God fucking damnit."
"Emily: Damn, these saving throws are fucking us."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: That's going to be now-those were all the mutants that went. You see that Santa-
Lou: Come on Santa.
Brennan: Santa from within the claws of that thing goes
"Santa: Well, I'm very very sorry. You deserve better than this, especially during this holiday season. But, let's see what else I can do."
"Brennan: And you see that he reaches into his bag, which he's still got."
Zac: Presents!
Emily: Yay!
Lou: He just gives us a PS4 and that's it.
Emily: But it's a one D12 weapon.
"Murph: Ricky catches it but it still breaks, from the jostling."
[gentle chiming music]
Brennan: You see he reaches in and takes a little bit of snow and goes (mimics blowing snow from his hand). Every single one of you gains 8 hit points.
Emily: Ooh!
"Lou: Okay, Santa!"
Misty: Thank you Santa.
Sofia: Thank you Santa!
Santa: We wish you a Merry Christmas! Ho ho ho!
"Sofia: Even in these times, he’s laughing."
Santa: Ahh! It's crushing me!
Emily: Oops! I did it wrong.
Lou: Back up to 24.
Zac: I’m at 10.
"Ally: Yeah, same."
Brennan: Waking up Santa was the right move. That's gonna be Sofie.
"Emily: Okay, I would like to run, jump up on this exposed rib, and use it to monkey bar myself to uppercut him with my feet. I wanna concuss this fuck."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, you make it there! You got a speed of 40, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and roll your attacks."
"Emily: Okay, is 18 gonna hit?"
Brennan: 18 hits.
"Emily: Okay, so that's for 7, then I'm going to hit him again. Does 16 hit?"
Brennan: 16 hits.
"Emily: For 5 then I'm gonna use— so it's 7, 5. I'm gonna use a ki point for a Flurry of Blows. Do I have to roll— no I— do I have to roll again?"
"Brennan: You just have to roll an attack, yeah."
"Emily: Roll an attack again, okay. 17 is gonna hit. And so for another 5."
Murph: Nice.
[crosstalk]
"Brennan: Jesus Christ. After flipping this fucking chrysalis into the sky, you guys see— Sofie is fast. Runs up, you flip—"
"Emily: Can we say I did like the gymnast thing where I like, do a circle on the exposed rib? [spins her fingers in a circle]"
"Brennan: Yeah, like this off balance hive queen wobbles around and (growls). You jump up and get in the ribcage and you kick this motherfucker right in his peppermint heart (groans), and he vomits a bunch of viscous half-formed presents. Like weird organic, like, bows and ribbons and shit come out of his mouth. Incredible. Yeah, you are now deep in this dude's ribcage. You see that Santa looks to you and says,"
"Santa: Sofie Bicicleta, it's wonderful to see you!"
Sofia: Oh my god! Was it really you who I used to go visit at the Staten Island mall?
"Santa: [laughs] No, that was an alcoholic vagrant. I'm Santa Claus. That man got a seasonal job because it's a, you know, that's sort of what he can handle."
"Sofia: I see, well he was really nice. Make sure you give him a good present."
Santa: I always do.
Sofia: Okay.
"Brennan: You are, yeah you're inside that giant Santa Claus. That's gonna be Pete."
"Ally: Fuck! Um, okay. Someone's in front of me, right?"
"Zac: They'll get a hit on you if you move, right?"
"Ally: Yeah, and I don't really have these level spells left. All I have is Fire Bolts."
Zac: And I guess they explode still.
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: You've used your second level spells, right?"
"Ally: Yeah, yeah yeah. Cool, so wait can I— do you think Sleep would affect these people, or?"
Brennan: You could make a— make an Arcana check to see.
Ally: 14.
"Brennan: The powers you've been drawing on are starting to make you feel a little bad. You do feel like another part of you sort of coming on, there’s like something else you can reach out to. If you wanted to try and cast Sleep, you definitely could."
"Ally: Cool, yeah. Um, yeah."
"Brennan: Hell yeah! You go ahead and cast Sleep, so go ahead and roll-I think it's, what, it’s 5d8."
Ally: Yeah.
Murph: And that's how much HP— who are you doing it on?
Ally: What would make most sense?
Murph: Probably the little guys just to take them out.
Lou: Is that concentration?
"Ally: Yeah, so we can stop dealing with them. Okay, I've got 4d8. Great, 12 and then 15."
"Brennan: 15 altogether? Hell yeah. You go ahead, this guy right here you (whoosh) hit this area and this guy goes to sleep. As you hit that group of them you see that-a different voice. You suddenly see a flash of that little gray-faced child. And you see the child says,"
Child: (whispers) I’m trying to reach you but I can’t.
"Brennan: And weird gray gritty city dust— it looks like the kind of dust that kicks off out of the weird gutters and sidewalks that would then, like, hit you in the eye. But also mixed with like little pieces of diamond and, like, glittering starlight appears in your hands. And (whoosh) escapes and hits that guy in his weird oculus. And he goes,"
"Santa Clone: (yawns and falls face down, voice distorted) Visions of sugar plums dance in my head."
Brennan: And is snoozing. That's gonna be Misty.
"Siobhan: I turn to the big boy and I say,"
"Misty: Hey big boy, let's dance."
"[quick, jazzy swing music]"
"Siobhan: And I do an incredible-ly fast, like time step with my beautiful silver shoes of Titania, and I cast Irresistible Dance on the big boy."
Sofia: Can't believe I'm getting a free Misty Moore show. Oh my god.
"Misty: Darling, with me everyday is a show! My life is a show!"
"Brennan: So, you see that this thing looks at you and goes (groans which turns into a distorted song) it has no legs, but just sort of squirms and, like it poops out a couple half formed Santa clones."
"Misty: [dancing] Okay, that’s terrible, I’m sorry I did that."
Brennan: That's now going to be.
"Siobhan: Oh, and I— before I do that, sorry, I um, I go to Sofie and I go,"
"Misty: Hey kid, I like you, you're great."
Siobhan: And I give you Bardic Inspiration.
Sofie: Oh my God! Oh my god! My new friends are awesome!
Ally: Awww.
Brennan: That's going to be Kagrush.
"Murph: Sweet, okay I'm gonna do something a little risky here, [Kug voice] cause I'm a fucking rat. [normal] And I'm gonna just take hits from these guys maybe to get up to here. I wanna get in the middle of my friends here within a 30 foot aura."
"Brennan: Dope, cool, go for it."
Murph: Unless I get struck down. I'm at 18 right now.
Brennan: One of them really clobbers you.
Murph: Fuck!
Brennan: For 14 points of damage.
Murph: Ugh! I’m at 4!
Brennan: But you do get to that spot.
"Murph: Okay, then I am going to— I'm a Circle of Shepherd druid. I'm going to call upon a Spirit Totem of a unicorn. Just, my other ones are real shitty, but this one is an actual majestic unicorn and everyone in a 30 foot aura anytime I cast a healing spell they get healed for my druid level. So, they'll get healed for 3."
"Emily: Ooh, that’s nice."
"Murph: Actually, you know what, I can only cast Cure Wounds on myself because I can't touch anybody else."
"Siobhan: Well, but you need to do that anyway, so that’s."
Emily: But everyone’s gonna get that heal though.
Zac: Can you do both in the same turn?
"Murph: Oh, it's a bonus action to call the Spirit Totem."
Lou: So we all get 3?
"Brennan: You guys see this incredible unicorn appears, made of snow. You guys recognize this is the Inwood unicorn."
"Unicorn: (whinnies) Hey, this fuckin’ guy!"
"Kugrash: Hey, how you doing?"
Brennan: [whinnies] Beautiful snowy mane.
"Murph: I rub his face, get mud all over it."
Brennan: Hell yeah. And then you can heal yourself.
Murph: It's not for much. I just healed myself for 6.
"Brennan: Kingston, it's gonna be your turn."
Zac: So we’re at 13 now?
"Murph: Oh and then you guys— and then Misty, Ricky, Kingston each get 3."
"Lou: So, Pete you're at 10?"
Ally: Mhm.
Lou: Pete's at 10 and in the corner by himself.
"Ally: But the person in front of me is asleep, but still yeah, there are two guys right here."
Zac: I think it’s this guy right here.
"Lou: No, this other guy fell asleep."
Brennan: Yeah you've got— you still have a guy next to you.
Lou: You're still-
Ally: The guy in front of me isn't the one who got attacked?
"Brennan: You didn't roll high enough to make that dude in front of you, who's uninjured, go to sleep."
Ally: Fuck.
Lou: Kugrash you're at?
Murph: I'm at 10.
Emily: Kug!
Lou: 10\. Ricky you're at?
Zac: 13.
"Lou: 13\. And if I move out of this— this like trifecta of dirty Santas I've found myself in,"
Emily: [laughing] Dirty Santa!
Lou: They'll all get attacks of opportunity on me unless I disengage?
Brennan: Correct.
Lou: Okay.
Ally: Let’s all watch dirty Santa together.
Siobhan: So many Billy Bob Thorntons in one day.
"Lou: I think I'm gonna disengage. (counting spaces) One, two, three, four, five. Yeah, can I disengage from these three, move one, two, three, like"
over near the sleeping Santa and then cast Healing Word on Pete the Plug?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Lou: Great.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll that 1d4.
"Lou: Oh, lovely. Plus— okay, that's 9."
"Ally: (sighs) Thank you, man."
Emily: That's good.
Ally: I forgot to roll for Sleep.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll. Is that a nat 1?
Ally and Murph both look up and nod at Brennan.
Siobhan: Fuck.
Zac: For Sleep?
Emily: But maybe it'll be something good.
Murph: Healing surge.
Siobhan: It could be something good. Or a plant could grow next to you.
Zac: It’s a Wild Magic Surge?
Murph: Wild Magic Surge.
"Siobhan: Oh my goodness, happened already."
"Brennan: Very exciting, our first Wild Magic Surge."
"Ally: I was trying to be honest, but I didn't wanna be that honest."
Emily: But maybe it’ll be something really good though that’ll help us.
Murph: Sometimes it’s fun.
"Ally: Yeah, true."
"Brennan: You feel yourself as you get healed by Kingston, your two types of magic interact again of this— again this like golden light mixed with your insane, like, rainbow of [waving his hands around]. You get hit and all of your Sorcery Points are restored."
(Cheering)
"Emily: Yeah, buddy!"
Ally: Okay.
Siobhan: That’s dope.
Emily: Being unstable’s good.
Brennan: This is like the most insane upper you've ever been on. You are fucking cooking right now.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: Now, we're going to— that was Kingston, Ricky that is you."
Zac: How fucked up is this big old bad Santa doing?
Brennan: Big old bad Santa is not looking great. Big old bad Santa's gotta be like dancing and shit.
Emily: He’s dancing.
Zac: I think I'm gonna try to just—
Emily: Join me.
Zac: Just run up and Divine Smite him.
Brennan: Rad. Do you have any spells left to Divine Smite with?
Zac: It's my last one.
"Brennan: Last one, cool."
Zac: I've used two so far.
"Brennan: Cool, one, two, three. You run up. You see, yes Sofie's in the ribcage kicking the shit out of this thing’s heart."
Sofia: Hey!
"Ricky: Hey, just hang on Santa. I'm coming to get you! You're the opposite of Santa."
Brennan: Go ahead and take your attack.
Zac: That is a 17.
Brennan: 17 hits.
"Zac: Cool and then for— so, I add 2d8 on top of the d8?"
Murph: Yep.
Emily: You get 2d8? Holy shit.
"Murph: So that’s how a smite is, yeah."
"Zac: So, 14. Sorry, that was a 7 and then a 3 and then an 8."
Ally: Whoa! 18!
"Zac: So, 7, 3, 8, and then plus 7."
Murph: [raising his eyebrows] Jesus.
"Zac: So, 14, 17 and 25."
"Emily: 25, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: You guys see, you rush up to go save Santa. You go “you're the opposite of Santa”. You leap up and fully decapitate the entire thing. You just leap straight up into the air. You guys see that Ricky's ax glows with this incredible brilliant light and actually the blade, like, elongates— not the metal part but the light gleaming off it elongates to perfectly— and safely!— sever. Head— [growling]"
"Emily: Wait can I— can I safely catch Santa, so we can land together, since I’m right with him?"
Brennan: Go and give me an Acrobatics check.
Lou: Don't drop Santa.
Emily: [finger guns] 24 baby.
Brennan: You land with Santa Claus perfectly in your arms.
"Sofia: You do so much for all of us, someone needs to look out for you."
Santa: Well now it looks like I'm on your lap! Oh ho ho ho!
Sofia: Someone take a Polaroid! I'll put it on my fridge.
Zac: I do a selfie. [clicks]
"Brennan: Incredible, you see that the decapitated bod— actually the head falls away, the decapitated body starts to dance up Broadway [jingling bells, roaring] and like spurt blood and eventually collapses over by the Sbarro’s. [cast laughs] You see— cool, the mutants all sort of scream and they're no longer possessed with purpose, but they are violently lashing out still."
Murph: Okay.
"Brennan: So, that is Ricky's turn. Santa's there, Ricky's there. These guys actually are gonna run. Misty, you get an attack of opportunity on that one, if you want."
"Siobhan: Great. I mean, I'll use my umbrella with a knife inside of it."
Brennan: Hell yeah! Go for it.
"Siobhan: To go for his little ribs. 11? No, wait— 14."
Brennan: 14 hits.
Siobhan: Great. That is 4 points of damage.
Brennan: Not bad!
Siobhan: But I helped in other ways.
Lou: There you go.
"Emily: Yeah, girl."
Siobhan: Hah! Ha-cha.
"Brennan: Dope! You see-and that was just your reaction, so that's just for free. These guys are gonna take some swings now. Two of them are going for Ricky, one of them hits you, Ricky, for 6 points of damage."
"Zac: Okay, I'm still at 7."
"Brennan: Let's see— six of these guys. Cool, one's gonna take a swing at you Pete, misses. Three of them are gonna take swings on Kingston. Actually, two of them take swings on Kingston, miss. I'm gonna need you to roll a Dexterity saving throw."
"Lou: Ooh, nat 1."
Brennan: You take 5 points of frost damage.
"Siobhan: [offscreen, to Lou] Are you down?"
"Brennan: As one of them belches peppermint at you. Two take sw— One takes a swing at Kugrash, misses."
Lou: [to Siobhan] I had full health.
"Sofia: Kug, I’m coming for ya."
Brennan: Give me a Dex save.
"Emily: Wait, Kug is down?"
"Murph: No no no no, I'm— Dex save."
Emily: Oh! Dex save.
"Murph: Oh, but I'm proficient. Oh, no I'm not proficient. Just 9."
Brennan: You take 8 points of cold damage.
"Murph: Fuck, I'm so hurt. I'm at 2."
Lou: Down in 20.
Emily: Okay.
"Zac: Down to 20, what..."
Lou: Down to 20.
"Brennan: Yes, these Santas are like clobbering you Kingston, they’re slashing you with tentacles. You see that Santa looks at these clones as he's like, sort of sitting in your lap and you see that he looks at these two right around Ricky. And you see he says,"
"Santa: Well, this just—"
"Brennan: And you see it’s like, blood’s coming from his head. He has like incisions in his stomach and his coat's torn where something like laid eggs in him. And you see he goes,"
"Santa: Well, this simply won't do at all. You two— [low voice] get in the bag."
"Brennan: And opens the bag up. You see that these two Santas [whoom!] are sucked into his bag and are just gone. So he says,"
Santa: Some things are better left in the bag.
Sofia: Don’t I know it.
"Brennan: That's gonna be, Sofie."
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna gently place Santa down and then I want to—"
Zac: [laughing] He’s still in your arms after that.
"Emily: I wanna run. Actually, maybe I'll keep him in my arms as I run."
"Brennan: Yeah, you— sure, you carry Santa."
"Emily: I carry Santa, I wanna shove myself in between Kug and these two guys."
"Brennan: Okay, cool."
Emily: Can I do that?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can actually make like a shove attack if you wanna make an opposed Athletics with one."
"Kugrash: Hey, I'm walking here."
"Emily: Yeah, well would that be like, I can't do like a regular attack on them then if I do that?"
"Brennan: You have plenty of attacks. So, you can make one of your attacks an Athletics to push them away and then take your other attacks."
"Emily: Okay, cool so I'll make an Athletics to push them away."
Brennan: You gotta beat a 14.
"Emily: I got a 14 and then I'm adding 6 to it. So, 20."
"Brennan: You just roundhouse this guy and knock him back five feet you get in between Kugrash. You're still holding Santa. You see that Santa goes like,"
"Santa: [laughing] Yes, you are a gifted martial artist!"
"Sofia: Well, you know cardio kickboxing has its benefits. More than just for the nice glutes."
"Ricky: She needs shoes, Santa!"
"Kugrash: She's got shoes, she's got bags."
Emily: And then I'm gonna attack the other one that I didn't.
Brennan: Go for it.
"Emily: Okay. Okay, ten is gonna hit, you said?"
Cast laughs.
Brennan: Ten does not hit.
(Ally and Murph overlapping)
Ally: Wow. Wow.
Murph: 10 confirmed hit?
"Emily: And then do I still get my bonus action to— when my like unarmed, or when I’m hit, or I used that."
"Brennan: No, I think you used that."
"Emily: Okay, alright."
Brennan: But you got that guy away from Kugrash. That's gonna be Pete.
"Ally: Cool, oh with Wild Magic Surge did you want me to roll like the d—"
Brennan: I actually rolled that over here.
"Ally: Oh! Cool, cool. Okay, great. Okay, I— I don't know, I could do..."
Zac: You got those Sorcery Points back.
Emily: Yeah.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, true. Okay, yeah I'm gonna do..."
Zac: It sucks that they blow up when you kill them.
"Ally: Yeah, fully. Man, I don't know. I guess I'll cast Sleep some more and try to like affect more people with it."
"Brennan: Yeah, you see that there's some injured ones around. Yeah, for sure. Go ahead and you can cast Sleep again. Go for it, roll 5d8."
Ally: Cool and then I can-can I do use those Sorcery Points to add more to the sleep thing or do you think that's...
"Brennan: You can— you can do the Sorcery Points. Well, what I would say actually also is that you know these guys are hurt by fire a lot. So, Fire Bolt's not a bad idea either. If you just wanna just want to keep using a cantrip."
Murph: Or Scorching Ray.
Ally: Scorching Ray's out cause I already used my second level spell.
Brennan: But you could use your Sorcery Points to turn them into a spell.
"Ally: Exactly. Hey, you know what? We got there. I use a Sorcery— oh no, sorry, I use two."
Brennan: You have to actually use all three of your Sorcery Points to be able to do that.
"Ally: Okay, cool, yeah. Then I'm gonna do Scorching Ray. I can do..."
Brennan: Three attacks with that.
"Ally: Yeah, okay, so for the first one, 16. Next one, 13 with 6 is 19. Fuck yeah. 17."
[tense orchestral music fades in]
Brennan: All of them hit. Roll 2d6 and let me know which ones you’re attacking.
"Ally: Okay, there's one right in front of me, right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
Ally: Get him for 6.
Brennan: Not down but badly badly injured.
"Ally: Okay, so no. Probably another one."
"Brennan: Another one will do it, Yeah."
"Ally: Ah, but he’s getting— whatever, 8."
Brennan: That'll do it. [explosion]
"Ally: And then the final one, I'll aim it at this one, I guess, that’s piling up."
"Brennan: Cool, hell yeah, go for it."
"Ally: Come on two sixes, come on. Ah, 6 and a 2, 8."
"Brennan: 8, you see— badly, badly injured that one, by Kingston. (growls loudly) As you pull on this weird nightmarish thing. You see that, again, your arm like opens up into tatters for fire to like come out of the center of you blasting out of your arm. Weird shit. That's going to now be Misty."
Siobhan: I'm gonna turn— I'm gonna come over here and cast Cure Wounds on Kugrash.
Kugrash: Thank you so much.
Brennan: And is your Unicorn Totem still up?
Murph: Yes.
"Brennan: Sorry, that doesn't do it. Yeah, she’d do it."
"Murph: Yeah, it’s only if I do it."
"Siobhan: So, that's 9 points and then I try to find something on you that I can compliment and I'm just like,"
Misty: You—
Murph: I just look at you with dead rat eyes.
"Misty: You, you seem very nice."
"Kugrash: Hey, thanks so much."
Siobhan: And I give him Bardic Inspiration.
Ally: You seem nice.
Kugrash: Let’s shake hands on it.
Misty: Mm! [presses her lips tightly together]
"Brennan: [laughs] Kugrash, after that lovely compliment, that's gonna be your turn."
"Murph: Awesome. Okay, I wanna do— I wanna hit as many guys as possible. So, I might take an opportunity attack here from this one guy. So, I want to do Thunderwave, which is a cube or-originating from me, so I need to get away if I don't wanna hit my friend. So I'm gonna take a hit from this guy. So, one, two, three, I'll move over here."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Uh, four, I wanna try to— I want to hit these three guys."
"Brennan: Dope, awesome."
"Murph: So, they make Dex saves."
"Brennan: Rad, the one guy misses you. I think Thunderwave— my understanding is that the cube is a 15-foot cube originating from you, meaning you're in the center, right? Or is it?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Or, would that be-that would be a 5-foot radius I guess, right?"
Siobhan: It’s from self.
"Brennan: So, this is— so can you put the cube wherever you want?"
Murph: I think it's from me.
"Siobhan: No, it's from self."
"Brennan: So, I think it only affects people within 5 feet of you."
"Murph: Okay, so then I'll just go back here and get these two."
"Brennan: Cool. Awesome, go ahead and roll your damage."
"Murph: Sweet, 8."
Brennan: You see that the one that was injured by Pete is blown away. This guy is fully knocked. What direction do you want this guy to go flying in?
"Murph: 10 feet, let's send him that way."
Emily: Send them my way.
"Brennan: Blown back, Pete's is gone."
"Murph: I light up a dirty puddle. It smells like shit, just sizzling, fucking—"
Ally: And we can tell that you like it.
"Kugrash: What, I don’t like it, it’s just-we-we live in a shit city, I’m not smiling, I don’t like it."
Pete: You’re smiling. You’re smiling.
"Kingston: Kugrash, you like it, it’s okay."
Sofia: I feel like you’re taking extra sniffs of it.
"Kugrash: [sniffs] You wanna know how it smells, you're curious."
"Brennan: Kingston, that’s gonna be you."
"Lou: Cool, I mean we seem to just be chilling at this— everyone seems to be doing fine. So I'll, hell, I’ll— let me get in on this action. I'll Sacred Flame the dude who seems to be almost dead."
"Brennan: Go for it, man. Go ahead and roll your attack roll."
Lou: I think you just make a Dexterity saving throw for them.
"Brennan: Ooh, very fun! Yeah, Sacred Flame. Oh, a Dexterity saving throw, yes."
Lou: They succeed or they take 1d8.
Brennan: He fails.
"Lou: Hell yes! Great! With joy, a 7."
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys see Kingston turn around. You raise your hand, your eyes glow brilliant white and a (whoom), burst of like— again, it's an— it's hard to tell if it's moving like air or fire but this brilliant thing goes (whoom) and you see the Santa clone goes,"
"Santa Clone: [sad, garbled singing] Silent Night...."
"Brennan: (whoosh) Head catches in flame. Rad, that's going to be Ricky."
"Zac: How hurt— I guess I should just kill the one next to you, right?"
"Murph: Yeah, just kill some guys."
Ricky: I'm just gonna run up to the one next to Kingston and just attack it.
Brennan: Hell yeah! Go ahead and roll a— roll attack.
"Lou: Fun, just punching bag."
Zac: Only got 11.
Brennan: 11 actually hits.
Lou laughs in surprise.
Zac: That's a 12.
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Emily: Yah, bitch."
Zac: It's the brittle kind again?
Brennan: Yes.
Ally: Do certain ones hurt us when they explode or not?
Brennan: Yes certain of them— certain of them hurt you when they explode.
Murph: Good thing we picked up on that now.
"Ally: [laughing] Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool, that one is not down yet, but you thud your ax into the side of it. That's going to be this guy now."
"Emily: Yeah, come at me."
Brennan: You see this dude opens up for peppermint breath. I’m gonna need Dex saves from Sofie and Misty.
Emily: Dex saves? Okay.
Siobhan: I got a 19.
Emily: I got an 11. Does that save or do I need to find that out—
Brennan: That does not save.
Emily: I'm gonna use my Bardic Inspiration.
Brennan: Go for it. Oh! You make it! You each take 2 cold damage. Misty Moore's right behind you. What could go wrong? That's a real celebrity.
Sofia: Oh my god!
"Siobhan: Wait, how many points of damage was that?"
Brennan: 2.
"Siobhan: Okay, great, so I'm at 13."
"Brennan: One of them takes a swing at Sofie, misses like crazy. It's gonna take another swing at Ricky, and misses Ricky. These guys are down for the count. You see Santa looks at the two next to you, Sofie, once again you see he says,"
"Santa: My, what impressive people."
"Brennan: And then he looks again at these two and goes,"
"Santa: [deep and raspy] Back where you came from, [rips the bag open] the bag!"
Brennan: They disappear into the bag. That's going to be-and then Sofie that's you.
"Emily: All right, only one guy left, right?"
Brennan: That's right.
"Emily: All right, I'm going at ‘em."
Brennan: Have you put down Santa yet?
"Emily: Nope, me and Santa are going. Can I— actually, can I take and go Santa first with the bag and we just try and trap them with the bag."
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely, go ahead—"
"Emily: So I’m gonna say,"
"Sofia: Santa, get the bag out."
Brennan: Go ahead and make an opposed Acrobatics check. You've gotta beat a 17.
Emily: [smugly] I did.
Brennan: You see that you just huck Santa into the air and he goes
Santa: Shabam!
Brennan: And puts the bag over this one.
Lou: “Shabam!”
Brennan: That one is fully gone. And Times Square has been cleared of mutant Santa clones!
[cheerful Christmas-y music]
(players cheering)
Zac: Just a bunch of dead people now.
"Brennan: Just a bunch of dead people who have been fully, fully killed. You see that Santa looks over at you guys and says"
"Santa: Well, what the fuck happened here?"
Kugrash: Someone laid eggs in you.
Sofia: Yeah.
Ricky: What’s go—
Santa pukes.
(players groan)
Brennan: You look and see a bunch-he's holding kind of see-through gel eggs that have a bunch of little tadpoles with Santa hats on them.
Sofia: Oh my god.
"Santa: This is very bad, very very bad."
Sofia: Who did this to you? Do you know?
"Santa: I don't remember much. We were accosted by— well I, you know, I had to come here to deposit to my clones. Not all of them. Most, again the vast 99.9% of the clones turn out fine but the defective ones had to be brought here to be deposited within the sphere of the Umbral Arcana. So, that it would not raise suspicion and I landed the sleigh near Belvedere Castle in the park and before I knew it, something happened. Some of the clones that I was pouring out of the bag— they acted up. Normally, the clones are very, they'll vandalize things or they'll explode or other things like that but they're not generally this harmful. I don't know what's happened this time. Something knocked me unconscious. Something attacked me in the sleigh. The sleigh! Where's my sleigh?"
Kugrash: It's still in the park.
Sofia: Covered in some fancy script.
"Brennan: He sort of looks at this,"
"Santa: Well, this is very strange indeed. I need to go to my sleigh at once. By the way, hello, I am Santa Claus."
Kugrash: Good to see you again Santa.
Sofia: Hi Santa.
"Misty: Big fan, big fan of your work."
Ricky: What kind of bag is that?
"Santa: It's a magic bag, bigger on the inside than the out [threateningly] and it contains many things which should not see the light of day."
Ricky: Okay.
Pete: Okay.
"Santa: Well hello, young man, and what is your name?"
Pete: Jeffrey.
"Santa: Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey. I don't think that's true."
Pete: I should probably get outta here you guys.
Kugrash: Why are you lying to Santa?
"Pete: I panicked, man. You never say your real name."
"Brennan: So, all of you guys here in Times Square, you look around there are dead bodies, peppermint blood everywhere. The horrifying Santa's killed. There’s still that one sleeping mutant Santa and the twitching carapace— you know— larval body of the Santa clone queen. Santa looks around at you guys and says,"
"Santa: Something very strange is happening here. But then again it's [laughing] New York City, I wouldn't expect anything less. [points straight up] Greatest city in the world."
Kugrash: You're hilarious Santa.
Santa: This guy gets me. How you doing Kugrash?
"Kugrash: Good, good to see you."
"Santa: Kugrash, wonderful. (gestures to Misty) Huge fan of your work."
Misty: Huge fan of your work.
"Santa: What you do is incredible, my god."
"Misty: Oh no, are you kidding? What you do has changed lives."
Santa: Can I ask you a question?
Misty: Yeah.
Santa: Have you ever considered doing a Christmas album? I don't want to push the idea.
"Misty: You know I've really been thinking about it because, you know between you and me, they sell like wildfire."
Santa: They sell like crazy.
Misty: A very Misty Christmas? I'm— I'm doing it! I’m gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
Santa points excitedly at Misty.
Sofia: I would buy that so fast. I'm sick of my Josh Groban one.
"Misty: You know, I do love Josh. He's a good, sweet boy."
"Sofia: I know, but I've listened to it so many times."
Misty: I get it.
Santa: I understand. Kingston.
Kingston: Good to see you Santa.
Santa: Good to see you.
Kingston: You have to come by. I need to take those eggs out of you.
"Santa: Oh, I am filled with eggs."
"Kingston: Yeah, you’re filled with-but you come by whenever you get a chance."
"Santa: I should get up to the sleigh, but maybe after the sleigh we'll head over to the hospital. You can—"
Kingston: Great.
"Santa: I do appreciate it. I also have a weird, it's not a mole but it's basically, just I don't know."
Kingston: I'll take a look at it.
Santa: I appreciate it.
Kingston: I got time!
Sofia: You’ve gotta get that checked out.
Ricky: It looks like you’ve got an egg on your back.
"Santa: Oh, there's another egg? Oh, it’s another egg."
Kingston: It's just a big brown egg.
"Kugrash: Santa, Can I have an egg?"
Santa: What’s that?
Kugrash: Can I have an egg?
Kingston: Santa don't give this boy an egg.
Kugrash: I just want to see the egg.
Kingston: You don't need an egg.
Santa: You've been a very good little boy.
Brennan: He reaches into the sack and pulls out a beautiful little like Christmassy nutcracker Faberge egg.
Santa: That's for you.
"Kugrash: Cool, fancy egg."
Santa: A very fancy egg for a very—
Kugrash: Thank you.
"Santa: —not fancy boy. But, a good boy nonetheless. Ricky."
"Ricky: Hi, Santa."
"Santa: We haven't met before, but you don't seem that fazed that I'm here."
"Ricky: Yeah, it just seems fine. You're told when you're a child Santa's, you know, coming, so. I've just known about you for a long time."
Santa: Has there not been a— has there not been a dip for you as an adult where there was a period of time where you thought I— I am real. But are you saying that you haven't had any time where you didn't think I was real?
"Ricky: No. I pretty much, I've always believed in you. It would be crazy if you weren't real because you're such a good person."
(cast laughing)
"Brennan: You see, he looks at you and says,"
"Santa: Sofie, you are welcome at the North Pole anytime you'd like to come."
"Sofia: I love to travel, I'll be up. Absolutely."
"Santa: (looking at Pete) Now, I know how I can find out your name. Let's head up to, you would you mind showing me to where my sleigh is?"
"Kugrash: Yeah, absolutely."
"Santa: Very well, here we go! [puts a finger on his nose]"
"Brennan: And you guys are whisked away on snowy wind. Santa goes,"
"Santa: Ho ho ho! I could also change all of your size as well, you know for chimneys and the like but also for fun."
[roaring wind and chiming jingle bells]
Kugrash: Make me even smaller.
Santa: I'll make you— I’ll make us all so small.
Brennan: You guys all shrink.
"Sofia: Do you just— do it on my waist, you know?"
"Santa: I can't spot it like that, but that'd be nice. You know, Santa's got a little bit of a gut here too."
"Sofia: Hey, you know, lived in."
"Santa: Honestly, Mrs. Claus likes it."
Sofia: I'm not surprised.
Brennan: You guys are so tiny. The giant-snowflakes are like these skyscraper size structures around you.
"Santa: Yes, Christmas magic! Ho! Ho! Ho!"
"Brennan: You guys arrive in Central Park. [vague background talking sound effect] You see that the sleigh is still there. There are now a lot of cops around here. It's been, like, cordoned off as like a crime scene. You see, Pete, again this like wispy shadow fire stuff over the sleigh as a bunch of humans are kind of like looking at it. And you see that one of the cops looking at it says"
"Cop: Goddamn, looks like somebody, uh, took their Camry and drove it all the way through the park and crashed it over here into this tree. These crazy drunk drivers man, it's nuts. Car like this, I’m amazed it got this far!"
Brennan: And you see that all the cops looking at the sleigh appear to be seeing a Toyota Camry.
"Sofia: Kug, would I have seen a Toyota Camry in the past?"
"Kugrash: You— have you seen a— oh, before you..."
"Sofia: Like the cops,"
"Murph: I think she saw a sleigh, right?"
"Sofie: Ever since I started hanging out with you, I've been seeing a lot of crazy shit. I thought you weren't real, and then all, you introduced me to all your friends and I've been seeing crazy shit. So, I'm saying was I on the other side?"
"Kugrash: Yeah, you— you would have seen this as a Toyota Camry a couple of days ago I would think— when you weren't drunk."
"Ally: I think I'd go up to Santa and say,"
Pete: Thanks so much for all your help. I can't be around this many cops though.
Ally: And I go to shake your hand but I press like a bag of cocaine into your hand.
Santa: What is— oh! A little bit of magic snow?
"Pete: I know you gotta stay up all night, so."
"Santa: Oh, this is cocaine."
Pete: Mm-hmm.
Santa: I can't take this.
"Pete: No, no, no hey it's free. It is on credit but it's free. So, next time you see me then maybe you can get me back."
"Santa: Well, I appreciate the offer but I'm a spirit for children and I shouldn't have cocaine."
"Pete: Oh, you want, what, 2CB? I got stuff that makes you up but [waves a finger past his face] you get it."
"Santa: Pete, your soul is in jeopardy."
Pete: What?
Santa: I am not going to lie. I need to find something.
"Brennan: You see that Santa moves and you see he goes (whoosh) just turns into a little whirlwind of snow, moves past the cops. You guys see that there is one police officer that recognizes you guys and starts to walk over to you. There's only— a group of people kind of like gathered around. It's like onlookers and people like that. Pete and Sofie, you guys are looking at like a Central Park horse cop for a second and then that shadowy stuff kind of peels off and a full centaur. She walks up to you— she's got like the cop uniform and like the helmet. Stern, strong-looking face, walks up and says,"
"Epona Cirillo: [nods] Nurse Brown, good to see you."
"Kingston: Epona, good to see you."
"Epona: Yeah, how's it going? You guys know anything about this?"
Pete: I don’t know nothin’.
Kugrash: We think Pixies—
Epona: Who's this kid?
Sofia and Kingston: That's Jeffrey.
"Epona: Hey, Jeff, you wanna say hi to my horse."
"Pete: I do love horses actually, yeah."
Brennan: Make a Deception check for me real quick.
"Ally: Okay. Oh, a lot— 19."
"Brennan: Oh 19. Yeah she kind of narrows her eyes and looks at you, looks back at the rest of you and sort of pipes down and says,"
Epona: [quietly] Any idea what happened here?
Kugrash: You know Santa was knocked out. I saw some pixie stuff around here.
"Misty: Yeah, but it was weird pixie stuff. I think that maybe it was somebody trying to cover up and make it look like it was pixies, because underneath it was infernal."
"Epona: Infernal, you're not kidding. You guys have any more of this sort of evidence anywhere or anything we could take a look at?"
Kingston: Didn't you bite the glyph off the glove— the glove box?
"Kugrash: Yeah, I got that."
Emily: I mean aren't some of us like covered in goo?
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys are covered in goo."
Sofia: You could just kinda take a cotton swab to me.
"Brennan: You see she nods, takes a little forensics kit. Swabs you guys. Looks at the glyph and says,"
Epona: All right I'm gonna enter this into evidence. All right with you?
"Brennan: Takes the glyph. You see that she looks over at Santa coming back from the sleigh. You see that she sort of, you know, salutes to Santa as he approaches, he comes back and says,"
"Santa: It's gone, it's gone."
Kugrash: Wh— what’s gone?
Sofia: Your sleigh?
"Kingston: What's gone, Santa?"
Santa: My list. My list.
Pete: Like your good and bad list?
Misty: Sounds like somebody's been very naughty indeed.
Santa: It's— it was in the glove box of the sleigh. That's where I keep it.
Ricky: Can you just make a new list?
"Pete: Yeah is it really that important? I mean,"
Kugrash: What do people do with the list?
Santa: Can I just make a new— you know how much work goes into making that list?
Kugrash: It's a fucking magic list.
"Sofia: So, presumably if someone had access to that list, they would know who the bad people were, thus the corruptible souls?"
"[dark, tense music]"
"Santa: My goodness! Oh, dear! Dear, dear, dear, dear. They would indeed know the corruptible souls."
Pete: Do you know who was on the bad list?
Santa gives a knowing look to Pete. Pete frowns and looks away.
Ricky: Am I on the bad list?
"Santa: Ricky, no. You are not on the bad list."
"Kingston: Santa, what are we talking about man? Like, are you— what, like what could somebody do, how powerful is this list?"
Santa: It's extremely important that we find this list and get it back.
"Misty: Have you thought about, maybe just for the future— as one old fellow to another— you digitized the list, put some kind of—"
Santa: I'm not digitizing the shop.
Ricky: You could put the list on the cloud.
Misty: It’s just harder for people to steal it that way—
Sofia: That’s almost easier to hack. In this day and age—
Kingston: My cousins helped me do it and it was— I've been very thankful since.
Misty: At least for next year.
"Santa: I need to get back to the North Pole. This is quite bad. So, the naughty and nice list was something that we work very hard on at the North Pole. And it's actually so well done and well kept that I was reached out to by some other entities to sort of use the list— not the physical list, which is very important that I have on me but. Well, you know basically St. Peter reached out to me and said that it was crazy for him to keep his book and me to keep the list at the same time and that it would be better to just sort of consolidate that effort and I got reached out to by, well you know, ‘ol [points down] downstairs fellow as well. So, Heaven and Hell have kind of been using my list for a while."
"Misty: Santa, are you Cambridge Analytica?"
(players laugh)
"Santa: Oh, ho ho ho ho! A prescient commentary. Yes, I am that."
"Misty: [sighs] That's bad, seems like they could just keep their own lists."
"Santa: You would think that, wouldn't you?"
Misty: Yeah.
"Ricky: Wait, so they already had it?"
"Santa: No, no, no I mean Heaven and Hell have been using my list for their bookkeeping purposes as well. Cause we were— basically, we were making a bunch of versions of the same list. Hell has to keep a record of everyone's good and bad and Heaven has to keep a record of everyone's good and bad."
Sofia: So risky.
"Ricky: You're saying this that someone could maybe use that to get out of Hell or something like that? Or, like if you didn't have the list,"
"Santa: I should go, I should really get out of here. Can we go to the hospital?"
Kingston: Sure.
"Santa: Okay, well—"
Sofia: Does that list have the kind of power that if you wrote someone's name that it could change? You could change their status?
Santa: I don't think just anybody could write on that list.
"Misty: But say a powerful magic user. The type that could take down Santa, and destroy his sleigh, and scatter his reindeer to the wind, I guess."
Brennan: I need Pete to- that very last spell that you cast. I need you to roll Wild Magic Surge for me real quick.
Ally: 5.
"Brennan: 5\. Good, nothing happens. You feel a welling up of magical energy as all this- your world was normal yesterday, or as normal as your life ever got. And, you feel swelling up and suddenly that little gray child's face appears in your vision again and says,"
Gray Child: Heed the words of Lazarus.
Brennan: And disappears.
"Santa: Well, suffice it to say this is very bad. I have much work- I'm already behind schedule. I've been here longer than I should have. Kingston we can go to the hospital if you want, or- there is work that needs to be done at the North Pole that I should get back for."
"Brennan: You see he goes and does this loud whistle and you see that a bunch of the flying reindeer come back and you see that [whooshing] land in the park. He begins like hitch them back up to the sleigh [hooves clopping] and looks over at you guys and says,"
Santa: I need to go back to the North Pole and tell people what has happened.
"Misty: Yeah, again man, maybe just get a phone."
"Santa: Misty, what a dry wit. I could do that."
Misty: Get with the times.
Santa: You know I just like the aesthetic of the analog stuff. It just feels more in keeping with the-
"Misty: Who knew Santa was such a hipster, am I right?"
"Santa: Who wants to go to the North Pole and see a bunch of elves with iPads, you know. Not I."
Kingston: Who's going to the North Pole?
Santa: (intensely) Nobody.
Sofia: I thought I was invited?
"Santa: Oh, Sofie, you are invited. Yes, yes, yes."
"Sofia: I probably— maybe, maybe April break."
"Santa: Great, April's not a busy time for us."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Santa: The elves are of course busy, but I'm cer— you know, me and the deer only really [wheezing] work one day out of the year. All right, you've all been wonderful. Happy holidays, I wish you all the best. If you hear anything about that list the fate of the world may depend on it but it— might be, I don't know. I don't really know but I'm going to figure it out. Take care. You sure you don't wanna tell me your name?"
"Pete: Yeah, my name's Pete. I will say that there has been this dark force inviting me and I think I— I think it said to me, I leave today. This morning."
Santa: That sounds like something you all should check out. Farewell.
Bells start jingling. Pete yells.
Kingston: [waving calmly] Bye Santa.
"Santa: On Dancer, on Dancer, on Prancer, on Blitzen!"
Emily: What happened to the rest of them?
"Brennan: You see they take off— You see that a bunch of the human cops look as this weird thing of like shadow treads up to the sleigh. They all look as the sleigh just disappears and they all stare at it for a long time and they all go,"
"Cop: [haltingly] Yep, I guess that tow truck just got the Camry off to the impound… good, good, good, good."
Brennan: And they'll start to walk away.
Sofia: So embarrassing I used to live like that.
"Brennan: Epona looks at you guys and says,"
"Epona: You, any of you all need a hand with anything or are you all alright?"
Sofia: You got a bottle opener?
"Epona: Bottle opener? No, I don't have a bottle opener."
"Sofia: It's fine, I'll use my teeth."
"Kugrash: Can’t have open containers. Don’t do it, man."
"Sofia: We're magic, how about that. A magic aura hides my Mike’s Hard Lemonade."
Kugrash: She’s also magic.
Emily: And I open it with my teeth.
"Epona: Okay, I'm gonna have to give you a ticket for that."
Sofia: Really?
Epona: Open container in Central Park.
Kugrash: She’s a cop.
"Epona: I might be a centaur, but sometimes rules are rules."
"Sofia: All right, I'll take the ticket."
Kugrash: You opened it right in front of a cop! What are you doing?
"Brennan: And that's where we’re gonna end for this episode of the Unsleeping City. Tune in next week, we'll see you guys there."

Alejandro: This is a very special moment in the history of the Unsleeping City.

"Mario: Sofie, what the fuck are you doing here?"
Kingston: Running up in a Mafia's wedding is not a good way to get answers. It’s a good way to get the shit kicked out of you.
(Ally yelling)
Alejandro: Do not take it lightly that a wizard is in your debt.
Ally: I feel sad.
Sofia: (gasps) Something's going wrong-

[RECAP]
"Brennan: We descend into Times Square with this strange, icy fortress."
Emily: Can I just heave that shit off me?
[man grunts]
Brennan: You fling the entire chrysalis off into the sky.
Siobhan: What?
Ally: No!
[members groaning]
"Kugrash: Oh, is that Santa?"
Ally: Santa!
Siobhan: Santa!
"Brennan: Ah, it's crushing me!"
"Ricky: Hang on, Santa, I'm coming to get you."
Brennan : You leap up and fully decapitate the entire--
Murph: Holy cow! Holy shit!
"Santa : [laughs manically] Ho ho ho! What the fuck happened here? The sleigh, where's my sleigh?"
Kugrash: Still in the park.
Brennan: You guys arrive in Central Park. A full centaur walks up.
Epona: Any idea what happened here?
Kugrash: I saw some pixie stuff around here.
Misty: Maybe it was somebody trying to cover up and make it look like it was pixies because underneath it was infernal.
Santa: It's gone.
Sofia: The sleigh?
"Kugrash: What's gone, Santa?"
Santa: My list.
Kugrash: How powerful is this list?
Sofia: It's extremely important that we find this list and get it back.
Pete: I will say that there has been this dark force inviting me.
Santa: That sounds like something you all should check out.
[END RECAP]
[video scratches]
"Upbeat music plays, and there is the intro, which is the words DIMENSION 20, UNSLEEPING CITY over a skyline in a circle that rotates until it is upside down."
"Brennan: Welcome back, one and all, to The Unsleeping City. My name is Brennan Lee Mulligan. These are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: And last we left them off they were near the promenade in Central Park in a version of New York with magic around every corner, indeed. But we have gotten our first taste of The Unsleeping City. Santa Claus' sleigh has just been [whooshing] flown away by jolly old Saint Nick himself, and his eight tiny reindeer."
"Siobhan: Bye Santa, we love you."
"Brennan: And the cops who perceived it as a Toyota Camry being towed away due to the strange Umbral Arcana that prevents New Yorkers from noticing pretty much anything weird happening, have now begun to disband. You guys see Officer Epona Cirillo, a centaur cop, has entered now this piece of Santa's dashboard with this strange fae runes with some infernal underneath it. She's taking that to go enter it into evidence. The wind kicks up, a little bit of snow flies around. You six companions, bedraggled by some combat, but all standing at this point, now stand here in snowy Central Park as the crowd kind of chatters and talks to each other about this crazy car crash."
"Pedestrian: Can you believe this shit? Some fuckin' drunk driver must have taken a car right into the tree, man, I tell ya."
"Brennan: You are left with each other, snow whipping around you, the cold, brisk, New York day late in the afternoon. Pete, you feel that sweet peppermint tooth still in your head. Look around. Sofia, you now see the centaur walking away that a mere three days ago would have just looked like a horse cop to you, and the rest of these denizens of The Unsleeping City, you guys all know that something very strange indeed has happened. What do you guys wanna do?"
[dramatic piano music]
"Kugrash: Hey Pete, lemme see your old tooth there."
Pete: Like my—
"Kugrash: Yeah, your—"
Pete: Should I just rip it out? I don't want this in my mouth.
"Misty: No, no, no."
Pete: It's gonna rot in my teeth.
"Kugrash: Ah, it's not appropriate."
"Kingston: Nobody has to be rippin' teeth out, all right?"
Kugrash: Let's have a vote. [raises hand] I say rip it out.
Sofia: I agree with Kug. [raises hand]
"Kingston: Okay, I don't like any of this. As the trained medical professional here, nobody's rippin' teeth out of nobody's mouth."
"Sofia: Truthfully, I just said it 'cause it sounded fun."
"Kugrash: You know what? Ultimately, Pete, it's up to you."
Pete: I can't be missing a tooth and selling drugs. That's too dangerous.
Sofia: That's true.
"Ricky: Probably shouldn't be doing either, yeah."
"Sofia: These days, people hold drug dealers to a very high standard."
Pete: I'm gonna leave the tooth in and keep sellin'.
Kugrash: Can I look at it very closely?
Pete: Yeah.
"Murph: [chuckles] Okay, I pry open his mouth and look in."
Brennan: The dirtiest rat fingers of all time.
"Kingston: I mean, Kugrash, you're supposed to wear gloves or something, man."
"Kugrash: Hey, it's fine, it's fine. You go camping, you're touching the dirt, and you're sleepin', you do whatever, who cares?"
Misty: Where are you camping?
Pete: You touched the dirt?
Kugrash: I camp every night. I live in the subway station.
[Misty gags]
"Sofia: Don't worry, I've eaten so many sandwiches from his dirty hands."
"Brennan: Kugrash, what are you rolling right now?"
"Murph: A Medicine check, maybe?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it!"
"Murph: Cool. [rolls, it falls off the table] Goddamn it. [rolls again] Ooh, 23."
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely! Well, you take a look. The peppermint tooth, it seems that Kingston's vaccine that he put in there earlier has fully stopped this transformation, but it looks..."
[suspenseful chime music]
"Brennan: This shouldn't be here. Kingston's medicine should have reverted his tooth back to regular bone. Something about the intrinsic nature of Pete's DNA or maybe even something more profound and spiritual than that is keeping this peppermint tooth here. And though it tastes sweet, you don't see it corroding. You don't see the saliva eating away at it at all. If you had to guess, you had a very good roll. If you had to guess, the tooth is there because it wants to be and something about Pete means it's more fun if it's there than if it's not."
Murph: Hmm.
"Kugrash: I mean, it's fine, it's fine. It's just a fuckin' peppermint tooth."
"Pete: Good. Good, it's fine."
"Kugrash: I don't know, you got a peppermint tooth."
Ricky: Here's some multivitamins if you wanna just take one if you're worried about the swelling.
"Pete: Hell yeah, I haven't swallowed a pill in four hours."
"Sofia: You do know that they’re a crock of shit, right?"
Kingston: Those really are a crock of shit.
Sofia: They are a crock of shit.
"Ricky: We're talking Vitamin C, B12."
Misty: Truly.
Kugrash: Should we talk to the wizards who—
"Kingston: Yeah, you should go."
"Misty: We should come out and see. Oh, I think they have a place near here, right?"
"Sofia: Real quick, 'cause I'm kinda new to this. Magic is just real?"
"Ricky: Yeah, pretty much."
"Kingston: Yeah, I actually wanna check in with you two. Are you guys doin' okay?"
Pete: I was gonna say.
Kingston: You guys woke up this morning and--
Pete: Just like talk to you privately.
Kingston: You wanna talk to me?
Pete: I would love to just run and get dumplings with Kingston if we have time.
"Kingston: Hey, you wanna grab some coffee real quick?"
Pete: [laughs] Yeah.
"Kingston: Hey, we're gonna go grab some coffee for everyone. Do we wanna head somewhere? Do we wanna go talk to Alejandro at the Gramercy Occult Society? Maybe let him know what's going on with all the information we just got?"
Pete: Yeah.
Kugrash: That's not a bad idea. You guys can walk ahead.
"Kingston: Yeah, we'll walk ahead."
"Sofia: And do you guys want, maybe someone could just refresh me on what you guys talk about. I just wanna know what's going on with magic."
"Pete: I wasn't gonna do it this publicly, but you know what, it happens. I don't really know if I jive with any of you, but Kingston, I feel I can trust you."
Misty: Darling!
Pete: I got some questions.
Misty: Here's the deal. Magic is real and you get to see it. Isn't that great?
Pete: Let's go get some coffee. Okay?
Misty: It's so fun!
Kingston: Will you talk to her? [points to Sofia] I’ll talk to— yeah.
"Sofia: That's enough for me, I suppose."
"Brennan: As you guys head off, you see that the actual natural movements of the crowd as you get toward Columbus Circle and start walking, it's not too far of a walk from here to Bryant Park and the public library there, so you guys head off. The crowd naturally moves around Kingston and creates a little pocket of privacy. You guys stop. You have never in your life seen a dumpling cart in New York."
[Ally makes happiness noise]
"Brennan: But you go up and you see that there's a guy standing there who looks around for a second and goes,"
"Dumpling Man: [accented] Ey, Kingston Brown!"
"Kingston: Hey Ricky, good to see you, man. How are you?"
"Dumpling Man: How's it going? I appreciate, good to see you, man, you're looking fit. You're looking good."
"Kingston: Hey, I like the mustache. Is that new?"
"Dumpling Man: It is very new. My girlfriend, she like the wax of the mustache."
"Kingston: Oh, okay, I see, man."
"Dumpling man: She say she want to fuck the Pringles guy. What you can do, huh?"
Pete: Oh.
"Kingston: Hey, that's her business, right?"
"Dumpling man: It's my business now, too. You know how it goes!"
"Kingston: Okay! Hey, my friend's tryin' to get a couple of dumplings. Can you hook it up?"
Pete: Yeah! Can I get some hot and sour pork dumplings?
Dumpling man: Oh for sure! You want some hot and sour pork.
"Brennan: He reaches in [blows], throws some dumplings. You get these little plastic containers. It smells so good."
Pete: Fuck.
"Brennan: He gives you these huge, heaping containers. You have these little spoons that go in 'em."
Ally: I'm rolling a blunt. [laughs]
Pete: I'm not about to eat this sober.
Kingston: Okay.
"Ricky: My name's Ricky, too."
Dumpling Man: Hmm?
"Ricky: My name's Ricky, too."
"Dumpling Man: Oh, Ricky! You're named Ricky, as well?"
Ricky: Yeah.
"Dumpling Man: Nice to meet you, man. Here."
"Brennan: And you see he says,"
Dumpling Man: Hold out your hand.
"Brennan: Hot, wet dumpling right in your hand."
Ricky: Thanks. [immediately eats it]
Pete: Whoa!
"Brennan: You see, he puts these in there. You immediately eat this dumpling. You regain, it's been about a short rest amount of time, but you do regain five hit points from eating this."
"Ally: Oh, cool."
"Brennan: Kingston, I'm not sure if you're full or not, but you regain five hit points as well."
Lou: Great.
Brennan: You guys walk away from the dumpling cart chowing down on these bad boys.They are so tasty and delicious.
[people chattering]
"Ally: I'm smoking and eating, so I'm kinda just like, almost like drinking the dumpling."
"Brennan: So you're full, you'd have to hork down an unchewed dumpling and smoke the spliff in the middle—"
"Pete: Oh, it's blueberry! I should've just picked a natural roll."
"Brennan: Yeah, so you guys have a weird little amount of privacy and the noise of the snow, there's this beautiful thing. New York is a very noisy city, but with the thick snow around you right now, it's actually kind of muffled and you realize that you're having a hard time hearing the people around you and you have a feeling that anything you were to say right now would not be heard, something about the confidence you're keeping with Kingston means that what you're saying wouldn't be heard outside of your conversation right now."
"Pete: Cool. Hey, so what is going on? What the fuck is going on?"
"Kingston: Well, you mean with all the magic and the Santa Claus, and all that bullshit?"
"Pete: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Kingston: Welcome to The Unsleeping City. New York exists in a plane of existence where just below it is The Unsleeping City and just above it is Nod or the Sixth Borough, and so New York is this magical place where The Unsleeping City, which has all these fantastical, magical elements that you keep seeing and shit, bleeds into New York. I don't know what has happened to you, but you, unlike most people in the city, are now able to see all this bullshit, trolls, that centaur person. You know, all of that shit."
"Pete: I just thought I was always fucked up. I've been taking so many drugs for so long. I've seen all this stuff for a while. but I just thought, oh yeah, I was tripping."
"Kingston: Yeah, well, for a while you were, but now something has clearly happened to you with that weird shit that happened back in my nurse's office. There's clearly some magic has been imbued in you."
Pete: Fuck.
"Kingston: Hey, don't fret."
[Pete laughs]
"Kingston: It's gonna be all right, okay? You are in good company. Me and Misty have been doing this for a long time. We're gonna talk to Alejandro."
Pete: Is this like a full-time job or do I still have my life?
"Kingston: You can still have a life, but I'll tell ya, it's gonna be a wild one."
Pete: Fuck.
"Sofia: Hey, sorry, I just think this is information that I also really need to know, I don't want—"
"Murph: Kugrash is using his little rat ears and just translating for you, but in a shitty Kugrash way."
"Brennan: Oh, okay."
"Kugrash: So there's a real New York and there's a fucking fake one. You're in the real one now, so there's fuckin' magic everywhere. We're gonna save the world and shit like how we saved Santa, like that but all the time without fucking everything."
Sofia: Is this a full-time job?
"Kugrash: Eh, it's gonna be a a wild one."
Sofia: A wild job? I'm in.
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Brennan: As you guys walk along, the exact opposite of what's happening to Kingston and Pete is happening to you guys because you can't go fucking five feet in the city without people being like,"
"Fan 1: [high voice, Midwestern accent] Misty!"
"Misty: [waving] Oh, darling, darling."
"Fan 1: God, I'm so sorry to bother you. I'm here with my kids, can you believe it? We're doing a trip for the holidays. [wheezes]"
"Misty: I love that! I love it. New York, it's the greatest city in the world."
"Fan 1: Ah, you're telling me! I always dreamed of coming here. It was this or Paris, and we just couldn't with my mom."
"Misty: Oh, me too, I love Paris, but New York is New York!"
"Fan 1: Oh my god, we see the Broadway shows and everything and the Statue of Liberty's from France, so it's almost like an extra free trip!"
"Misty: Exactly, exactly! There's so many beautiful French monuments right here in New York City."
Fan 1: You're just talking to me like a regular person. I can't even believe it!
"Misty: Oh, stop, everybody's a regular person."
"Brennan: You see that as you continue talking to this family from the Midwest, their smiles light up, and again their adoration wisps off of them in streams of gold and silver and purple and pink."
"Misty sighs happily, and shakes her head, smiling."
[Brennan slurping]
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Fan 1: Well, thank you so much for taking the time, Miss Moore. You didn't have to and it really means a lot."
"Misty: Please, I love my fans. It's not even my fans, you're like my family."
Fan 1: Oh my God! Can you believe someone would say something so nice?
"Brennan: You see that they all chatter excitedly. The dad, who's up to this point said absolutely nothing, just let his wife and his two daughters talk to you, leans in and says,"
"Fan 2: [lower voice, deadpan, Midwestern accent] I thought your performance in that revamp of Assassins was remarkable. I thought it was really remarkable."
"Misty: Stephen Sondheim, my dear Stephen, it's such an astonishing talent, and to be alive when he is alive, we're all just so lucky."
"Fan 2: I mean you're a vision, and I'm sorry, I gotta go."
"Brennan: He turns and walks away. Yeah, you guys continue walking down the street. You eventually arrive at the public library again"
[Map sound]
Brennan: Where you see the two giant stone lions turn to look at you guys.
"Orlando or Rovias: Well, well, well, it seems our friends have returned. And how fared the battle in Times Square?"
Kugrash: We're alive.
"Sofia: Honestly, yeah, pretty good."
Kingston: We did well. Santa's alive. Killed a bunch of mutants.
Misty: I personally had a great time.
"Sofia: If I had to be honest, I think that we saved Christmas."
"Orlando or Rovias: Well, Christmas is saved. Splendid, splendid! Someone needs to save it every year. For that thing to go off, it's a tremendous amount of effort, certainly. Well, as we have said before, we are Orlando and Rovias, the guardians of the Gramercy Occult Society. [dramatic music] My brother always lies, I always tell the truth. Which of us… [music stops] wait, hold on."
Kugrash: I start to walk in.
"Orlando or Rovias: Wait, hold it!"
Brennan: A few of the stairs lower.
Orlando or Rovias: We're gonna get this right one time!
[players laughing]
"Brennan: You guys descend through the staircase, walking down, crazy M.C. Escher steps and this golden, warm, brown light, the clicking of that tile, there's so much echoey goodness in this place when you're in that giant stone kind of civic building. Tick, tick, tick of your shoes on the stone. Open a pair of doors. You see Esther is here, as is Alejandro. Alejandro has his little flat cap off. You can see his sort of bald head with a little wrap around of white hair. He looks down. You see that Ana and Amelia, who both look to be in their, maybe, late teens, early 20s, sort of college age, you see that they are laid back in chairs and that they have some injuries on them and they smell strongly of mint. Strong mint smell."
"Sofia: Well, now that I'm magic, I might have some healing, so I go over to them and I lay my hands on them."
"Brennan: You see that they look up, one looks up and says,"
Ana or Amelia: [very teen girl] Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
"Sofia: Hi, Sofia Bicicleta, newly magic, experimenting with my limitations."
"Brennan: You see Alejandro looks over to you and says,"
Alejandro: She can heal people or is this?
"Kingston: No, not at all. But she helped us, so we're trying to roll her in soft."
"Ricky: She's trying. She's doing a really good job, though. I could Lay on Hands someone, for real."
"Lou: Can I come and just put an arm around her and be like,"
"Kingston: Hey, remember when you did a full flip around the Santa Claus rib? That's your shit."
Sofia: Okay. Okay.
Kingston: This is not. This is not your magic.
Sofia: I am so sorry.
"Brennan: You take the hands off of them. Kingston, you go to work on these two—"
"Kingston: You do other cool shit, I promise."
Sofia: Okay.
Kingston: I promise. I promise.
"Sofia: Okay, I'm not a healer. I have just learned, thank you."
"Brennan: You see that Ana looks over at you who's one of the twins who's on the left and goes,"
"Ana: So basically, a bunch of these fucked up Santa Clauses came out, we were on 34th Street."
"Brennan: You see Amelia goes,"
"Amelia: We're not on 34th Street. We were on 5th Avenue. But they came out,"
"Ana: Okay, but no, we were rounding the corner onto 34th Street—"
Kingston: Ladies? [beat] All we need to know is what happened.
[Emily laughs]
"Ana or Amelia: [sighs] Sorry, it's just my sister is like. [makes a “head exploding” gesture, then scoffs]"
"Kingston: No, I understand, but what happened?"
"Ana or Amelia: Well, basically, we were going on patrol 'cause we knew that the clones were gonna be out 'cause Santa kinda was happening and a bunch of these mutants came out that were not bumbling around. They charged straight for us and bit us and now it feels like my bones are turning to peppermint or something."
Lou: Mm. Do I have what I need or do I need to go back to do what I did for Pete?
Brennan: Give me a Medicine check. We'll see--
Ally: Can I?
Brennan: If you have the ability to do it now.
Ally: Can I do a check and see if I recognize any of them?
Lou: 9.
"Brennan: 9? Yeah, you need to take them to the hospital."
Lou: Okay.
"Brennan: Go ahead. Yeah, give me a flat Charisma check."
"Ally: Mm, cool. 19."
"Brennan: You see that Amelia and Ana both turn up, look at you, and their eyes go wide. You have definitely sold weed to these two many, many times. You see they go,"
"Ana or Amelia: Whoa! Oh man, who are all these new people? Are they all new to The Unsleeping City? I've never seen either of these two people before. They are both brand new, both this person and especially this person, not yet, I haven't—"
Pete: I think we've met.
The twins stare at Pete with a shocked expression.
"Pete: At a party, yeah."
Ana or Amelia: You? What?
Pete: We met at a party raising money for a political candidate.
"Brennan: You see that Alejandro looks over and says,"
Alejandro: I had no idea you two were getting involved in politics. That is so good to be civic-minded. That's incredible! Who was the candidate?
"Pete: Oh, it was someone who didn't end up going forward, which is a bummer."
"Misty: Honestly, I think politics is so important and every year I do one of those videos where I tell people to vote with a bunch of other theater people."
"Pete: Oh, people love those."
Misty: People love those videos!
"Ally: I lean into them and I'm like,"
"Pete: But we are taking donations for someone really similar and they're really good, what we've heard recently, they're really good. So it's 25 a pop. And they’ll really appreciate your support."
Alejandro: Oh you’re going around
"Ally: I was talking to Alejandro? Yeah, I was talking to Alejandro."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Alejandro: Cool, yeah, absolutely! I would be happy to donate, let me see here. Do you take Paypal, Venmo, or anything like that?"
"Pete: Yeah, I definitely take Venmo."
Ricky: I hand you $100.
Pete: Great!
Ricky: That's a lot for me.
"Pete: Thank you everyone, thanks. [laughs]"
"Brennan: You see Ana and Amelia look at you and they say,"
Ana or Amelia: Could me and my sister split a donation?
"Pete: You could, yeah. Absolutely."
Ana or Amelia: Cool.
Pete: It's definitely splittable.
Ana or Amelia: It's enough to--
Pete: I actually donated earlier this morning and then had some dumplings and it was a great choice.
Brennan: They both nod.
Sofia: I thought you smoked weed before you had the dumplings.
Pete: Hmm?
Sofia: Hmm?
"Brennan: You see that Esther crosses her arms and says,"
"Esther: This is the most poorly veiled innuendo I've ever heard in my life. Alejandro, this young man is a drug dealer."
"Brennan: You see that Alejandro says,"
Alejandro: How could you tell? It seemed like he was so civic-minded.
"Brennan: And you see she says,"
Esther: He's talking about selling weed to your granddaughters.
"Brennan: You see, he looks and says,"
"Alejandro: Well, they're adults, it's their business, no problem of mine."
Pete: Fuck yeah.
"Ricky: Esther, are you a politically-minded person? 'Cause I'm trying to get more involved."
"Esther: Yeah, yes, I'm politically-minded."
Ricky: That's awesome.
"Esther: Mostly I do a lot of canvassing for causes over candidates, generally."
Ricky: Oh!
"Esther: There's a lot of rent justice and trying to fight for neighborhoods to be preserved, things like that."
"Pete: Oh, for sure. Gentrification is ruining everything."
"Kingston: Hey, real talk."
Esther: Where do you live?
Pete: Hmm?
Esther: Where do you live?
Pete: Brooklyn.
Esther: [nodding knowingly] Nice.
"Pete: But I live in Polish Brooklyn, okay? It's fucking different."
"Kingston: Hey, real quick, I'ma go get medicine for these ladies' peppermint bones. I'll be back in 25, 30 minutes."
Pete: I'll go with you.
"Kugrash: Yeah, I'll also go with you."
Kingston: Everyone!
"Sofia: Can I casually put my hand on the other twin that I didn't touch and just try to heal real quick, again?"
Brennan: Give me a Medicine check real quick.
Emily: I got a 16.
"Brennan: A 16? You see that she goes,"
"Ana or Amelia: That's not helping, but it does feel good."
"Sofia: All right, okay. Magic of love, there's something to it."
Zac: Can I try and Lay on Hands them?
"Brennan: Yeah, got for it."
"Zac: For five points, it says I can cure disease."
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely! Ricky, you lay hands on one of them and you see that [blows raspberries] this light glows through them and you can feel the disease, the virus, being arrested in her body. It's still present there, but it looks like it's not going to spread any farther while they get to the hospital."
Zac: Cool.
"Brennan: Cool! See Alejandro says,"
"Alejandro: All right, let's get these girls to the hospital. Perhaps I can come along with you and we can discuss everything that has happened."
"Kingston: Hey, we all talk on the bus."
"Brennan: You guys leave the public library with Alejandro. You see Esther looks at Alejandro and says,"
"Esther: Al, you want me to stay here?"
"Brennan: And he says,"
"Alejandro: If you could keep an eye on the society, that would be for the best."
"Brennan: She looks at you [Ricky] and says,"
"Esther: ‘Cause you're still a little injured, right or no?"
"Zac: Yes, I guess I am."
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Esther: You all right, Ricky? You look pretty beat up."
"Ricky: Oh, you know, it's just part of the whole thing, right? [laughs] I'm a little hurt, yeah."
"Brennan: She nods and says,"
"Esther: Well, hopefully get Kingston to take care of that. I also heard that you decapitated the big guy, right?"
"Ricky: Yeah, I got kinda caught up in the situation and I killed the mutant Santa that was the biggest one, so I don't know. It was just such a threat, so just had to step in, so—"
"Ally: I'm watching because I'm just fascinated by this level of macho. And I'm just like,"
Pete: Goddamn.
"Esther: All right, well, thanks for hitting the talking points with me, Ricky. I appreciated it."
Ricky: Used two hands on it. And I jumped through the air. Clean off.
"Esther: Great! I'm gonna look after some of the goings on here. We gotta take care of the engine, so best of luck."
"Brennan: You guys head off, catch the bus as it heads uptown. As you're sitting on the bus headed back towards St. Owen's, Alejandro looks over at you and says,"
"Alejandro: Peter, Peter, it's a very—"
Ally: I take out my headphones 'cause I'm wearing them like a teen on a road trip.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Alejandro: So I took a quick arcane scan of your body and spirit before you left to deal with the menace in Times Square. This is a very special moment in the history of The Unsleeping City. Peter, you are what is known in arcane circles as a Vox Phantasmas. Do you know what this means?"
Pete: No. Fox?
"Alejandro: Vox, which is Latin for voice. And then phantasmas to mean an apparition or in this case a dream."
Pete: I'm a voice for the dreams?
Alejandro: That is correct.
Pete: I'm a dream voice.
"Alejandro: A dream voice, it's true. There are certain people within The Unsleeping City who occupy positions of important weight and gravity. Not myself. As a wizard, I have had to, cómo se dice [how do you say in Spanish], bust my ass my whole life, work very hard to study magic to get to this point, but I'm not complaining. There are certain people who are instead innately magical because of how they are born or because forces and entities speak through them. Kingston is one such person. You are another. There has not been a Vox Phantasmas in this city since, I believe, the mid-1920s. In the history of New York, there has never been a Vox Phantasmas and a Vox Ppopuli at the same time."
Pete: And a what?
Alejandro gestures to Kingston.
Kingston: I'm the Vox Populi.
Pete: What's that?
"Kingston: As it was explained to me long ago, I am the spirit, the spirits of New York City saw fit to give me the strength and powers and blessings of New York itself. I guess, 'cause I was doing my part, New York invested its energy in me, and thus I was, about 30 years ago, I don't know, able to do magic. I'm assuming, I guess, similar to what you're going through right now, I woke up one day and I could touch people and make them feel better. I didn't need any of the medicine or tools that I had spent years learning how to do the exact same thing."
"Brennan: You see that Alejandro nods and says,"
"Alejandro: New York is a place of incredible power for a number of reasons. Much of the magic of The Unsleeping City comes from the interplay between the waking world and the dreaming, what we call Nod, the Sixth Borough. The Unsleeping City is the place where those two planes touch and we find that beings from one place can enter into another. I will say as well here that there are opposing forces in certain cases. The magic of the Vox Populi comes from the power of the waking world, the places and people of New York itself. Your power does not come from that. It comes from the New York of the other side. Tell me, Peter, have you had any interactions with beings, entities, or locals that would perhaps deviate from the norm?"
Pete: No.
Alejandro: No?
Pete: Mm-mm.
Alejandro: That is highly unlikely!
"Ally: I make a look at Kingston that’s like, I'm not answering any more questions from this guy."
Sofia: You're a dodgy motherfucker.
"Misty: Young man, I think you'll find it easier around here if you just start to tell the truth."
"Kingston: Tell him, Misty."
"Misty: Because whatever shit you think that you've seen, we've seen worse, and more."
Pete: I just—
Misty: And let me tell you—
"Pete: All right, if you guys are cops, you have to tell me. Do you know that's the law? If you're cops—"
"Kugrash: Hey, I'm a rat, right?"
"Kingston: That man's a rat, we're on a magical bus, you—"
Sofia: I'm definitely not a cop. With my family—
Pete: This just feels like the most elaborate sting operation. Now you're asking me if I've ever seen anyone—
Misty: And let me tell you.
Pete: Nefarious.
"Misty: The Voice of Dreams back in the 1920s was a goddamn delight. It was so much fun, it was the 1920s, everything was roaring—"
Pete: What was that person like?
"Misty: Oh my god, so fun! Threw the most amazing parties. She was fabulous."
Pete: Huh!
"Alejandro: She was really something else, Josefina Gatsby."
"Misty: Oh, loved her."
"Alejandro: Man oh man, she was great."
"Brennan: You see that Alejandro looks at you and says,"
"Alejandro: I will tell you two things now. Number one, I promise you on my word, as a wizard and as someone who wants only the best for his city, I'm not a cop. Secondly, I watched you actively try to sell drugs to my two granddaughters not more than 10 minutes ago. So if this was a sting, probably I would have leaned into the microphone and say so by now."
"Pete: Yeah, okay."
Alejandro: Something to consider.
"Misty: Also, cops don't have to tell you they're cops."
"Alejandro: Oh, that's extremely important."
Misty: You should know that by now!
Pete: Really?
Alejandro: They really don't have to tell you.
Misty: They don't. That's stupid! It's a very stupid thing to believe.
"Pete: But then in court, it could get thrown out if they lie."
Sofia: No!
"Kugrash: Pete, just tell them the stuff, goddamn it."
"Pete: All right, fucking fine!"
Ally: I take a microdose of acid pill out of my pocket and swallow it.
"Pete: [groans] Great. All right. Yeah, okay, so I saw someone killed my dad, but not like it's a sad way, like in a good way."
Kingston: What?
"Pete: Then there was a big happy face button. Someone asked me to push it and I did and he said, ""Spread the word, I'm free."" And I think his name was… Fuck! [groans] Lazarus. He said, ""Spread the news I'm leaving today."" So whoever Lazarus is, I guess I let out [sighs] by pushing the button."
Ricky: Your dad's dead?
"Kingston: Yeah, what was that part?"
"Pete: He's a piece of shit, man."
Sofia: I mean.
Kingston: Okay.
Pete: He sucked and I guess I do kinda like feel in contact with this voice still.
Alejandro: So there is a voice in dreams that you spoke to and released from some kind of bondage.
"Pete: That's kinda what it felt like, yeah."
"Alejandro: Okay, that has the potential to be very bad."
Pete: Hm?
Alejandro: That has the potential to be very bad.
Pete: [grinning] Hm?
"Alejandro: That has the potential to be extremely bad. So what I will say to you now is this. It is important that you learn to govern these abilities. You are dealing with an extreme amount of power. That power, if wielded recklessly, could tear this city apart. So I know it is not fair to you, but you have become someone of great significance, and your decisions, should they be reckless, selfish, and dangerous, will carry an impact far greater than they would have, even a week before now."
Pete: [very quietly] Fuck. [starts to reach down to his pocket]
Alejandro: Are you about to microdose again? Does that feel responsible?
Pete takes something out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth.
"Kugrash: Pete, what are you doing?"
"Misty: I mean, at what point does a microdose—"
"Pete: It's so little, it's so little, the kind I dose."
"Sofia: I gotta say, I think that what Pete is doing, there could be some value for that. There hasn't been enough research into what—"
"Kingston: There is research out there, there's just this--"
Pete: There's research out there!
Sofia: Psychedelics would do for—
"Kugrash: It's not micro-doses if you keep taking it, right?"
Pete: It was two small micro-doses.
"Ricky: Pete, I can get you a guest pass to my gym."
Pete: What?
Ricky: We can do some sets together. We can just hit shoulders.
"Pete: I mean, I'll think about it, man, that's really nice."
Sofia: They got a spectator pass?
Kugrash: Really?
Brennan: You guys pull up to the hospital.
Ricky: I don't know!
"Brennan: You guys pull up to the hospital, you get off, Ana and Amelia walk with you. Go ahead and make some Medicine checks with advantage."
"Lou: Oh, threes."
Ally: Ohh!
"Lou: Okay, great, that's 18. Less than 18. And that's very high, it's 26 and 25, so [mumbles] 18 and—"
Brennan: 26.
"Lou: 18, 26."
"Brennan: You go ahead, you perfectly cure Ana, and then Amelia, who actually was the one who had the virus stopped, you're able to take it the rest of the way over and they are both healed."
Ally: Nice.
"Brennan: You see Alejandro looks over and says,"
Alejandro: I know we're in a hospital. Is it cool if I light up in here or no?
"Kingston: In my office, sure. Everywhere else?"
Ricky: I'd actually prefer you not.
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: He nods. You see he takes this old, crazy wooden pipe and puts it back in his coat."
Ally: I hand him a Juul.
"Pete: Here you go, man."
Alejandro: What is this? What am I looking at right now?
"Pete: It's an e-cigarette, you can plug it into your computer. That one is cucumber habanero flavored. [smoke sizzling] It's just like a tobacco pipe, my brother."
"Alejandro: [blows out] Peter, this is extremely rad. Can I buy this from you or I can just get this anywhere?"
"Pete: You can have it, man. If you need a re-up, though, then you gotta pay."
"Alejandro: Peter, you are an extremely cool dude and I very much appreciate that you have given me this gift."
Pete: Thanks.
Alejandro: Know this.
"[quiet, dramatic music]"
"Brennan: You see that one of his eyes turns into a golden point of light and you see that in a mirror, his reflections begin to double up and extend infinitely away. He says,"
Alejandro: Do not take it lightly that a wizard is in your debt. Call my name thrice and I shall appear in a moment of need for you.
"Pete: [very quietly] Wait, I'm so sorry but as a Lady Gaga fan, I might accidentally say Alejandro multiple times, and I'm not calling you."
"Alejandro: Okay, if you do it to the tune of the Lady Gaga song, I will know not to come."
"Pete: Ale-Alejandro, okay, great, cool. All right, good, good, good! I'm just double-checking."
"Alejandro: Oh, for sure. It's not like I'm bound by this. Just that I have a thing in my office where if someone says my name, a little wisp of smoke goes into a glass bulb."
"Pete: Oh, cool!"
"Alejandro: So really, it would be cooler to say it's just magic where I just appear, but it's actually I just see it and then I teleport there."
"Pete: That's really generous, man."
Alejandro: No problem!
Pete: Thank you so much. Put it in.
"Brennan: He says,"
"Alejandro: Oh Peter, come here! I don't know why I'm giving my tricks away. I should not do this. This thing, this is crazy, and it has a kick to it, a flavor!"
Pete: Isn't it nice? Yeah!
Alejandro: The flavor is not a bad part of it.
Pete: Do you have a phone? Put my number in. You can hit me up anytime for anything.
Kingston: Alejandro!
"Alejandro: Sorry, I'm sorry."
"Kingston: What are you doing, man? You're a grown ass man."
Alejandro: Don't talk to me about a grown ass man.
"Kingston: No, you a grown ass man, then why you acting—"
Alejandro: I'm old enough to be your father. I don't need you to tell my business. I can't have a good time with the young man?
"Kingston: No, you know what I mean? You don't need some kid's number to buy drugs, man!"
"Alejandro: Kingston! All right, look, thank you very much for this Juul."
Pete: Thank you.
"Alejandro: I will treasure it forever, I am in your debt. [puts it away]"
Pete: Well.
"Brennan: He says,"
"Alejandro: Now, there is something very sinister at work. The Dream Realm is an area which even for the wizards of the Gramercy Occult Society exists outside of their realm of knowledge. We know a fraction of what there is to know about the Dream Realm. We have hardly enough time as it is simply to map out The Unsleeping City, and those things which are able to issue forth from the Dream Realm into the waking world. The actual Dream Realm itself is far beyond our understanding. However, there are things there vaster and more potent than I can describe in words. And if you have already engaged in powerful magics there as the Vox Phantasmas, then it is hard to say what may have happened. How did you come to know this being was released? I can see on your bracelet that that is a source of your power, so if you were to press that brace—"
"Pete: That's exactly what happened. Yeah, I saw a gold rectangle appear and then I was able to push this button to release. They asked me if I wanted to, and I did want to."
Alejandro: [frowns] A gold rectangle. And that is when the voice started to speak to you?
Pete: Yeah.
Alejandro: It was the same voice the whole time or different voices?
"Pete: Felt like different voices, maybe."
Alejandro: Okay.
Pete: There was a gray baby.
Alejandro: A gray baby?
Pete: Mm-hm.
Alejandro: [intensely] A gray baby. A gray baby.
"Pete: It's starting to lose all meaning, those words are—"
Ricky: [crosstalk] Gray baby.
"Pete: [crosstalk] Gray baby, gray baby."
"Alejandro: A gray baby? Interesante [interesting in Spanish], okay, hold on."
"Pete: Gray baby, gray baby."
"Alejandro: I am going to, this requires, I don't the book is still at our main chapter, but maybe out at the Clinton Hill Chantry or somewhere else. I must go! [taps table]"
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Alejandro: Ana, Amelia, you guys need cab fare?"
"Brennan: And you see that they look and they say,"
"Ana or Amelia: Grandpa, it's Lyft now or Uber or we'll just take a fucking subway."
"Alejandro: Okay, I can give you cash if you need it. I just care about your safety because today you almost died. [kisses] My granddaughters, mijas! All right, I'm going to head out."
[teleportation sound]
Brennan: And a bunch of—
Ricky: Did he say he's going to Hell?
Kingston: He's heading out.
Misty: He's head out.
Ricky: Oh.
"Sofia: Oh, I heard Hell, too."
"Brennan: Ana and Amelia say,"
"Ana or Amelia: Kingston, thank you so much."
Kingston: Of course.
"Ana or Amelia: Appreciate it. Well, listen, do you need anything from us before we head out? 'Cause we can redo some of the enchantments on your nurse's office or if you need anything else."
"Kingston: That would be lovely, but if you guys got places to go, I can happily handle it."
"Brennan: You see that one of them is on their phone already clicking. You see the other one begins to [magic noise] cast some enchantments that, again, all have. You see these circular gyroscoping images of light that look like New York City manhole cover made out of green and orange neon light begin to [magical music] go into the walls all around your nurse's office. She says,"
"Ana or Amelia: Cool, that should do it. Thanks Kingston, bye!"
Kingston: Thank you so much.
"Sofia: Oh, before you guys leave, you two are just so cute. If you ever want a haircut or anything, and I give them a business card."
Ally: Aww!
"Brennan: They look, go ahead and make a little Persuasion roll for me."
"Sofia: Well, it's on the house."
Emily: But that is a 12.
"Brennan: A 12! You see they look and so they say,"
"Ana or Amelia: Oh, that'd be fun. On the house? Sure! Your hair looks awesome."
Sofia: Thank you.
Ana or Amelia: Where is your haircut place?
Sofia: It's on Staten Island.
"Ana or Amelia: Okay, have a good one!"
Sofia: It's just a ferry ride away.
Ana or Amelia: Bye!
Sofia: They have beers on the ferry.
"Ana or Amelia: 'Kay, 'kay! Lovely to meet you!"
Sofia: Okay.
Brennan: So they head out.
"Sofia: All right. We're gonna get a subway stop one of these days, I'm sure of it."
"Brennan: Great! And it's just you guys left here, that are left here in Kingston's office."
"Kingston: Well, well, well."
Misty: Just like old times.
"Kingston: I'll tell ya, Vox Phantasma."
"Pete: Yeah, sorry to be such a dick about it. There's a lotta cops after me, and I move a lot of product through the city, so I didn't wanna be taken down, you know."
Kingston: Hmm.
Ricky: Hmm.
"Kugrash: I think you're cool. I think you don't really have to worry about, you have magic now, so you're cool."
"Pete: Yeah, I wasn't sure."
"Ally: [laughing] I hand you like, four Xanax."
"Kingston: Okay, stop giving people drugs."
Misty: I mean I will take some Xanax if they're going.
Pete: There you go!
"Kugrash: I weigh like, this will kill me This absolutely will kill me, please take this back."
"Pete: Ah, okay!"
"Kugrash: Hey please, I'm a tiny rat."
Ricky: Do you have a place to stay?
"Pete: Yeah, yeah, I got a house and everything."
Ricky: Okay. Good.
Pete: Fuck! [quietly] I may have been kicked out of my house.
"Sofia: Well, if anyone needs a place to stay, I'm but a ferry ride away."
Pete: [to Ricky] So where do you live?
Ricky: I am in a studio apartment in Brooklyn.
"Pete: Oh, sick."
"Kingston: Pete, I have another bedroom. If you'd like to stay with me, that's also an option."
"Pete: Ooh, yeah. A lotta options, you guys."
Sofia: I have a whole house.
Kingston: Oh!
Pete: Whoa.
Sofia: On Staten Island.
"Pete: Ah, okay, [to Kugrash] so where do you live?"
Kingston: Every time.
Kugrash: I live in the subway tunnels. If you wanna curl up in a—
Pete: That’s man...
Siobhan: I just get very quiet and edge away from this conversation because I definitely don't want Pete staying with me.
Sofia: It's a guest bedroom with a California king.
Kingston: That is all lovely.
Pete: That's really nice.
Ricky: I guess I'm on fireman time is the other thing you should know. I'm waking up pretty early and as soon as I leave the house--
"Pete: Yeah, Kingston, it would be really cool to crash with you maybe."
Kingston: We can work something out.
Sofia: Private bathroom for the guest room.
"Pete: Oh, that's pretty cool."
Sofia: On Staten Island.
"Pete: Hey, Kingston, when can I move in?"
"Kingston: Okay, moving in is a strong word. You can stay with me until we figure something else out."
"Kugrash: All right, why don't we all meet at Kingston's apartment tomorrow morning?"
Kingston: Great.
Sofia: Okay.
Kingston: Everybody can come on over here.
Kugrash: Headquarters.
"Kingston: Great, I'm on the top floor. You guys say hello to my mother on the way up, all right?"
Kugrash: Okay.
Sofia: Okay.
Kingston: Do you know what I mean? Have manners.
Misty: I love visiting Kingston 'cause there's this little place that does cafe con leche for 75 cents!
"Pete: Oh, really?"
Kingston: That's fantastic.
"Misty: Down on the bodega on the corner, oh!"
Pete: That's what living in New York's all about.
Misty: All about it!
"Pete: It's crazy when you can get coffee for less than a dollar. I mean, honestly."
Misty: Less than a dollar! It's beautiful condensed milk and espresso. Mm!
"Brennan: Wonderful! While you guys take off from there, going to your various places, let's go around. You've had this weird meeting of all these different various forces at work and it's sort of come together and it seems like some momentous things are underway. We'll just go around the table. Ricky, what does Ricky do as he leaves from there? Where is he headed to?"
Zac: Ricky's just going home. He's gotta get a good eight hours in. This hasn't registered to him that this is anything that crazy.
Brennan: Anything special.
"Zac: Made some new friends today, cool, and then jogged home."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you jog home. In your studio, you have all your jam and workout equipment in there, do a couple quick reps. You get a little message as you do every single night, from your mom and dad saying, sending our love, hope you had another great day, saw you on the news, love our boy."
"Zac: Text them a picture of me working out. No days off, love you, Mom and Dad."
"Ally: [laughing] No days off, you fucker!"
"Brennan: You get a text back of your mom way in the foreground with her face kind of clipped off going like, [screams] and your dad completely in a newspaper not looking, and she says the text under it is, ""Your dad says 'Wow, so strong!'"" Heart eyes, heart eyes, heart eyes."
Ricky: Sounds like Dad. [grunts as he lifts a weight]
Brennan: Where does Sofia head off to?
"Emily: Okay, well, Sofia is heading back to Staten Island, but the looming disappointment of her very empty, once marital bed is haunting her, and so she immediately turns back around and she goes,"
"Sofia: Kug, do you wanna grab a drink or something? Also, I've got an amazing detangler. Let me at your fur, it's all matted and destroyed."
"Kugrash: Yeah, yeah, yeah I kinda like it like this. Are you sure if you wanna?"
"Sofia: Yeah, I think so."
Emily: And then I think I just wanna work on Kugrash's fur and give him a little styling.
Ally: You're gonna straighten Kugrash's fur.
Brennan: So you guys are in a speakeasy around the corner and you're chemically de-tangling.
Murph: Do I just look like a little ugly dude to non-magic people?
Brennan: I'm gonna actually ask you to roll a Charisma check.
Murph: I might just look like a rat.
Brennan: Roll a Charisma check.
Murph: I've gotta try to not look like a rat.
Ally: You have negative Charisma!
"Murph: Oh, I'm so bad at Charisma! I rolled a 13 but I have negative two, I got an 11."
"Brennan: 11, okay! So you're there de-tangling this rat's fur."
Emily: But also giving it some volume.
Siobhan: Tease it a little bit.
Brennan: Kugrash...
Kugrash: It feels good.
"Brennan: You look in the mirror, you're starting to look like a full chinchilla. You're just so poofy. You see that a maitre d' walks over, this is a restaurant and bar, walks over and says,"
"Maitre D’: [soft voice] Hi, ma'am, I've never had to do this before."
"Sofia: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not interested. I know what you're going after and I'm not married, but I was recently, so I still kind of consider myself married. I'm so sorry."
Maitre D’: In no world could that have been what I was going for.
Murph: I try to start dancing.
Ally: [laughing] What?
"Murph: As a rat, like I'm a trick rat."
"Brennan: You don't know what you look like right at this moment and you see that the person looks down at you and says,"
"Maitre D’: Ma'am, you have to understand how far it has gotten for me to say this."
Emily: Do I see him dancing?
"Brennan: You see him dancing as Kugrash. But you see that the guy looks at you and says,"
Maitre D’: Your baby is so hairy that it is—
Murph: Oh my god.
Maitre D’: Upsetting other customers and I'm going to have to ask you to take your child out of the bar.
"Sofia: Oh my god, seriously? You're gonna be against children? God, new mothers just can't go anywhere."
"Maitre D’: Your baby's covered in hair and everyone's upset. I need you to… We're gonna comp your drink, so your drink is on us, but you need to take your baby—"
"Kugrash: Free drinks, get one more! Get one more for me and then let's go."
"Sofia: For one more drink, I'll leave."
"Maitre D’: Okay, we're gonna do that."
Sofia: Okay. [laughs]
"Kugrash: Yeah, right!"
Brennan: You get a little to-go coffee cup of the alcoholic drink.
Kugrash: This is a good scam!
"Sofia: I know, Kug."
"Kugrash: You go in there, you got a hairy baby, people don't want to ask you to leave, you get."
Sofia: I think we gotta run this scam on a couple more bars.
"Brennan: You guys end up running that scam. Make an Insight check, Kugrash."
Murph: Okay. 22.
"Brennan: 22, you can tell after the third bar you guys run hairy baby on—"
Sofia: This is the best night.
Brennan: You can tell that Sofia's trying to not go home.
Murph: Oh.
"Sofia: Okay, where to next?"
"Kugrash: You know what? [finger guns] Let's go to Staten Island, huh? You got a basement I can curl up in, like a dirty rag or something?"
"Sofia: No, you know what? You can sleep in my bed and I'll sleep in the guest room."
"Kugrash: Yeah, all right."
"Sofia: Okay, yeah."
"Brennan: You guys toddle off. You're blasted, Sofia. You guys wander—"
Ally: Now you're dancing.
Brennan: Through the park.
Ally and Emily are both doing some kind of strange hand dance.
"Emily: What was the dance you were doing, Murph?"
Murph and Siobhan both do an odd little hand dance at waist level.
"Brennan: Go ahead and make me a Constitution saving throw, real quick."
Emily: Okay.
Lou: Oh shit.
"Murph: Me too or just her? Oh, she's drunk."
Brennan: Yeah.
Emily: That's gonna be 17.
"Brennan: Hey, you're feelin’ great, you're all right. You're just a little tipsy. You guys are wandering through Central Park at night, snow kinda kicking around again. You get to a certain point, and are you still wearing your plastic bag shoes or did—"
Emily: Have I seen any shoes on the street?
Brennan: Go ahead and make a Investigate.
"Murph: Yeah, I'll look around for shoes, too."
Brennan: Make an Investigate check.
Murph: I'll crawl in some dumpsters.
Brennan: Oh!
Murph: I got a 19.
Emily: I got 12.
"Brennan: You got 19, Kug knows where to look for 'em, so on your way through the park, you look around and you find the boathouse has some lockers in it where people keep shoes sometimes, and the lockers are very, very old. So on the way through the park, you [metal thuds] bust into one of the lockers and there's a little pair of just some comfy loafers."
"Sofia: I think no, I'll just stick with the plastic bags."
"Kugrash: Eh, they're rich people, they're fucking loafers."
"Sofia: I know, but they’re not very— but I go for a little more flair in the way I decorate myself. Thank you, though, I really appreciate it."
"Kugrash: All right, yeah."
"Brennan: You guys wander away from the boathouse and you guys actually end up crossing through Bethesda Fountain, which is known as the giant fountain in Central Park right next to the lake with this giant statue of an angel. It's a beautiful angel in Central Park. You're walking through. Each of you guys make a Wisdom check. A Wisdom check."
Murph: 14.
Emily: 6!
"Brennan: The tipsiness kind of hits you a little more, Sofia. You look up and are entranced by this angel. She's just so beautiful to you."
"Sofia: God, that's a nice figure."
"Brennan: The head of the angel [stone grinding] turns to look at you and says,"
Em: [heavy New York accent] You're not so bad yourself.
"Sofia: Oh my god, being magic is awesome. Hi, I'm Sofia Bicicleta."
Emily: I hold out my hand to it.
"Brennan: The snows swirls around in the moonlight and the angel soars down on wings and as she lands, boom! You see she's made of metal. You see she says,"
"Em: Charmed, I'm the Angel of the Waters. You can call me Em."
"Sofia: Oh, hi Em, nice to meet you."
"Em: So what, bags are in now?"
"Sofia: [chuckles] Well, it was this or loafers."
"Em: Oh god, loafers in the middle of winter?"
Sofia: I know. I know.
"Em: What is this? What are we, in The Hamptons or something? Give me a break."
Sofia: I know. I don't need yacht slippers.
"Em: No yacht fashion, thank you."
Sofia: No thank you.
"Brennan: You see she looks down and says,"
"Em: Kugrash, I don't know if we've formally met, but you do really good work around here in the Park."
"Kugrash: Oh, thanks, yeah. It's good seeing you. Did you happen to see anything weird going on in the park tonight, y’know, what with the Santa being kidnapped and all?"
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Em: Oh God, I heard about that yesterday. Yeah, that's awful. Well, I'm pretty stationary as far as things go. I have to guard these waters or all hell breaks loose. But I did hear, it's interesting about the pixies. I heard a rumor going around that it was them or something like that. But I will say that seems a little odd cause Don Confetti's daughter is getting married. So it seems like—"
Sofia: Oh! So why would they be dabbling in some sort of—
"Em: Seems like it's being stretched pretty thin, I don't know. I mean, maybe it's a perfect time for him to get up to some trouble or something."
Sofia: Have you not heard—
Kugrash: Who's she getting married to?
Em: Some pigeon.
"Kugrash: Pigeon. Oh, [sighs] These pixies are gettin' fancy. A real rat bird, huh?"
Sofia: Have you ever heard of pixies getting involved with the infernal?
Em: The infernal?
Sofia: Yeah!
"Em: These pixies? No, Don Confetti's a fucking idiot. I don't think he has the smarts to tangle with any kinda real envoy of Hell or anything like that. Hey, if it was gonna happen anywhere, it would happen here, right?"
"Sofia: Mm, yeah, I guess that's true."
Kugrash: Do you— are people— Is this an actual pigeon that she's marrying?
"Em: Yeah, Ronald Pigeon."
Kugrash: Ronald Pigeon.
Sofia: Maybe he's trying to ruin the wedding?
Murph: Do I know if Ronald's a shithead or if Ronald's a good pigeon?
Brennan: Make a Nature check for me.
Murph: Okay.
Sofia: When is their marriage?
Murph: 13.
Brennan: 13. Most pigeons are exactly the same level of stupid.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: And Ronald Pigeon just comes from a good pigeon family.
Sofia: So is this an alliance?
Kugrash: And he comes from good stock.
Sofia: Is this a political marriage? Are the pixies trying to make an alliance with the pigeons?
"Em: Honestly, I don't think so. The pigeons don't really have—"
"Sofia: So you think it's true love. They just really love each other and outside, they're just marrying outside of the family."
"Em: I think they're just marrying outside of the family. It's also his youngest daughter, so I think that she has a little more—"
"Sofia: Okay, it's not as much pressure."
"Em: Not as much pressure as her older sisters. It is what it is. Well, listen, it was lovely seeing you here."
"Sofia: Yeah! It's nice to meet you. My friends call me Sofia Bikes, so if you wanna say that, you can."
"Em: Sofia Bikes, well, you can call me Em, as I've said. Nice to meet you, Sofia Bikes. You want some water on your way home?"
"Sofia: Yes, that would be wonderful."
"Brennan: You see that she holds a hand up to the fountain, which has been shut off for the winter, and some of the water comes out into her hand and she holds it out and it holds its shape as though there is a cup or bowl there, and pours it into your hand, and it holds the same shape as though held there by some invisible force."
Emily: I marvel at it and then I throw it back like a shot.
Kugrash: Do you mind if I take a quick bath in this?
"Brennan: Oh, she says—"
"Sofia: [upset] Oh, I just did your hair."
"Kugrash: Nevermind, I'll just have a little drink."
"Brennan: She gives you a drink, as well. You guys are healed all the rest of any hit point damage you had left over."
"Murph: Oh, nice."
"Brennan: And the water also, you see that actually even just drinking the water, a lot of the dirt and grime comes off of you. For you as well, it feels like this weird, purifying thing where a lot of your drunkenness leaves you. It almost sobers you up a little bit, but it doesn't leave you feeling anxious or edgy again. It leaves you feeling a little bit clear but solid like you're anchored to something."
"Sofia: Em, do you mind if I take a flask of this?"
"Brennan: She says,"
"Em: Oh, this is pretty potent stuff, but of course, [winks] I'll do it for you."
Sofia: Thank you.
Brennan: You see she pours some into your--
Emily: I take out one of those tiny nips of Smirnoff Ice. I dump out the Smirnoff Ice and then.
"Brennan: Some of the water goes into it and she says,"
"Em: All right doll, take care of yourself. It's a long ferry ride back."
Sofia: Eh. [shakes her head]
"Brennan: And she flies back up to her stance, goes back into her stance, and the snow begins to collect on her wings again. Wonderful! What's Kingston doing?"
Lou: I guess me and Pete are together on the bus. We're on the bus going back to my apartment building.
"Brennan: Cool, you get on the bus. You head back to Kingston's apartment. You walk up the steps."
Lou: What time is it?
Brennan: It's about 11:30 at night. Your folks are probably asleep.
"Lou: Yeah, great."
"Brennan: Probably Claude and his family's asleep, as well. But you guys get up into Kingston's apartment. Kingston's apartment is lovely. It has that rich smell of cool old antiques and good books and a lot of coffee grounds. All those kind of musky, deep smell that immediately you're like, oh, I'm in someone's nice home."
"Ally: I love this shit. But I'm standing like this [puts their hands in their pockets] the whole time, like awkward."
"Kingston: Hey, you want a glass of water or something?"
"Pete: Yeah, sure."
"Kingston: All right, word."
Lou: Can I put on just a jazz record and get him a glass of water?
"Brennan: You see a for real old vinyl starts playing some great fucking jazz. Go ahead, actually, and Kingston, give me a Medicine check."
Lou: 24.
"Brennan: Kingston's mere presence, glass of water is great, New York tap water. Best tap water in The USA, by the way. And the music playing, you feel yourself. Pete has whatever reservations he has, but physically you feel your body relaxing a little bit."
Ally: Cool.
[soft jazz music]
"Kingston: Wild day, right?"
"Pete: [takes a drink] Yeah, that was crazy."
"Ally: I think I'm texting my guy. I'm just letting him know that I was kicked out of my old place, but there wasn't anything there."
"Brennan: You get a text immediately back saying, Copy. Come to my place to re- up. One time thing while you're figuring shit out."
"Ally: Okay, cool."
"Kingston: All right, you're gonna be stayin' in the master bedroom."
Pete: Why?
"Kingston: Honestly, I sleep in the guest bedroom now, so you'll be in the master."
"Pete: All right, thanks."
"Kingston: All good, man."
"Lou: And I go, can I just do classic host stuff and just get towels?"
"Ally: Oh, this is making me feel so awkward. I'm just like, thanks so much!"
"Lou: A bunch of travel-sized one soap, one shampoo."
"Pete: Oh, that is so nice, thanks so much."
"Kingston: Of course, man. Whatever you need until you get on your feet."
"Pete: Ah yeah, thanks, thanks again."
"Kingston: Just be kind to my family, and if I catch you sellin' any drugs to my cousins or my parents or my other cousins..."
Pete: Okay.
Kingston: We're gonna have a problem.
"Pete: Okay, all right, all right, all right, oh yeah, yeah."
Kingston: We're gonna have a big-ass problem. We're gonna have a huge-ass problem—
Pete: I get it!
Kingston: From which we cannot come back.
Pete: I just wanna say I don't create the desire in other people. What you should be worried about is the desire that is there already.
"Kingston: Well, let me tell you something right now, dawg, all right? The desire is not there. If for some reason you enter the home and create the desire, we gon' have a problem."
"Brennan: You see as you guys have this little interaction, there's a cool little piece of art on the wall that has some mirror or reflective stuff in it. You see the kind of soft, golden light and sort of rainbow light in a corner of it,"
[ethereal music]
Brennan: Create a little bit of sparks and you guys hear a loud noise as the painting rattles and falls off the wall.
"Kingston: Man, this is that same old bullshit, us two being two Voxes here at the same time. Man, we need to figure this shit out."
"Pete: All right, yeah, yeah. I won't sell anyone in your house drugs. I’m not gonna— I really won't."
Kingston: Thank you.
Pete: I won't.
Ally: I take out a bunch of little holders and vials and stuff that I just have on my own.
Pete: This is just my own supply.
"Kingston: Goddamn, Pete. How are you standing up?"
Pete: It's like a mixologist. You're just constantly re-navigating where you're at.
"Kingston: I tell you, I did dope one time in 1978. It was the craziest thing that ever happened. You know what? Whatever. I'm going to bed. Good night, Pete."
"Brennan: Kingston goes off to bed. You're just kinda kicking it, waiting to--"
"Ally: I'm gonna be awake for five more hours. Sitting there, I'm just like."
Brennan: You look around. What's Pete doing awake at Kingston's apartment?
"Ally: I'm trying not to go through anything. I am trying to be a good guest, so I'm just kinda like. [staring around]"
Brennan: Give me a Perception check.
"Ally: Yeah, cool. Nat 20."
Brennan: Nat 20!
[Emily cheers]
"[gentle, slightly mysterious music]"
"Brennan: You see on top of the refrigerator, just a little light layer of dust on it, there's a big glass vase full of corks. There's some takeout menus. You also see that wrapped in ancient, stinking gauze is an obsidian ankh, this old Egyptian symbol of life. You immediately pick up some weird magical sensations from it. You see that it's under a clear salad bowl, so it's like there's a salad bowl was put on top of it. And you see that there's also what looks like a framed photograph that's fallen down onto the face of the photograph, so that you can't see what the photo is."
"Ally: Okay, I lift that up, I gotta look at it."
"Brennan: You see there is a young Kingston Brown. His dreads not yet silvery white, but instead sort of salt and pepper. [looks to Lou] Clean shaven."
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see that there is a younger Hispanic woman in her 30s, beautiful, classic high cheekbones. You see that there are wedding rings on their fingers and that they are standing in front of City Hall."
Ally: She's pretty cute. I feel sad. [laughing]
"Brennan: Yeah! Wonderful! Misty, you get back to your lovely penthouse. There's some notes, some sticky notes left from Alissa, there's one big one on your kitchen table. I assume you're going back to your penthouse, by the way."
"Misty: It's Monday, we're dark on Mondays, it's fine!"
"Brennan: And you see that there is an invitation that has been on your to-do list for a little while. You've frankly forgotten about it, but there's a little Post-it saying, ""Last day to RSVP."" highlighted by Alissa. In little birch bark and ivy leaves is an invitation to the wedding of Angela Confetti and Ronald Pigeon."
Lou laughs. Ally shakes their head.
"Siobhan: Well, I don't super wanna go, but also the Confettis are one of those crime families that also are great supporters of the arts. They're like, oh, it's my cousin's birthday. We're gonna bring five incredible Broadway stars and have them sing at the birthday. As patrons of the arts, I have to go to this wedding."
Brennan: There you go.
Siobhan: And so I RSVP yes in my most beautiful [writing massive loops] purple ink calligraphy.
"Brennan: You see that as you RSVP, the invitation [chitters] turns into this little twig blight and goes [chitters]."
"Misty: Go on, go along!"
"Brennan: You see it runs and hits its head into your door. Backs up, runs, bam, head again."
Siobhan: I open the door.
"Misty: You're stupid, go through the doors!"
Twig Blight: Thank you!
"Brennan: And [blows raspberries] takes off running down the hall. Lovely. You guys all variously go to sleep that night. The only person that I wanna cover what happens when they're asleep is Pete. Pete, you crash in the master bedroom, a big wide bed in Kingston's apartment, and you come to..."
[ethereal music]
"Brennan: ...floating above the dream-like city of New York. The skyscrapers and buildings are all a polished dark glass, like a window looking into an empty night sky with the reflections of the starlight above them as the snow drifts up off the ground going into the sky surround you. You feel weightless here, as though you could swim around or move in any direction."
Ally: I think I… I think I go to Priya's house.
"Brennan: You swim through the dreaming of New York and you arrive right near Union Square, sort of close to StuyTown and you see a gorgeous, opulent apartment all done in this illuminated nighttime glass, and you see that there is a little bubble, something imperceptible, flashes of light and color, and you get the sensation that Priya is dreaming in that room."
"Ally: Cool. I know I shouldn't do this, but I just go anyway. I try to look in at the dream."
[water bubbling]
"Brennan: You pop your head in and you see that there is a tea party on top of a clock in a strange dark forest and you see that Priya is talking to a fractured man as she's sitting at this little tea table. She looks gorgeous, by the way. You see that she looks up and says,"
"Priya: [British accent, a little posh] Well, the collection didn't meet my standards, at lease for myself, and I think that oftentimes, we find ourselves trying to create a body of work or find a theme or a central thread through something, we end up elaborating on subconscious ideologies. Culture works on us in ways that we can't even quite estimate or imagine from our conscious mind."
"Brennan: And you see that she's just talking to this fractured man, this babble of stuff about her art and what she's working on. Go ahead and make a stealth check for me if you'd be so kind."
Ally: [chuckles] Okay. Let's see. That's 13.
"Brennan: She looks up. She looks at you and she says,"
"Priya: Peter, what are you doing here?"
Pete: What?
"Priya: Peter, have you come back to help me? Well, it all feels so strange."
"Brennan: You lose your grip on the outside dreaming world and are now just in this forest. The clock starts ticking underneath the tea table. You see that the fractured man gets up,"
[water rushing]
"Brennan: And takes a little top hat and cane, and starts dancing very slowly."
Ally: I've made a mistake.
Priya: Peter!
Pete: Hmm?
Priya: [confused] My goodness.
Pete: How are you?
"Priya: How am I? How am I? It's so funny you ask that. I don't think any of us ever really knows how we are or if we do, it's a narrative we're projecting."
Ally: I run. [laughs] I run through the forest.
Brennan: You run through the forest and you see that the slow dancing man starts dancing after you.
"[slow waltz music, clockwork ticking]"
Ally: Jesus Christ.
Brennan: And he tries to—
[Ally screams]
Brennan: Cool!
Ally: No!
"Brennan: Go ahead and make a wild magic surge for me, if you'd be so kind."
"Ally: Oh, great! That's just a D20?"
"Brennan: D20, yep."
Ally: Eight.
"Brennan: Eight, cool. You snap awake in the master bed, not having blown up or anything, but you are covered in a cold sweat."
Ally: [sighs] I get up and I start doing some pushups on the ground.
"Brennan: [laughs] Wonderful! The next morning at Kingston's apartment, you guys begin to arrive there the following morning. You see that there is a small chair on the second landing of the building that has a little sign out. The sign says, “Gone to church. Help yourself to a cinnamon bun.” And you see that there is a big plate of fresh-made cinnamon buns steaming as you guys arrive there on the landing."
"Murph: I touch all of them, just looking through for the best one."
Kugrash: I gotta find the goopiest one.
"Sofia: No, no, no Kug, just take the top one."
"Kugrash: [laughs] All right. I'll take the one at the bottom, it's good."
"Murph: I Jenga it, pull it through."
"Pete: Oh, gross!"
Emily: I pick all of the rat hair off of mine.
"Zac: I come up just after them like,"
"Ricky: Oh, cool. [eats it without question]"
Murph: It's just a full mound of rat hair.
Brennan: You guys find yourself in Kingston's apartment.
Lou: What does Kugrash look like right now?
"Sofia: He looks great, I styled him this morning."
"Brennan: He looks like full chinchilla. He's the poofiest rat. He's almost spherical, he's so poofy."
Murph: I act like nothing's changed.
"Kugrash: What's up, guys? How's everybody doing this morning?"
"Misty: Kugrash, darling, you look fabulous!"
"Kingston: Honestly, Kugrash, this is my favorite look you've had."
Kugrash: Really?
"Kingston: Yeah. I think it's the second look you've had, but I'm into it."
"Kugrash: Oh. Hey, thank Sofie, it's her work."
"Sofia: Oh, I wasn't gonna take credit, but yes I did do it."
Pete: Wow!
Sofia: But I had a good canvas to work with.
Kingston: All right!
Murph: And I do my dance again. [strange little leprechaun dance]
Sofia: That gets us free drinks.
Pete: What are you doing?
Sofia: We get free drinks when he does that.
Ricky: You look like a hairy baby.
Kugrash: So we talked to the fountain.
"Sofia: Yeah, I was gonna say, does anyone know? Don Confetti, that pixie, his daughter is getting married to a pigeon."
Kingston: Ooh!
Pete: Ugh.
"Kugrash: Ronald Pigeon, good stock, good pigeon family."
"Misty: Oh, I guess, I just RSVPd to the wedding last night."
Kingston: Oh!
Pete: Good going!
Sofia: How many plus ones do you get?
"Misty: Yes, I love a wedding!"
Kugrash: So we're going with you.
"Misty: Oh, I don't know."
Kingston: We're going to the wedding?
Ricky: You have plus five?
"Kugrash: If Misty's going, we're all going, right?"
Misty: I don't think I have plus five. That's seems like an insane—
"Kugrash: I could just fit in your bag, right?"
Sofia: I'm sure I could be your stylist or something like that.
Misty: I do need a stylist.
Kingston: When is the wedding?
Siobhan: When is the wedding?
Brennan: The wedding is tonight.
Misty: The wedding's tonight! I RSVPd for a wedding that is tonight. I am an asshole.
"Pete: Oh wait, I have been getting hit up so much. Where is this wedding?"
"Misty: Oh, it's in Central Park. It's at the boathouse."
"Siobhan: [looks to Brennan] Is it the boathouse, is it really?"
Brennan: It's actually in the Ramble near Belvedere Castle.
"Misty: Oh, great."
Brennan: Which is right near—
"Misty: Oh, beautiful! It's at the Ramble."
Pete: Okay. I've been getting hit up non-stop by people who want coke for this wedding. So I was gonna be there already.
"Kingston: Not to slow it down, but we're just gonna run up in the pixie mafia's wedding? Is that our plan?"
Kugrash: I can probably talk to some pigeons and maybe get us invited by some lonely pigeons—
Sofia: Oh!
Kugrash: If you'd like to be a date.
Sofia: That's a good idea.
Kingston: Two more pigeons?
Ricky: The plus ones of a bunch of pigeons?
"Kingston: Oh yeah, I'm not gonna—"
Sofia: [waving excitedly] I wanna be a pigeon's plus one!
"Kingston: I will say, though, the markings from the pixies, they're really the only thing we've got to go on right now, but running up in a mafia's wedding is not a good way to get answers. It's a good way to get hurt, it's a good way to get the shit kicked out of you."
"Misty: I agree. Don Confetti is a sweetheart, but he will kill you, and all of your family."
Sofia: But that's why we just go with the pigeons.
"Kugrash: We're just gonna go with the pigeons. We just get a pigeon date. I'm gonna go out and find some pigeons, see if there's any horny pigeons out there."
"Kingston: You know Kug, you've had crazier plans. Let's do this."
"Murph: I have my Spirit Totems as a Circle of Shepherd. Normally, I think it's bear, hawk, and unicorn, but mine are juicy cockroach, spicy pigeon, and unicorn. I would like to use a spicy pigeon Aura and then just see if I can find any pigeons."
"Brennan: Cool! You have to go over to the window of Kingston's apartment. You guys see that Kugrash spreads his little rat arms and before you hear anything, the street darkens and you see people go,"
"Pedestrian: Ah, get outta here!"
Brennan: And start running down the street.
[pigeon coos and flying noises]
Lou: Are they coming into my house?
Brennan: Like a fucking fire hazard.
"Kingston: No, no, Kugrash! No!"
"Kugrash: I come, I summon the spirit of a spicy pigeon."
[Brennan cooing]
Kingston: Oh my God.
"Kugrash: Pigeons, come to me, my babies."
Ricky: Did you say spicy?
Ally: I'm helping you shoo them off furniture.
"Lou: Yeah, I grab a couple--"
Pete: But you're like--
"Kugrash: Hey, hey, these are gonna--"
"Emily: I'm in the bathroom touching up my makeup, so I can be a pigeon plus one."
Brennan: You hear a very gentle knock on the bathroom door.
[door creaks]
Brennan: You open the door.
[door explodes]
[bird squawking]
"Kingston: Kug, what the--"
"Kugrash: All right, is anyone here from the pigeon family? Is anyone here related to Ronald Pigeon?"
"Pigeons: [pigeon coos] I’m related, oh I’m related..."
Kugrash: Is anyone looking for a date tonight to the wedding?
"Brennan: You see that a ton of wings start going up. Actually, make a Charisma check, make a Nature check for me."
"Murph: Oh Nature check, I gotcha."
Brennan: Just make a Nature check.
Lou: So my house is just covered in pigeons right now?
Brennan: Covered in pigeons everywhere.
"Kingston: [shaking his head] Mm, mm, mm."
Emily: I'm looking for the hottest one.
"Murph: I almost had a 19, but instead I got 3. I have a 7."
"Brennan: It looks like a lot of the pigeons are already settled up. [Lou laughs] You see that they say,"
"Pigeons: Oh, well, I don't know. I had my date, I had my people set up. All the people that I'm going with are all there."
"Emily: I think I'm gonna do a sultry lean up against the wall and say,"
"Sofia: [brushes hair out of her eyes] If anyone needs a plus one, [clears throat] I'm available."
Brennan: Go ahead and make a Persuasion check.
Emily: Oh dear.
"Murph: Let's all just turn into bugs, so you guys are bugs per se."
Emily: I got a nat 1!
Kugrash: Goddammit guys. We gotta impress these pigeons.
Ricky: Maybe I should try it.
"Kugrash: Ricky, please!"
"Brennan: You see as you say that, you're gonna be all, you see the pigeons all come over and say,"
Pigeons: Do you have crumbs?
[birds cooing]
[feathers fluttering]
Sofia: I'm sorry?
Pigeons: She doesn't have crumbs! Who needs her?
"Misty: Darlings, I have so many crumbs!"
Siobhan: And I take one of the cinnamon rolls and I—
Emily: Oh!
Kingston: Okay. Stop throwing cinnamon rolls around my damn apartment!
"Ricky: All right, I'll do as you say."
Emily: I follow suit.
Ally: I'm helping you clean.
"Kingston: Everybody says, goddamn!"
Ally: I'm helping you clean.
Zac: I take off my shirt and I put some crumbs on my chest.
Kingston: Ricky!
Zac: And I'm trying—
Brennan: Make a Charisma check.
"Ally: I'm watching, I am shocked."
Brennan: Make a Charisma check with advantage if you'd be so kind. Go ahead and have an advantage.
"Zac: 17 and three. So 17 plus three, so I had a 20."
Sofia fans herself.
"Brennan: Oh, you see that there's one pigeon who says,"
"Pigeon: [cooing] Oh, this guy's covered in crumbs. You can be my date anytime, mister."
"Ricky: Awesome, I'd love to go to this wedding with you. Do you wanna eat some crumbs off me?"
Brennan: You see that she hops up and begins to peck crumbs off of your chest.
"Emily: I'm kinda jealous, I poke her."
"Ricky: Ow, ow, ow."
"Lou: I lean over to Pete and I'm like,"
Kingston: I've been magical for 30 years. This is the craziest shit I've ever seen in my entire fucking life.
"Pete: I've been studying men for a really long time, and I can't stare at Ricky enough."
"Murph: I have Guidance. I wanna touch Sofia and,"
Kugrash: Try to seduce one one more time.
"Emily: Okay, what does that mean?"
Murph: You get to add a d4 to an ability. One ability check.
Emily: I'll go for another one.
Sofia: Still here to be a plus one!
Murph: I added three to it.
Zac: Oh.
"Emily: Okay, that's gonna be a 10."
Brennan: Did you do anything with the crumbs or no?
"Sofia: Yeah. Oh, I don't wanna put them anywhere indecent."
Murph: I just throw crumbs all over her.
Emily: I think I'm gonna be really polite with the crumbs and make a crumb trail all the way up to my mouth.
"Brennan: You see one pigeon looks over and says,"
Pigeon: It's a trick!
Brennan: And then they start walking away.
"Sofia: Oh my god, what is wrong with me?"
Zac: Can I cast… Is it a waste to cast Suggestion on this?
"Brennan: You can totally cast Suggestion, go for it."
"Zac: Yeah, I'm gonna cast Suggestion on just another pigeon."
Lou: Oh!
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Let's see, ready?"
"Brennan: Oh, the pigeon completely fails. Goes,"
Pigeon: Huh? [feathers fluttering]
Ricky: I think my friend wants to go to the wedding if you need a date.
"Pigeon: You can come with me, you can be my plus one."
"Sofia: Oh my god, it worked! I'm so charismatic, yes!"
"Pigeon: Anything you want, Mr. Crumbs! I'm happy to help."
"Ricky: Ow, ow, ow."
"Ally: Can I lean over and tell Kingston,"
"Pete: Seriously, people have hit me up for this wedding, so if you just wanna look like muscle, we can both go in there as dealers."
Kingston: I would much prefer that to the idea that I'm walking in there with a pigeon that I am possibly romantically entangled with.
"Misty: Kingston, you can be my plus one."
"Kingston: All right, fantastic."
Kugrash: Why did no one else get that offer?
"Kingston: Honestly, Misty, thank you so much. I appreciate it."
Misty: You're so welcome.
"Pete: I would've loved to see you in street clothes, though."
Kingston: I wouldn't have liked it. This is much better.
"Misty: You've got a nice suit, right?"
"Kingston: I do, of course, I have a nice suit."
"Pete: Come on, I'm gonna dress up really great for this wedding. You're gonna love it."
Kingston: Okay.
Pete: I can lend you some cool clothes.
"Kingston: Real quick, can we do a quick? So everyone's got a way to get in? Everyone's got a pigeon date?"
Kugrash: Do I have a pigeon date?
"Brennan: Kugrash, I don't think you have a pigeon date."
"Pete: Kugrash, you're in my pocket."
Kugrash: God dammit.
"Emily: I ask my pigeon,"
"Sofia: Do I get a plus one? As your plus one, do I get a plus one?"
Pigeon: Oh boy!
"Murph: I'm gonna cast Guidance on myself and try one more time to seduce a rat. All right, 9, but if I can use Nature, 13."
Brennan: 13? You see that one of the pigeons says--
[wings fluttering]
Kugrash: We can just go as friends.
Perry the Pigeon: That's gonna make me look a little desperate. Don't you think? That I can't get a date to the wedding?
"Kugrash: All right, we can go as—"
Sofia: Why don't you just go in my handbag?
"Kugrash: No, pigeon, do you wanna be dates? Do you wanna go as--"
Perry the Pigeon: Do you wanna be real dates?
Kugrash: I'll go with you. I'll be a real date with you.
"Ally: Oh, okay."
Perry the Pigeon: We can be a real date?
Kugrash: We can be a real date.
"Perry the Pigeon: Oh gosh, I've thought about you a lot."
Sofia: Oh no.
"Kugrash: [unconvincingly] Yep, I've thought about you, too."
Sofia: Oh no!
Lou: Is this conversation just happening in a room with thousands of pigeons?
Brennan: They all just— [wings fluttering]
Emily: Oh like. [wings fluttering]
Kugrash: I'm super popular with pigeons.
"Ally: I could be wrong about this, but I feel like maybe I've dealt drugs to these people, but I didn't realize that they were pixies, like I saw them—"
Brennan: Yes.
"Ally: Okay, cool, cool."
"Brennan: Yes, you absolutely have dealt. You look back over your text history and you're like, huh, some of this doesn't make sense that I would've been okay with it. I have to leave the drugs in a circle of mushrooms, in a weird pa— Stuff like that."
Ally: In a birdhouse.
"Brennan: In a birdhouse. Yeah, exactly. Cool! You see the pigeon says,"
"Perry the Pigeon: Wow, I guess dreams really do come true, huh?"
"Kugrash: They sure, you know what? This is gonna be a—"
Pete: You guys should kiss.
Kugrash: Sure!
"Sofia: Yeah, I think so, too."
"Kugrash: Get over here, Perry."
Murph: I put my lips out.
Brennan: You see that the bird just inserts its closed beak into your pursed lips.
Kingston: Oh my God.
Murph: This is fine.
"Kingston: All right, none of that in my house. All y'all pigeons, a broom is coming."
Kingston swings a broom over his head like a helicopter blade.
[wings fluttering]
Kingston: Everybody out Everybody out!
Kugrash: Meet you guys at the wedding!
Kingston: Everybody out of the house!
Kugrash: We'll meet you guys outside the venue!
Kingston: Everybody get out my damn house!
Ally: Does the pigeon leave your chest or is it—
"Brennan: Yeah, the pigeon does leave your chest."
Ricky: I didn't catch your name.
Brennan: The pigeon flies away.
[cooing subsides]
"Kingston: Kugrash, don't ever do that bullshit in my house again."
"Kugrash: Listen, I just got us into the wedding, all right?"
"Kingston: Well, next time tell me—"
Kugrash: You should thank me.
"Kingston: We'll go on the roof next time! I have a roof, I have roof access. This does not—"
Pete: That's so cool.
"Kingston: [aside] Thank you, Pete. This does not need to happen in my living room."
"Kugrash: All right, all right."
"Brennan: Oh, it is a fucking disaster zone in here of just feathers and debris."
Ally: I'm already helping to clean up.
Kingston: This is fine!
Ally: I'm spraying counters and—
"Kingston: Pete, it's fine, I'll call somebody."
"Siobhan: I'm pretending to help, but I'm just like."
"Kingston: All right, everybody stop wasting they time."
Lou: Can I call a cleaner friend of mine?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Murph: I can't tell the way things are supposed to look. I'm just like,"
Kugrash: This is fine.
"Brennan: There's a woman who lives on the block who always comes 'cause you have such a crazy schedule and you've been working with her, she's fucking great."
Kingston: Great.
"Brennan: You get a little text back from her being like, ""Nothing's gonna jump out or scare me this time, is it?"""
"Kingston: No, just too many feathers."
"Brennan: You see that there's a little ellipsis and then a question mark and that it says, ""Better not to ask."" is the text you get."
"Kingston: Yeahhhhh, with a bunch of Hs."
"Brennan: Cool! That evening rolls around. You guys head off to Central Park. Do you guys do any preparation before you guys head there, or what do you guys do?"
Emily: I hit up Conway's for some discount padded bras and whatnot and I squeeze myself into something provocative.
"Brennan: Awesome, great."
"Murph: I guess I would like a little suit. I guess I'd buy a suit off a doll. I ask Sofia to buy a doll suit for me. Like a dummy, a ventriloquist dummy suit."
Ally: And you look really good.
"Kugrash: Fits well, it's like it's tailored to me."
Brennan: Wonderful.
Ally: I think I go and get supplies and stuff.
"Brennan: Cool, rad. Do you head to Seven to do that or just your own supplies?"
"Ally: I feel like Seven and I have spot that's a karaoke bar at night, but during the way, we go and do inventory, and that's where we keep everything stashed."
"Brennan: Rad, very cool."
Ally: So I go there.
"Brennan: Cool! You meet up with Seven very briefly. Seven's got long sideburns, he's a rail thin thick eyebrowed guy. He's one of those very high- strung New York acidic nerds, just very nerdy about stuff. He meets you up at this old karaoke bar."
53\/3N: [sighs] Hey there.
Pete: Hey!
"53\/3N: [very fast-talking] How's it going, pal?"
"Pete: Good man, how are you?"
53\/3N: What happened with the home situation? Girlfriend kick you out?
"Pete: [sighs] No, it's fucking stupid. She thought I was selling drugs."
53\/3N: So you've been made.
Pete: Hmm?
53\/3N: So what you're telling me is you've been made.
"Pete: No, no, no it's nothing like that. No one knows anything."
"53\/3N: [sighs] Okay, what we are doing here, is we are tapping into a market that has an incredible demand and not enough supply."
"Pete: Okay, so what I need is multiple eight balls for tonight."
"53\/3N: I can do that for you, but what I have to understand is do you have the vision for the organization in mind? Are you gonna be a company man? Do you have what it takes? [sighs] For example, have you upgraded to Bitcoin yet?"
"Pete: No, okay? I don't do cryptocurrency. I don't wanna go to one of those cafes with you."
53\/3N: I could have you set up in 20 minutes and your money is making money for you.
"Pete: The coins that you're investing in sound made up, okay? I'm not trying to waste my money!"
"53\/3N: Money is made up [taps his forehead] by the government, dude."
Pete: Okay!
"53\/3N: It's a fiat currency! I don't need to talk about this with you right now. Okay, how many eight balls you need?"
Pete: [sighs] Give me as many as we have.
53\/3N: All right.
"Brennan: You see he takes out fucking enormous amount of drugs, hands them to you. You see he says,"
"53\/3N: Look, honestly a prediction. I read trends, I am on my computer all day every day working this shit out. In the next five to 10 years, the United States of America will not have currency, fact."
"Pete: Hmm. You are usually right about shit, all right."
"Ally: Yeah, I hand him $800 in cash and I'm like,"
Pete: Can you invest this for me?
53\/3N: [sighs] Do you want me to take this and go buy Bitcoin for you?
Pete: Mm-hmm.
53\/3N: I want you to set it up yourself. I want an organization—
"Pete: I don't know, I looked it up. You have to get a fucking wallet or something. I don't want my name on anything, here."
"Brennan: You see he takes $800 and says,"
"53\/3N: All right, I'm gonna invest this. You're not gonna regret it, all right?"
Pete: All right.
"53\/3N: The future is happening now, which means that now already happened and if you're too asleep to realize it, you need to [snaps fingers] wake up."
Ally: I'm adding his name to a note in my phone of people who owe me money and people that I have stuff out to.
"Brennan: Awesome! You get the drugs, you head out. Anyone else preparing or doing anything?"
"Lou: I have a sad moment where I'm going through my closet and there's a tuxedo from my wedding, and I push past it slowly, and then just grab a white shirt and a black tie and just [pats his face] some little aftershave."
"Ally: Maybe, do I come back there at the end of this sad moment?"
"Lou: Oh yeah! Pete just catches me standing in my closet just like look,"
"Kingston: Oh, Pete!"
"Pete: You good to go, man?"
"Kingston: Yeah, let's do it. Are you good to go?"
"Pete: I'm great, man, yeah."
"Kingston: Okay, great."
"Pete: Hey, thanks for letting me stay here again."
"Kingston: Of course, man."
Pete: It's been great.
"Kingston: You need a toothbrush or something, you good?"
"Pete: No, I'm good, actually."
"Kingston: Okay, great."
"Emily: Oh, I also go to a Sephora and use free makeup. 'Cause I don't wanna go home."
Brennan: You guys arrive in Central Park.
[Map sound]
"Brennan: Snow's actually starting to melt a little bit more today. Even though New York stays colder in the winter, the snow often just melts. It's not below freezing. So you're in the lovely Ramble, a little bit less lovely now that all the leaves have fallen off the trees. But the thick trees intertwine away from the lake. You guys arrive with each other in your nice duds and you see that there is a clearing through the trees where it appears that pigeons are beginning to descend."
[wings fluttering]
"Kugrash: All right, let's go pick up our dates."
Pete: You three have fun fuckin' a pigeon tonight!
Sofia: I take Kug aside and I give him a corsage I picked up for him to give to his date.
Kugrash: I don't actually want to fuck this pigeon.
Sofia: It seemed like you had a really good connection.
"Kugrash: Perry and I are friends. He's a pigeon, I'm a rat."
"Sofia: I know, I'm just sayin'."
"Ricky: I text Esther, ""Just in case you hear about this, I am going to a wedding with a pigeon. Just thought I should let you know."""
Ally: I'm reading over his shoulder.
"Brennan: Immediate text back, ""Why would I need to know this?"""
Ricky: Nevermind.
Lou: I offer my arm to Misty. We head off.
"Siobhan: You're so much taller than me. I'm maybe up to your elbow. I'm holding your arm, but it's like this. [her arm is nearly straight up over her head]"
"Ally: I take out a selfie stick and just look like I'm a tourist, taking pictures in the park so that I can stay in one area for a long time."
Emily: I think that we're all just getting together for a group photo.
Ally: It's just you and me in all my photos.
"Zac: I'm in there, too."
"Emily and Zac pretend to take selfie-stick photos together, flashing peace signs and leaning back-to-back."
Brennan: You guys arrive at [laughs]. You see that two pigeons land on each of your shoulders.
"Ricky: Oh, okay."
"Brennan: Your dates land. And Kugrash, you as well, a little pigeon lands there."
[camera clicks]
"Lou: Pete just takes a selfie of all, aw that's cute."
"Brennan: You see the pigeon says,"
"Perry the Pigeon: Wow, you look beautiful."
"Kugrash: Thanks, you look great, too, Perry."
"Perry the Pigeon: Okay, oh good! [sighs] Big day."
"Kugrash: Big day, Ronald Pigeon's getting married. My life sucks so much ass."
[cast cackles]
"Brennan: You walk through the Ramble, off the Ramble. [gentle piano music, minor key] You arrive at an old, not a doorway, but it's just an area where two birch trees grow side by side and in a little arch, two of their branches intermingle and ivy has grown up in between them. You guys are walking in here. I assume that Kingston and Misty are going ahead. As Misty approaches, you see that the leaves of the vines begin to shimmer and twinkle and part, showing a separate part of the park beyond what you saw as you were approaching, and you see a beautiful wedding tent in a clearing and little lights everywhere that you see the lights are themselves, sprites and pixies and fairies."
Sofia: [gasp] So cool.
"Brennan: And a small Faerie Glen opens to you. You see that there is a big buffet table. There's a band playing. You see the band is a couple of working musicians. It's a bunch of satyrs and fauns. You see that there's some dryads over in a corner that are smoking, and you see that there is a giant ogre that just has a huge tray of hors d'oeuvres. Many of the sprites and pixies are on the tray hanging out [wings buzzing] as they're eating hors d'oeuvres. Huge tent, and you see that there is a smaller area which looks like a little hunting lodge. That has a bunch of pixies that appear to be in very nice suits, some of them pinstripe, and the lodge has an open door, but also some entrances that are pure pixie-sized, maybe like an old Central Park groundskeeper's cottage that has been renovated and is now held by the pixies. That seems to be where a lot of the family is, while more of the guests and pigeons are in the tent and out on the lawn. You see that there's some lawn darts, some bocce ball. People are just having a great time here. Looks like the ceremony hasn't started yet. But you guys enter. What do you guys do as you enter the wedding?"
"Siobhan: I say so loud,"
"Misty: Oh, what a beautiful wedding! Oh! Oh my, oh! I love a wedding!"
Murph: What?
Misty: Everybody pay attention to me!
Pete: Who are you talking to?
Misty: I love a wedding!
"Brennan: You see that the band quiets down for a second and one of the satyrs looks over and goes,"
"Priapus: [a little raspy, lower] Well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't—"
Misty: [hand over her heart] Oh!
"Brennan: You see he shrugs his head and says— You recognize this guy, his name is Priapus."
"Misty: Priapus, oh, my darling, I haven't seen you since, oh what was that show that we did together you were in the pit for?"
"Priapus: A Midnight Cabaret, downtown."
"Misty: Oh, Midnight Cabaret. I love doing Broadway, but there's something about the visceral nature of the cabaret that just, you can see the people, the people can see you, you can touch them and smell them and steal their food."
"Priapus: I'm not gonna lie, you look good."
"Misty: Oh darling, you look good."
"Priapus: No, I'm talking. I'm attracted to you. I'm sexually attracted to—"
"Misty: Darling, I'm sexually attracted to you, too."
[Priapus sighs]
Pete: That was really straightforward.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
Priapus: Any chance we can get you up on that bandstand later tonight after you've had a few drinks?
"Misty: After I've had a few drinks, you know me. I love to perform, I love my people, I love my audience."
Priapus: I would bed you on the grass right now.
"Misty: I'm a little busy right now and I do have some things to do, but, maybe later."
Priapus: I am possessed with the spirit of the wild and there are things that are happening to me.
"Kingston: Hi, I'm Kingston."
"Misty: This is Kingston, my friend Kingston."
"Kingston: Nice to meet you. I'm Kingston, I'm Misty's date this evening."
"Priapus: Oh, okay."
Misty: [behind her hand] We're just friends.
Priapus: Gotcha.
"Misty: But also, if you feel like having any kind of—"
Priapus: If you wanna jump in.
"Kingston: I'm sorry, what?"
Priapus: If you wanna jump in.
"Misty: Yeah, if you wanna jump in."
Priapus: You are a beautiful man.
"Kingston: Misty, I'mma take a walk. I'll be right back. You and your friend can—"
"Misty: No, that's fine. [to Priapus] I have been trying to fuck that man for 40 years."
"Brennan: [laughs] He says,"
"Priapus: Oh, he's hard to get, huh? [cheers] Well, we'll get the wine flowing and we'll see what happens."
"Misty: Us theater people, we just have a different code."
"Priapus: Oh, it's the theater! We're artists, it's New York!"
Misty: It's New York!
Priapus: I've fucked every member of my band.
Misty: Great.
Murph: Do these people have a lust spell cast on? Can I check him?
Brennan: You see he's a satyr.
Murph: Oh!
Brennan: He is a spirit of lust and revelry.
"Kugrash: Oh, okay. I know these guys are horny."
"Brennan: Wonderful, what do the rest of you guys do at this lovely wedding?"
Zac: I look around just for snacks to see if they have any little plates going around.
"Brennan: You see that there is another ogre that's kind of dressed, clearly, the ogres are the caterers. He's just kinda tossing birdseed out to a bunch of the pigeons. You see that the pixies are all looking at these pigeons, very nonplussed and unimpressed."
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: It's like they're not into it.
Zac: I try a handful of birdseeds.
Murph: I guess I'll talk to my date.
"Onscreen is Perry’s character card, which reads “Perry Pidgeon: madly in love with Kugrash.”"
"Kugrash: Hey Perry, how do the pixies feel about the pigeons?"
"Perry the Pigeon: Huh, well, it's love, I guess. I think they love us, right?"
Kugrash: They love you?
"Perry the Pigeon: Maybe, I don't know."
"Kugrash: Jesus Christ, Perry."
Perry the Pigeon: That was a hard question.
Ally: That was a hard question.
"Kugrash: No, no, it's okay. You're fine, I think my--"
"Perry the Pigeon: Oh, wow!"
Kugrash: Excuse me!
Ricky: Wait.
Kugrash: Let me go get you some birdseed?
Perry the Pigeon: Okay.
Kugrash: And you stay right here.
Perry the Pigeon: I am in love with you!
Murph: I walk away.
Kugrash: Absolutely fuck me.
Ally: Is there a door person or—
"Brennan: Yeah, there's an ogre over by the door you can talk to. He's kinda dressed up. You see the ogre goes,"
"Ogre: [very deep voice] Hey, how's it goin'?"
"Pete: Hey, good."
Ogre: You the plug?
"Pete: Yeah, yeah, so if anyone talks to you, find me, I'll be around."
Ally: And then I just go around talking to the bartenders and stuff.
"Brennan: Cool. You see he says,"
"Ogre: Hey if you wanna drop a ball over by the food tent, go for it."
"Brennan: And you see that he throws a bunch of cash in your hands. You look at it, this is ancient British pounds from the 1700s."
"Pete: Hey, no, I need—"
"Ogre: What? This is what they use in New York, right?"
"Pete: No, no, it's dollars, they're green."
Ogre: The hell is a dollar?
"Pete: I show him, for example, this."
"Ogre: Oh, shit. I just got here from Faerie, man."
"Pete: [sighs] You're killin' me. All right, I'll leave something back there. I’ll leave something for you."
"Ogre: Okay, I appreciate it."
"Pete: You can help yourself with that. But if anyone hits you up, you hear rumblings, tell 'em where I am."
"Ogre: All right, God save the king, man, you got it."
Pete stares after him with a nonplussed expression.
Zac: Can I talk to one of the ogres for a second?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ricky: Hey, I don't know that much about this kinda stuff, but is it normal for a pigeon to marry a pixie?"
"Brennan: You ask an ogre, you see he says,"
"Ogre: Hey man, I don't fucking know, I just work here, right? You want some beef wellington?"
Ricky: Yeah.
Ally: Trying to get those macros.
Zac: [eating noise] I don't have enough napkins. My hands are gross.
Siobhan: Peeling off the pastry 'cause it's too much carbs.
"Lou: Can I walk up to Kugrash and Misty and kinda gesture to the hunting lodge and be like,"
Kingston: Feels like whatever we need to get done is in there.
Kugrash: Do we think Ronald Pigeon might be in danger?
Kingston: I mean—
Kugrash: 'Cause these pixies do not seem happy.
"Misty: I mean, look. Nobody's happy at a wedding."
"Kugrash: What is your sad life, Misty?"
"Misty: No, I'm not saying that weddings can't be joyous, but joy and happiness are not the same thing. And there will always be people who are miserable. Weddings have their own kind of magic. That's why people who shouldn't fuck always fuck at a wedding. Suddenly, the fight that you've been meaning to have for the last five years, suddenly you're having it in the middle of the dance floor. It's a strange magical place and you just have to go with it."
Kugrash: I think the mob is up to something.
"Kingston: Yeah, I agree. But, I don't know, I feel like, do you have a relationship with Don Confetti?"
"Misty: I have a relationship with Don Confetti. He's, as I said, a sweet man. He will kill you, but he's a sweet man. So I can go and talk to him, absolutely."
Kingston: Could you make introductions for us or something?
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys walk up. Who all’s going to the lodge with Misty?"
"Emily: I'm not, because seeing this wedding is bringing back memories, so I grabbed a champagne flute and entered the first closet I could find."
"Ricky: Oh, hey. Hey guys, I just thought of something. You ever seen that movie The Godfather?"
Kingston: Yeah.
"Misty: Yes, that movie—"
Ricky: You know how they have to do the favor? The Don has to do favors for people on the day of his daughter's wedding?
Kingston: Yeah.
Ricky: Is that--
Kugrash: Is that a thing?
Ricky: I think so.
Kingston: In The Godfather it is.
"Kugrash: It's based on real stuff, right?"
"Kingston: Okay, but that's based on human people. These are all—"
"Ricky: I don't know, it's a really old movie."
Kingston: Matrimony of pixies!
Ricky: It's so long.
"Pete: Hey Ricky, do you have a Godfather poster up in your room?"
Ricky: Yeah.
"Pete: Cool, I thought so."
Misty: How about a Scarface poster? You got a Scarface poster up in you room?
"Ricky: Yeah, I got both of 'em."
"Pete: That's sick, man."
Kingston: A little about—
Ricky: Those are my two posters.
"Brennan: The door to the hunting lodge opens as you approach and Misty, you look inside. You see that it smells so good. There's so much food in here, there's pixies everywhere. There's also grigs and sprites and other little types of fairies. You see that on a countertop, sitting,"
[slow jazz music]
"Brennan: You know those little pizza tables, the little plastic pizza things? You see that sitting at one of those, smoking a cigar, is a very old pixie in a pinstripe suit, weathered face, fedora hat, rings on his fingers."
Onscreen is a character card that reads “Don Confetti: Minute mafia mastermind.”
"Brennan: The gravitas of this tiny little man, again, about that tall. [holds his fingers a few inches apart] Pulls the cigar from his mouth, looks over and goes,"
"Don Confetti: [very high, buzzy voice, thick Italian-ish mafia accent] Well, well, well, if it isn't Misty Moore."
"Misty: Donny, darling, you look fabulous."
"Don Confetti: So, I see you brought some acquaintances here. Didn't know I gave a plus five on your invitation."
Misty: I don't have a plus five. I have a plus one and these other people—
Kugrash: We're guests of the pigeons.
Ally: I'm kinda walking off on my own to drop off the ball where I was supposed to.
Emily: I'm watching from the closet where I'm drinking by myself.
Misty: This food smells amazing. Did you bring it all the way from Faerie?
"Brennan: You see he looks and says,"
"Don Confetti: What? No, this is from Fat Sal's."
"Misty: Oh, I love Fat Sal's."
"Don Confetti: It's great, I think much like yourself, Ms. Moore, I haven't been to Faerie in some time. It's a real hard time getting all the way back there, especially from places like here."
Misty: It's a hard time and maybe there's some people there that I don't wanna see.
"Don Confetti: Oh, is that so?"
"Misty: Oh, you know!"
Don Confetti: That's real funny to me. Let me ask you a question. I heard you're doing a new play. Who are you playing in the play?
"Misty: [suddenly a bit nervous] Oh, you know, it's just a queen."
"Don Confetti: Yeah, that's what I thought. Tell me, let me ask you a question here if I can. Does Titania know?"
"Misty: What a beautiful wedding, it's really. So is your daughter, I mean, she's probably getting. I'm so honored that you invited me."
"Don Confetti: [shrugs] My daughter, she fell in love with a bird."
"Misty: Love is love. I fell in love with a bird once back in 1783, but really it was a fleeting affair. I thought it was love, but really it was just sex."
Don Confetti: The only bird I ever loved is a bird I killed when a crow tried to eat my babies.
Misty: Mm.
"Ricky: Sorry, you loved?"
Don Confetti: I loved that he was dead.
Kugrash: Do you not like the bird that your daughter's marrying?
"Don Confetti: Who, Ronald Pigeon?"
Kugrash: Ronald Pigeon. He's a good pigeon.
"Don Confetti: He makes my daughter happy, what can I say? Listen, you people come here to my faerie glade, middle of Central Park. You come in here in the middle of my little pizza table."
"Zac: Is that the little center thing on a pizza, you're sitting at?"
Brennan nods.
"Don Confetti: What do you people want, huh?"
Misty: We're here to celebrate.
"Don Confetti: Well then, celebrate away. Be my guest. Mangia [eat in Italian], this food is for you, all you fine people. I shall be here until the ceremony begins. I hope you enjoy yourselves."
Kingston: We did have a question.
"Don Confetti: Kingston Brown from Uptown, huh? Your reputa—"
"Kingston: Hello, Don. What?"
Don Confetti: Your reputation precedes you.
"Kingston: Oh, as does yours."
"Don Confetti: I hope it does, because I am the mastermind behind all the tiny little crimes that happen in New York City."
Kingston: The tiny crimes are abundant.
"Misty: Oh, by the way, I did lose an earring a couple weeks ago. I don't know. I'm not accusing you guys of anything, but I don't know if you found it on your travels, did you?"
"Don Confetti: Who's to say? Certainly not me. Those things which become lost in New York, only some portion end up in the pixies’ coffers, although we do well for ourselves, I won't lie. Mostly, these days I'm an honest businessman."
"Misty: Yes, just like I'm an honest Broadway star."
"Don Confetti: [laughs mockingly] Yeah. Well, gotta feed the fire, right?"
Misty: Gotta feed the fire.
Kingston: Santa's sleigh.
"Kugrash: Yeah, what happened to Santa? Do you know?"
Kingston: I'm sure you were aware.
"Don Confetti: I heard about it. Seems like some pixies got the wrong idea, huh?"
Murph: Can I do an Insight check on him?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
Murph: And I toss.
Lou: I'll also make an Insight check.
Murph: 16.
Lou: Less than 16.
Siobhan: 24.
Lou: 12.
"Brennan: Misty, he knows."
Siobhan: He knows.
"Brennan: He knows. You see he says,"
"Don Confetti: Looks like two acquaintances of ours, two boys that have done a little bit of trouble in the past got a bright idea, went rouge, acted on their own. They're in police custody now, Pinky and Twinkle. But they were not made men, not friends of the family. Looks like they might be going away for a long time. I, for one, am acting in full cooperation with law enforcement, as I should."
"Misty: Now, I don't wanna worry you, but it seemed to me there was something more than just pixie dust."
Don Confetti: Oh?
Misty: Maybe a little hellfire as well.
Don Confetti: Am I being asked these questions on behalf of any state or legal entities?
Kugrash: I'm an actual rat man. I can't really speak to the police.
Ricky: I'm not speaking for the fire department.
Murph: He’s just this ultimate narc standing there.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
Don Confetti: If there's no official capacity then I think I have business to conduct. Please avail yourselves to the hors d'oeuvres. Have a good time at the wedding.
"Brennan: You see that some pixies go to usher you guys back out. You're hidden in the closet. Actually, give me a Stealth check."
"Emily: What I would like to do. Okay, I'll give you a Stealth check. I got a nat 1."
Brennan: The closet opens.
Ally: No.
Brennan: And you see your brother Mario looking right at you.
"Sofia: Mario, what the fuck are you doing here?"
"Mario: Sofie, what the fuck are you doing here?"
"Sofia: No, I asked you first, what are you doing here?"
Mario: What do you see right now?
"Sofia: [slowly] Uh, I see Central Park at its finest and a Toyota Camry. What about you?"
"Mario: Sofie, funny running into you. I'm just running some errands. I'll tell you about it when I get home, I gotta go."
"Brennan: You see he grabs a bag off a counter, looks over at Don Confetti who doesn't look at him, and heads out."
"Sofia: What, Mario!"
Emily: I'll chase him.
"Brennan: You run out after him. You see he says,"
"Mario: Sof, funny runnin' into you here in the park, I gotta head out. I'll talk to you later, all right?"
Sofia: What are you doing with Don Confetti?
Mario: You can see it.
"Sofia: Yeah, I was feeding you shit before."
"Brennan: You see he looks at you and says,"
"Mario: Look, let's talk about this later, all right? It's dangerous here. I'll talk to you at home, okay?"
Sofia: What's in the bag?
"Mario: [looks behind him] None of your fucking business, that's what's in the bag."
"Sofia: I think it's my business, you and I share blood."
"Brennan: He turns to run. As he turns to run, you feel the flask full of water from Bethesda Fountain get burning hot in your pocket."
[water sizzling]
"Emily: Oh, I don't wanna use that."
"Brennan: Actually, it's just burning your skin. It's just hurting you."
"Emily: [sighs] Okay, I'll just chase after him, then."
"Brennan: Cool, go for it. Make an Athletics check."
Emily: Okay. It's gonna be 25.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You grab him, boom, into the wedding he goes."
Emily: I wanna backpack him and then pull him back in.
"Brennan: You backpack him, you pull him back in, you see he turns around, looks at you, he says,"
Mario: The fuck are you doing?
Sofia: Show me what's in the bag!
"Mario: [whispering] I can't show you what's in the fuckin' bag. Look, I will tell you everything, just talk to me later. Don't fucking pull me down, these people will… They'll come after Ma."
"Sofia: Okay. Okay. I don't know if you're abusing Ma's name right now, but okay."
"Brennan: He gets up, says,"
"Mario: Come to the house later, we'll talk."
Brennan: He takes off.
"Sofia: Okay, we better."
"Brennan: He takes off. The flask is now, you can feel your skin is actually starting to burn."
[skin sizzling]
Emily: Okay. I find some piece of cloth to hold it with.
Brennan: You hold it with some cloth. You see that it's getting red hot.
"Emily: I guess I. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just drink it!"
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: As you lift it up, get it too close to your thing, your flask bursts open and the water goes everywhere. It looks like the water inside of the flask was boiling."
Sofia: What the fuck?
Brennan: These guys come out of the cottage.
Emily: Does it feel like it was from seeing Mario that my flask started boiling?
"Brennan: No, unrelated, it feels like something—"
"Ricky: Ooh, can I—"
Sofia: [gasp] Something's gone wrong with Em! Something's going wrong with the angel of the Bethesda Fountain.
Kingston: What?
"Sofia: I run and I find you guys. Guys, I have a flask from the angel of the Bethesda Fountain and it started boiling. I'm worried that something is wrong with the water."
"Siobhan: How far is the Bethesda Fountain from the Ramble? Pretty close, right?"
Brennan: Right next to it.
"Kugrash: Okay, yeah, let's run to get over there."
Sofia: I'll run and check it out.
"Brennan: You guys take off from there, rushing as fast as you can. You arrive at Bethesda Fountain to see people looking around a little bit confused, but it doesn't seem like anything weird is happening. The statue of the angel is gone from the fountain."
Emily: [gasps] I guess I'll just get into the fountain and start looking for it.
Brennan: Anyone can make an Investigate or a Nature check if they want.
"Emily: Yeah, I'll make some kind of check."
"Zac: I think I have a card for it, but do I have Detect Good and Evil?"
Emily: I only got a 7.
Brennan: [to Zac] Yes you do.
Lou: I got 24.
"Zac: Wait, no, I have protection."
Brennan: 24 on Investigate?
Lou: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: It's not hard. You see that there's clear scrapes in the stone, something dragged this thing outta here towards a section of road with a manhole cover in it."
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna smash my champagne flute and then be like,"
"Sofia: Actually, that was premature. Let's just go down the manhole."
Brennan: What did you get on your Nature check?
Ricky: Can I see it?
Murph: I only got a 7.
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: I got a 19 on my Investigate check.
"Brennan: 19, investigate. You don't detect any fae anything here. Ricky, you're casting Detect Good and Evil?"
Zac: I thought I had it. I don't see the card.
Brennan: You have Divine Sense.
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: You just cast Divine Sense. You do not detect any celestial or infernal. You detect the faintest little whiff of undead, but then it's gone a second later."
Lou: I'm at the manhole trying to—
"Emily: Yeah, I'm there, too, I'm helping you trying to—"
Brennan: You guys open the manhole cover up. [metal scraping] You guys clamber down real quick.
Murph: Scramble down there.
[ominous music]
"Kingston: Kugrash, where the fuck are we? Where are we?"
Emily: I don't know. Are there tracks 'cause it was dragged?
"Brennan: Yeah, you see scrapes on the wall. You can even see scrapes on the wall. Clearly the statue was somehow removed from the fountain and dragged down into the sewers."
Murph: Can I see--
Emily: Let's follow the scrapes.
Murph: If there's any bugs or cockroaches or anything down here?
Brennan: Make a nature check.
Murph: Or rats?
Brennan: Yeah.
[ominous music]
Murph: 6.
"Brennan: Not that you can see, no."
Emily: Can I do a Nature check just in case?
"Brennan: Yeah, do a Nature check."
[ominous music]
Emily: 18!
"Brennan: 18. You're looking around very closely for those creatures that would be here. You notice something, which is you stop, you actually hear in the distance [chittering] and now that you're not looking for it, you hear it, too. You hear a chittering noise. You hear the rats speaking in a way you've never heard rats speak before."
"Rats: [high voice, lisping] My brothers, my brothers, the hour at hand! The clarion trumpets call! Let fly the flags of war! The drums beat, the trumpets play, the king has returned! The king, the king!"
"Kugrash: Oh, is this the fucking Rat King? This guy is such a douchebag! Oh, this guy's not the real Rat King. This is fucked. This guy sucks."
Zac: Do I detect any more? How is the Divine Sense?
"Brennan: You detect no more, there's no infernal, celestial, or undead down here."
Ally: Can we see anything or is this just all hearing at this point?
"Brennan: Sorry, you do detect a trail of celestial magic. You see a trail of celestial magic left by the angel as clear as light in front of you."
"Kugrash: Oh fuck, there's a Rat King."
Ricky: Follow me!
Ally: I just take off running with you guys.
"Emily: Running, yeah."
Brennan: You guys take off running. You hear the chittering chattering all around you.
"Rats: At once, at once, the banners ring! The day of men is over!"
Kugrash: Don't follow the fucking Rat King! He's a dope!
Rats: A day of rats now comes.
"Kugrash: No, goddamn it."
"Rats: Brothers in arms, cheese for all!"
"Lou: To us, is Kugrash just screaming?"
Brennan: Screaming and rat chittering.
"Kingston: Kugrash, shut the fuck up."
"Kugrash: No, dude."
"Sofia: Oh, he does this, he does this."
"Brennan: You guys vault through the sewers, going through from place to place. You guys see this big old steel door you have to open."
[door creaking]
"Brennan: You're in this giant cistern beneath the Central Park reservoir. As you walk into the space, you hear a voice of many rats speaking as one."
Ally: I turn to Kugrash.
"Onscreen is the Rat King’s character card, which has the subtitle “It depends on who you ask”."
"Rat King: [many overlaid rat voices] Oh, you are too late, I'm afraid, for the Rat King of the sewers now has his day. And I have been gifted my bride! She shall be queen to me! A queen to a king, [laughs maniacally] a day of the rats one and all!"
"Kugrash: You can't marry a statue, you fucking freak! This Rat King sucks! He's not the real Rat King!"
"Rat King: Try and stop me, brigand. I shall marry this rat queen at once!"
"Kugrash: All right, we need to do this for the good of the rats. Right, gang?"
Brennan: Boom! [door bangs] The door shuts. I'm gonna need you all to roll initiatives.
[ominous music]
"Murph: This is our fight. Oh, nat 1."
Brennan: And that's where we're gonna stop for this episode of The Unsleeping City! Tune in next time for a game of kings and queens!
"Siobhan: Gross, so gross."

Brennan: We find them deep underground in sewers of New York City. Our heroes face [rat voice] the Rat King.
"Kugrash: This dude sucks, he's a dumb ass."
Kingston: This is disgusting. Why am I here?
Rat King: Cry me a river. Beep!
[water rushing]
Brennan: Water starts to course in out of the pipes into the room. Albino alligators.
Emily: Oh!
Ally: What? They're huge!
Kingston: Drop it! [Brennan growls] Drop! [Brennan whimpers]
Nod: Dreams are anything you make them.

[RECAP]
Kingston: Welcome to the Unsleeping City.
Alejandro: You are what is known in Arcane Circles as a Vox Phantasmus.
Pete: I'm a voice for the dreams?
Alejandro: In the history of New York there has never been a Vox Phantasmus and a Vox Populi at the same time.
Pete: And a what?
Kingston: I’m the Vox Populi.
Brennan: You guys actually end up crossing through Bethesda Fountain.
"Em: I'm the angel of the waters, you can call me Em."
Kugrash: Did you happen to see anything weird going on?
Em: Don Confetti's daughter is getting married.
Kingston: We're just gonna run up in the pixie mafia's wedding?
Brennan: You feel the flask full of water from Bethesda Fountain get burning hot in your pocket.
Sofia: Something's going wrong with the angel of the Bethesda Fountain.
Brennan: The statue of the angel is gone from the fountain. The statue was somehow removed from the fountain and dragged down into the sewers.
Murph: Can I see if there's any bugs?
"Brennan: You actually hear in the distance,"
"Rats: The king has returned, the king, the king."
Kugrash: Oh is this the fucking Rat King?
"Rat King: Oh, you are too late, I am afraid. I have been gifted my bride. Try and stop me brigand."
[END RECAP]
[mellow electronic music]
[rumbling]
"Brennan: Welcome back, one and all, to the Unsleeping City. My name is Brennan Lee Mulligan, these are our Intrepid Heroes. Say hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"All: Hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"Brennan: We find them deep underground in the sewers of New York City. Grimy, filthy, smelling of shit and piss our heroes face The Rat King. Here, looking on this ancient cistern underneath the reservoir of New York, the aqueduct coming down into the city in Central Park, this ancient cistern, The Rat King's swarming, massive. So many hundreds and hundreds of rats with their tails all tied together in a knot, wearing a golden crown. You have entered this cistern and you see the door, boom, slam shut behind you and locks as The Rat King goes and presses this little panel over here on the wall next to him."
"Rat King: Well, my friends, it seems that you have come to the court of The Rat King. And you, Kugrash, pretender to the thrown--"
"Kugrash: You're a dumbass. You got all your fucking tails tied together, untangle 'em."
"Rat King: We are royalty and we do not have our tails tied together. We have one tail to unite all rat folk as one people. You know nothing, usurper."
"Kugrash: This dude sucks, he's a dumbass."
"Sofia: Oh my God, I just thought of something. We have to keep Kug away from The Rat King or Kug, you have a tail, right?"
Rat King: Your tail shall become one with our tail.
Murph: I tied my tail—
Ally: No way.
"Kugrash: No, that's fucking disgusting, you're disgusting."
"Rat King: We do not suck, in fact, we rule! And soon we shall rule all."
Ricky: You seem like you suck.
"Misty: Yeah, no, I think we're all in agreement back here that you suck, dude."
Sofia: I'm getting suck vibes.
"Kingston: This is disgusting, why am I here?"
"Kugrash: Well, it's not, I mean, the sewers are nice. He's disgusting specifically."
"Kingston: Okay, you know what?"
"Rat King: You do not wish to be in the court of The Rat King? Well, cry me a river."
Brennan: Beep. [blowing air] And water starts to course in out of the pipes.
"Emily: I knew it, I knew it."
Brennan: Water starts to course in out of the pipes into the room.
[blowing air]
[laughing]
"Rat King: It's sink or swim in the court of The Rat King. Come, my minions, and join our glorious revolution, our new queen is here."
"Brennan: You guys don't see Em, the Angel of Bethesda anyway, as he says, our new queen is here."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: Misty, you are first to act."
"Siobhan: Ah, shit, how far away is he, far? He's far, right?"
Brennan: He's very far away.
"Siobhan: He's more than 120 feet away, yes, he is. Also it doesn't matter."
"Brennan: He is, that's 80. So from there it's another, he's, yeah, he's like maybe like 130 feet away."
"Siobhan: Now can you explain this little platform situation in the middle here? How, do we, we would have to do like an acrobatics check to jump to these platforms--"
"Brennan: So, any step that you see that is not, like, normal human-sized step basically, you can either just use movement to get past it, meaning it's like extra difficult terrain. So basically to go from one step to the next step on these giant stone platforms, is gonna take about 15 feet of your movement, right? One for the normal step and then 10 to get up the vertical."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: You can also use acrobatics or athletics to make that terrain a little bit less difficult for yourself.
"Siobhan: For now, I'm just gonna ready an action, but I am gonna look over at young Ricky Matsui and say,"
Misty: Ricky?
Ricky: Yeah?
"Misty: Don't take this the wrong way, but you can really rock a fireman's outfit."
Siobhan: And I give you Bardic Inspiration.
Ricky: Thanks.
"Brennan: Awesome, what is the action you're readying?"
"Siobhan: Do I have to say that? I am potentially readying Crown of Madness, but that only works if there are more fighters in play. And right now The Rat King is the only one there."
"Brennan: So you're gonna, so to express your ready action, if an enemy combatant comes within range of the spell, you are going to cast Crown of Madness on them?"
Sofia: Yes.
"Brennan: Dope, awesome. Kingston, that's you."
"Lou: I'd like to bless… I was about to call you Kristen. Pete, Ricky and Sofie Bikes."
[Emily gasps]
[enchanting music]
Lou: So I'll--
[object clatters]
"Pete: Sofie, I feel like you've been here before."
Siobhan: You're so drunk already.
Sofia: That champagne was a wild ride.
Ricky: Can you put that broken flute down?
"Kingston: Exactly, Sofie, you--"
Sofia: I'm picking my teeth with it.
"Lou: But I bless the three of them. And then, I guess I'll, the water is starting to rise. Can I do an insight check to see how much, or the rate, or can I do some kind of guesstimation as to how long?"
"Brennan: Give me an insight, give me a perception check."
"Lou: Perception, great. It's gonna be 11."
Brennan: It is a geyser of water coming in here.
Lou: Got it.
"Brennan: And it's like four power, this is like water mains that have been fully opened onto the space."
"Lou: Great, I'll take, I'll take like, I guess I'll go, one, two, three. That's what?"
Brennan: 15.
"Lou: 15, and then can I use 15 to get here?"
"Brennan: Yup, you can use 15 to get up right on there, absolutely."
"Ally: We can't walk on the water at this point, right, it's too deep?"
"Brennan: Well, it's pretty viscous and murky. But you do see that this is a drain right here, so you're guessing there's probably only three or four feet of water. So you could actually, if you wanted to, charge through the water, it would just be difficult terrain. It would halve your movement.: Awesome. That's gonna be Pete."
"Ally: I'd get kinda stranded out there if I try to do that water, 'cause I can't jump up."
Zac: You can't jump to that?
"Ally: I mean, I can jump up to that, but if I try to do the water route and I get caught, like, right here, these are too high."
"Brennan: Oh, I know what you're saying, right, if you go around, it'll be harder to jump up--"
"Ally: Yeah, if I'm trying to go around, yeah, I could get caught."
Zac: I feel like we just gotta get to high ground.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Ally: Yeah, okay, I'm gonna do… The same movement as Kingston. Just go up, pop up next to him and then I'm gonna cast, I'm gonna cast minor illusion as like just a, a stinky wet piece of cheese."
[Emily and Lou laughing]
Ally: Right here.
"Kugrash: Oh, fuck."
"Brennan: I'm gonna need you to roll a deception check for me, with advantage 'cause you're creating an illusion."
"Ally: Cool, and deception, I have plus 7."
"Brennan: Cool, roll with advantage?"
Ally: 6. 17.
"Brennan: 17 plus, plus--"
"Ally: Plus 7, so 24."
"Brennan: You guys see the most incredible wheel of-- [all laughing] The most incredible wheel of some crazy, like, French cheese that's only made in one village. Pete, you feel yourself reaching sort of in and you go into yourself for a second and it's like 1892 and it's Ellis Island in New York. And you see that there is a little French man getting off a boat who says,"
French man: I shall open a cheese shop here and make the greatest cheese there has ever been.
[blowing air]
"Brennan: And the cheese he is dreaming of, boom, appears at the end of your hand and appears right here, right on the pipe. The Rat King says,"
"Rat King: Rats, that cheese must be mine!"
"Brennan: You see that where the cheese appears, a bunch of rats that were set out to come and attack you appear and attempt to get that cheese."
Emily: Ooh!
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: Amazing. Ricky, that's gonna be you."
"Zac: Okay, this feels maybe dumb but I'm going to cast, I get to cast Divine Sense. I can use it a couple times a day, so I wanna cast it to see if I can tell where the, where the fountain person is."
"Brennan: Okay, quick rule check while I see the range of Divine Sense."
"Zac: It's 60 feet, within 60."
"Brennan: 60 feet? The celestial presence goes deeper into the chamber, but you do not think within 60 feet of you that the angel is here. So you don't think that she's under the water near you, for example."
"Zac: Okay. I will… I'm gonna go over here. So one, that's 15 feet, so that's 20 feet, 10. I can't hop over to here, right?"
"Brennan: You can absolutely jump over there, yeah."
Zac: All right I'm gonna do that.
Brennan: Cool. So that's your movement.
Zac: And I think Divine Sense is my action.
"Brennan: Let me see how long, does it say how long divine sense lasts?"
Zac: Till the end of your next turn.
"Brennan: To the end of your next turn, cool."
"Zac: So unless, if it's still working, yeah."
"Brennan: Rad, you jump up, that's going to be, you see that The Rat King looks at you and says,"
Rat King: will you not kneel to your king?
"Kugrash: Real rats kneel to no Rat King, you fucking piece of shit."
"Misty: Yeah, this is New York City, we don't have kings here."
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Rat King: Kings, you do have, and what's more, their thick and beefy boys that come from beneath, Guards, seize these interlopers!"
Brennan: The water moves.
"Kugrash: Oh, the beefy boys, this is bad."
Brennan: Albino alligators.
Ally: What?
Emily: That's awful.
Zac: Those aren't rats.
"Sofia: Why, you are such majestic creatures, why would would you bow to such a lame one?"
Ally: They're huge.
Brennan: Hold on one second.
Murph: Where's the cheese?
[suspenseful music]
Lou: Wow.
"Brennan: This guy is going to… One, two, three, four, five, six--"
Lou: You couldn't have known.
"Brennan: Seven, eight. He's gonna make it all the way to there. This guy is going to make an athletics check to jump up and try to get Ricky. Does not, so this fucking horrifying fungus-covered albino alligator comes, [roaring] snap, right near where your face is. The Rat King says,"
"Rat King: these alligators were left flushed down toilets, forgotten by the people in the realms above. They have joined my cause as those of the sewers rise to take their vengeance on the sunlit world above."
"Brennan: The attacks they're going to make now, one of them takes an attack against Sofie."
"Emily: He knows I have a higher AC now, right?"
Brennan: [chuckles] I don't think he knows that. Misses Sofie. One is going to take an attack against Kugrash and misses against Kugrash. That is now going to be Sofia's turn.
"Emily: Okay, I feel like we need to get to the panel. Am I right? I feel bad leaving you two with the alligators--"
Misty: Get outta here.
"Emily: Okay, then I am going to--"
"Kingston: Thank you, Misty."
Emily: I would like to use all of my movement to try to get towards the panel.
"Brennan: Dope. Are you, so you're gonna rush away from the threatened area of two of those alligators?"
Emily: That makes it sound like it's a--
"Brennan: It's not a bad idea, but you have abilities that allow you to disengage and do stuff like that--"
"Emily: I know, but I wanna save, I wanna use my bonus action to add to my speed so I can get to the panel sooner."
Brennan: Make whatever call you would like to make. Let me know what you're gonna do.
"Emily: Okay, so do I need to tell you? Well, I kinda wanted to see how far I got and then take my dash."
"Brennan: So you're not taking a disengage, correct?"
"Emily: Yeah, so two of them or just one of them would get?"
Brennan: Two of them are gonna get their attacks opportunity on you.
"Emily: I guess I will, yeah, okay. So I'll use, I'll use… I'll use Step of the Wind to take a disengage. And then I'll move my full amount."
"Brennan: Cool, so that's gonna be 40."
Emily: That's gonna be 80.
"Brennan: 80, right. Let me see, 'cause these cost a lot extra, so I think we'd--"
"Emily: But I'm also an acrobat, so I can--"
"Brennan: Oh, you can make an acrobatics check for the round if you want to ignore some of the, like, for each of these gaps, you could, so there's one, two, three gaps. You can give me three acrobatics checks to try to overcome that penalty."
Emily: Okay. First one is gonna be 26.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you make it."
Emily: Next one is gonna be 11.
"Brennan: Okay, so you're gonna have to use movement to get past that on, you don't clear with acrobatics."
Emily: Last one's gonna be 26 again.
"Brennan: Cool, so we're gonna go five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, and it’s gonna be thirty, thirty-five, fourty, forty-five, fifty, fifty-five, sixty, sixty-five seventy, seventy-five, eighty."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Cool. You guys see Sofia just woo, woo, woo, woo."
"Pete: Fuck, that's so cool."
"Emily: I think I'm doing like front hand springs, too."
"Brennan: To, like, flip up there. Yeah, incredible, you make it all the way to the top. Also, next round, just so you know, you're entering your next round at a full sprint. So whatever things you do next round, you're doing with a full running start."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: So can I, sorry, use my readied spell?"
"Brennan: You can absolutely use ready spell, yes."
Siobhan: And would like to cast Crown off Madness on this guy.
"Brennan: Awesome, Crown of Madness, bada boom."
"Siobhan: So they have to take a wisdom saving throw, or be charmed for the duration. So my spell save DC is 14."
Brennan: What does Misty do to this fucking giant crazy-looking alligator?
"Misty: Oh, I see we're wearing crowns today,"
"Siobhan: I say, to The Rat King, and then I waft my hand in a fun little circle around the alligator's head"
and a iron disgusting crown.
"Brennan: [Brennan blows air] On the alligator. The alligator looks up at you with alligator tears in its eyes and goes, me king, too?"
"Alligator: Me king, too."
"Misty: Sure, everybody's a goddamned king today."
"Alligator: Me king, too, thank you, lady."
Misty: Oh boy.
"Brennan: Great. Cool, so now it must use its action before moving on each of its turns. Make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose."
"Siobhan: I mentally choose, yes."
"Brennan: Incredible. You see The Rat King looks and says,"
"Rat King: no, no, fair alligator, she is a pretender to the throne, remember your true allegiance."
Brennan: That's going to now be Kugrash.
"Kugrash: All right, big pile of rat posers. You're not the only one with minions."
"Murph: And I use a bonus action to, I would like to call upon the spirit totem, spirit of the juicy cockroach."
Kugrash: Just the juiciest fucking cockroach you've ever seen. One that ate a bunch of shit in somebody's apartment.
Sofia: Couldn't it just be a normal cockroach?
"Kugrash: No, it's gotta be big and juicy, one of the big ones."
"Murph: And it gives us, everybody within, so I can choose a spot within 60 feet and then it does a 30-foot aura. So I'll do, like, right around, I'll do like in the middle here so it kinda gets our guys."
Emily: That's a blessing.
Brennan: Great.
"Murph: And it's gonna give everybody temporary HP, five plus my druid level. So, nine."
[health bar noise]
Murph: So nine temp HP.
Misty: Is that including me?
"Murph: That's including you, 'cause you're in there."
Siobhan: Dope.
"Murph: I think so. Yeah, would you be 30 feet if it was here?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
Murph: Okay. And then that's a bonus action and we also get advantage on strength checks and strength saving throws while we're in the little thing. And then I'm gonna cast mirror image of myself.
Emily: Woo.
"Murph: So that there are two of me and whenever people attack me, they have to roll to see if they hit me or the fake one."
Brennan: Cool.
"Kugrash: You're not the only pile of rats, fuck face,"
Murph: then I do my dance.
"Brennan: You guys see three dancing Kugrashes in a row. The alligators start looking around, very confused."
Rat King: Do not be confused by this druid's tricks. He is a mystic and a bringer of ill news.
Brennan: Incredible. The water continues to rush in.
[water rushing]
Emily: Does he press anything else on the panel?
Murph: I think it's just open.
Brennan: It's just open.
Emily: Okay.
[suspenseful music]
"Lou: Oh, shit."
"Ally: Oh, wow."
"Brennan: I'm gonna need you guys to take Misty, Kugrash, and those alligators off the board real quick, if you'd be so kind."
"Emily: Oh, they're so cute."
Siobhan: That's so cute. Look at these little alli-cuties.
"Brennan: You know what happens when you guys call your enemies cute, right?"
Siobhan: They're so cute.
[suspenseful music]
[water rushing]
"Brennan: Kugrash, you're almost fully in water. Misty, you're like up to your, I wanna say like, chest, yeah. These alligators are looking hungry. The Rat King turns to look at you. Give me a perception check, if you'd be so kind."
Emily: Seven.
"Brennan: Cool. The Rat King looks at you and says,"
"Rat King: ha, an assassin, eh? Sent to kill my monarchy in its infancy. Well, you are under arrest."
"Brennan: And all of these rats chatter. I'm gonna need you to make a wisdom saving throw, if you'd be so kind."
"Emily: Okay. I'm blessed, some say this is normal."
"Brennan: Oh you're blessed, that's right."
Emily: That's gonna be an 18.
"Sofia: Thanks to the blessing, thanks to the blessing of my king, King-ston."
"Kingston: Oh, okay."
"Brennan: You see a spell [blows air] hits you and you do feel that Kingston's blessing repels his spell. And he says, what,"
Rat King: what trickery is this? My magic is second to none.
"Brennan: That's going to be, Misty, that's you."
"Siobhan: So Crown of Madness takes my action, but can I still do a movement?"
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: Great, so then I would like to...so this guy has Crown of Madness."
Brennan: He will not an attack of opportunity.
"Siobhan: Can I go onto this platform up here? I'll risk what I can, I don't wanna be in the water."
"Brennan: Okay, so that's gonna be five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, you can make it that far And that one's gonna get an attack of opportunity on you."
Siobhan: Bring it on.
[Brennan sucks in air]
"Siobhan: Hang on a second. As I'm passing him I go,"
"Misty: an albino alligator, you must be so ugly?"
Siobhan: And take away a--
Misty: You must be so ugly.
"Siobhan: Fuck, one from the roll that you just did, goddamn it."
Emily: That should be your thing for everything. You must be so ugly.
"Ally: You must be so ugly. Like you can't even see them, you must be so ugly."
"Brennan: Okay, is Crown of Madness concentration? I believe so, yes?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, it is."
"Brennan: You take 10, 12 point of damage And as you get to this square right here, this guy whips around and restrains you. Grabs on to your leg [growls] and is holding you in place."
Siobhan: Okay. So I have to beat a six or a 10?
Brennan: You need to beat a 10.
"Siobhan: Okay, great, and I have advantage on that because I am war caster."
Emily: And you're blessed.
"Siobhan: I'm not blessed, but I did get a 16."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you hold onto your spell's concentration but you are restrained in place and you did take 12 points of damage. The nasty fungal sewer awfulness in there seeps into your leg. That's going to be--"
Misty: I don't regret insulting you.
Brennan: That is now going to be Kingston.
"Lou: All right, can I cast a command on the alligator holding Misty?"
Brennan: You absolutely can.
Lou: So it has to make a--
"Siobhan: If you do that, your blessed will go."
"Lou: No, it's a--"
"Siobhan: Oh, it's not a--"
Lou: It's not a concentration spell.
Brennan: It's a single round thing.
"Siobhan: It's suggesting, that's it."
"Lou: Can I cast, yeah, it has to make a wisdom saving throw against my spell, spell save, which is 15."
Brennan: Got a 14.
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: What does Kingston say?
"Kingston: Drop it, drop it!"
[Brennan growls]
Kingston: Drop!
[Brennan whimpers]
Kingston: Drop!
Brennan: It backs off.
"Sofia: They're so cute, we need to keep one."
Siobhan: That's so cute.
"Brennan: Into the water. You are not restrained anymore, incredible. That's very good."
Lou: Can I still move?
"Brennan: Yeah, you still got movement."
"Lou: Great, I'd like to try and scramble up to here."
"Brennan: Cool, so that's gonna be one, two, three, four, yeah, cool. I'm actually gonna need you to, because you're going through water for that, I'm gonna need an athletics check from you to see if you can make it up there."
"Lou: Great, fantastic, and that's not one of the ones we get with that big juicy cockroach floating around?"
Murph: That's just strength.
Lou: Athletics?
"Siobhan: Oh, athletics is strength."
"Brennan: Athletics, yeah."
Siobhan: Athletics is a strength.
"Lou: I think we're good, 15?"
"Brennan: 15, you hop up there, no problem. You're, you know, you're older than you were back in your hay day, but you know what, you still got it, man."
"Kingston: Hey, I'll tell you on the worst day of my life where my house was ruined by pigeons and now I'm running around in a dirty sewer. It's nice to know I still got it."
Brennan: That's going to be Pete.
"Ally: All right, I'm gonna try to run up… So is that an athletics, also?"
Brennan: You can use movement for it or you can try to do an athletics to counteract some of that.
"Ally: Oh, I think I'll try to do an athletics."
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
Ally: Three.
"Murph: And then do we get advantage, 'cause it is strength checks? I was wrong, right? 'Cause if it's athletics--"
"Brennan: Oh, of it's athletics, it's strength, yeah, so you would get advantage on that from the cockroach spirit."
Lou: You're also blessed.
"Brennan: You guys see the, yeah, Kugrash has summoned this insane glowing, like, brown, glowing with like brown light being like,"
"Cockroach: it's the cockroach, I'm doing it. You feel strong, feel strong."
Kugrash: He's so juicy.
Pete: Ew.
"Cockroach: Do it, do it, do it Come on jump, get up there."
Lou: You're also blessed.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: That's true. But you are blessed so you can, you do roll with advantage, that's right."
Ally: Roll and then I roll again with blessed?
Brennan: Yup.
"Ally: Two and three again, very cool."
"Brennan: So you're gonna have to use your movement, so that's gonna be five, ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty, and you have one more, you can be like, or no, yeah, that's twenty-five, thirty."
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Can I see The Rat King from where I'm at or I have that big thing in front of me?
"Brennan: You can actually go to this square and duck around. He'd have like partial cover, which would raise his AC a little bit, but you might be able to catch like a glimpse of him, if you wanted to."
"Ally: Okay, yeah. I wanna cast Scorching Ray on him."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it. Let me see here. Yeah, I think you've got a pretty much straight line to this bozo, let me see. Just about, yeah, so we got a bonus AC. Go ahead and make your three attacks with Scorching Ray."
Ally: All right.With blessed?
"Brennan: With blessed, yeah."
"Ally: Well, that's a 19 anyway, so that one hits."
"Brennan: Oh, hell yeah. Seven and four is 11."
"Murph: Plus your spell attack modifier, though."
"Ally: Oh, yeah, yeah, with another seven."
"Brennan: 18, that hits."
Emily: Ooh!
"Ally: 13, four, 17 plus seven."
"Brennan: Yeah, even with his raised armor class from having that cover."
Ally: Thank you.
Siobhan: Kingston's seven-year-old nephew showed him how to dab.
Ally: 6D6 at The Rat King?
Brennan: 6D6 at The Rat King.
Ally: Thank you.
Emily: Ooh.
"Ally: One more D6, thank you."
Lou: Kingston can do a really quickie floss.
"Ally: No, only two sixes. Okay, 12, 20, no, sorry, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19."
Brennan: 19 damage.
Murph: Of course.
"Brennan: You see that The Rat King says,"
"Rat King: here in my sewer court, oh. [blowing air]"
"Brennan: And once again, your arm splits open and you realize that you're channeling nightmares right now. All the people that have ever burned to death in their sleep in New York City are fucking--"
Pete: Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: Fire's, like, echoing, you could hear, like, the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, every nightmare history thing of like, run, [shouting]. You guys see that Pete's eyes go completely black and blood starts oozing out of his eyes as your arm splits open. The Rat King goes [screams] as like, about a quarter of the rats in him are incinerated."
"Rat King: More rats, we need more rats up here, stat!"
Brennan: And I'm going to need you to make a perception check.
Ally: Okay.
Murph: And a wild magic?
Brennan: And wild magic.
Ally: Perception is a seven plus--
Zac: Do you add your blessing?
"Ally: Seven, 14 and then this blessed, 17."
Brennan: You see as you incinerate a chunk of something solid juts out off part of The Rat King.
"Emily: Oh, yeah, my girl's tangled up in there."
Brennan: Now roll for wild magic surge.
Ally: And it's one or two now?
"Brennan: Now it's one, two, and three."
"Ally: One, two, and three?"
Brennan: Yeah.
[exclaims]
Ally: 3! Oh no.
Siobhan: Fuck.
Lou: I'm standing much too close to Pete for me to be--
Ricky: You don't even add blessed to that?
"Emily: Oh, yeah, does she have blessed?"
Brennan: Do not add blessed to that.
Lou: What'd you roll?
Ally: A three.
Lou: Why couldn't it just be one and two?
"Ally: Whenever the dice hits something and that makes it stop, it's never a good roll."
Brennan: What is Pete feeling in this moment?
Ally: So scared from seeing all of these fires. I'm starting to think maybe I'm channeling evil when I do this.
"Brennan: You go, you see the, [growling] that there, a dog you remember from your street up state that used to scare you 'cause he barked real loud, appears in front of you and says, [growls]"
"Dog: remember me, you never have to be afraid again. I can help you. You want me to fuck someone up? You're the bad dog now, woof, woof. Remember that time I stole your sister's Halloween candy? I can do that again every time."
"Pete: [heavy breathing] Okay, cool. Get that Rat King."
"Brennan: [growls] And he disappears into moats of light that The Rat King, even your other friends that can see dream shit, don't appear to be able to see this shit that you can see. It [blows air] turns into moats of sparks and begins to swirl around The Rat King. You don't know what that wild magic surge just did, but it fucking did something."
"Ally: I open up my med bracelet and take my anti-psychotics, my Adderall, my testosterone really quick. Remembering that I haven't taken my meds today."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, that's going to be Ricky."
"Zac: I'm going to cast… Fuck, I wish I used this earlier. I'm gonna use Sacred Weapon now, just because it will be helpful. And I'm going to use a bonus action to cast, what's it called?"
"Brennan: Can you cast two spells in the same, or Sacred Weapon is not a spell?"
"Zac: No, it's not my, it's just an action. But then use the Shield of Faith on, I think I'm gonna use it on Misty."
Siobhan: Great.
Ally: Great.
Siobhan: What does that give me?
Zac: You add two AC.
Siobhan: Great.
"Zac: And it's a concentration. And then I'm going to try to move. Can I, if I move through here will I be attacked by everybody, yeah?"
Brennan: You'll get one attack of opportunity from his dude right here.
"Zac: All right, I'll go to here and just try to, like, be in the center of..."
"Brennan: One, two, cool, you go here. That guy's gonna get an attack on you. Misses. Cool, that's going to be the alligators."
"Siobhan: So I'd like to turn to the guy who has Crown of Madness and say,"
"Misty: you see this guy just bit me, what are you gonna do about it?"
"Brennan: He says,"
Alligator: As king alligator I will bite him.
"Misty: Mm, yes, good idea."
Brennan: He rushes over here to bite this dude. Let's see how that goes.
"Ally: Kugrash, you're just, like, drowning."
Siobhan: Hop on his back.
Ally: You're just a wet rat bobbing.
Lou: Its fur is probably matted together.
Brennan: He misses. This guy swims over here for Kugrash. This guy's gonna come over here for Ricky.
Emily: Luckily this isn't--
Brennan: Coming against Kugrash.
"Zac: Do I get an attack of opportunity on the guy who ran by me to get Ricky? I mean, to get to Kugrash?"
"Brennan: Where was he, oh, yes, you would get an attack of opportunity."
"Zac: Cool.Plus blessed, right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: That was 11 plus two, I knocked it over to a 20. That was 20."
"Brennan: 20 hits, which means that you actually arrest his movement, he doesn't come for Kugrash."
Kugrash: Yeah!
Ally: Yes.
"Kugrash: Thanks, man."
"Zac: And I did, ooh, that's 15."
"Brennan: You see that one alligator looks at you and goes, [growling] and suddenly, wonk, it's whole head disappears under the water with glowing ax blade in the meat of its shoulder"
Ricky: Stop it.
"Kugrash: Hey, he's a good kid, a good fireman."
"Siobhan: I have a question about concentration. So I have concentration on this guy, but because I have war caster I have attack of opportunity spell casting?"
Brennan: Yes.
"Siobhan: Can I, 'cause that's not an action, right, it's just a reaction?"
"Brennan: It's a reaction, it doesn't mess with your concentration."
"Siobhan: So, can I then cast--"
Brennan: No one's triggered an attack of opportunity from you 'cause no one's left your threatened area.
"Siobhan: Oh they didn't leave the threatened area, they just came into the threatened area?"
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Siobhan: Okay, great, great."
"Brennan: So one's gonna go for Misty, missed. One is gonna go for Ricky. Miss, as well. Just [grunting]. But I believe Crown of Madness is every round, he gets another wisdom saving throw, right?"
"Siobhan: He does, he gets a wisdom saving throw every turn."
"Brennan: Cool. Fails again, these guys are not very wise, as it turns out."
"Siobhan: Yeah, who'd have thunk?"
Brennan: Who'd have thunk?
Ally: Who'd have thunk?
"Brennan: Great, that's going to be Sofia."
Sofia: Okay. I sip the last drop of champagne from my broken champagne flute.
"Ally: Oh, it's shattered."
Kingston: This is so wrong.
Misty: Your lips are bleeding. Are you okay?
"Emily: And then I want to, how far can I jump?"
"Brennan: With a running start, you go even farther if you do Step of the Wind."
"Emily: Well, yeah, so I wanna use my whole turn, like I wanna use every action I possibly can to try to get to that panel."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, what's your--"
Emily: Which I have Step of the Wind if I need to use it.
Brennan: What is your strength score?
"Emily: My strength is only one, but I usually use acrobatics."
Murph: Your total.
"Emily: Oh my total strength is 13, but I usually use acrobatics first off."
"Brennan: Gotcha. So this is gonna be, this is like such a long leap, but you're doing Step of the Wind. Bup-bup-bup, oh, Jesus Christ. Okay, also how tall are you?"
"Emily: How tall am I? I mean, what I wanna say right now, is like seven-foot- five, but probably I'm probably more like, five, 5'6, 5'10."
Lou: Good of you for being honest.
"Ally: 5'5, 5'6."
"Lou: Yeah, we don't really talk about it, she's 7'8."
"Brennan: Your long jump, you automatically, if you do Step of the Wind, is automatically 25 feet, which is insanely far but I'll, if you burn the ki point I will let you roll an athletics check--"
Emily: Athletics or acrobatics?
"Brennan: Fuck, we'll go acrobatics."
"Emily: Okay, yeah."
"Brennan: But I'll say that every five above 10 that you get is another five feet on the jump. So above 10, you're adding whatever you rolled to the feet jumped."
Emily: So what do I need to do to get it? So what do I need to--
"Brennan: So that's five, ten, fifteen, You'd only need to roll, you would need to roll a 25."
Emily: A 25 on my acrobatics?
Brennan: On acrobatics.
Ally: What do you have on acrobatics?
Zac: A six.
Emily: Plus nine.
"Murph: But even if you fail, you just fall in the water, right?"
"Emily: Yeah. Can I add, do I get to add this guy to it?"
Brennan: I'll let you add Blessed to it.
"Emily: Okay, cool, I'ma go for it."
Lou: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: So you're trying to beat, trying to beat a 25 on an acrobatics check right now, and you're burning the ki point for Step of the Wind."
"Lou: Last time you flipped a thing, now you're gonna jump."
"Siobhan: Oh, my God, it's gonna be so sick."
"Sofia: Sofie remember, it is what it is, whatever that means."
Brennan: Nine and two is 11.
"Emily: 11, so I got 22."
"Brennan: 22, so close."
"Siobhan: Oh, it's so close."
Ally: Dang it.
Brennan: Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw for me.
Emily: Okay. That's gonna be 20.
"Brennan: Cool, oh, do you have slow fall?"
"Emily: Slow fall, mm-hmm."
"Brennan: So you take, you go [bows air] leap, it is what it is. The Rat King goes,"
"Rat King: huh, no! [wind whooshes]"
"Brennan: And throws a gust of force from all the rats screaming at the same time, buffets you back, and you scrape, holding a hand and foot against the wall to land in the water down here, swimming."
"Ally: Wow, okay."
Emily: Am I gonna be able to get up that wall?
Brennan: That's gonna be a pretty fucking intense climb check.
"Emily: I should've just got, I, [groans]."
Ally: I think you're gonna be okay.
"Emily: I should've, but I should've gone over there."
"Brennan: So that's your movement, you used a bonus action and yeah, you actually, I think you actually still have an action left if you want it. Right, is movement bonus action for Step of the Wind?"
Murph: Mm-hmm.
Emily: Yeah. Can I climb?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can try to move, you can try to climb--"
"Emily: Or can I, if I have another action, can I just use it to move over and jump up here?"
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure, so it's difficult terrain 'cause you're swimming, so it's--"
"Emily: Well, I have acrobat so I get to potentially get less difficult."
"Brennan: Make a DC, if you make a DC 20 Acrobatics, we'll say it's not difficult terrain."
"Emily: Okay, DC 20 Acrobatics. I did yeah, 23."
"Brennan: Cool, so that's gonna be five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, yeah, you can get up to this ledge here."
"Emily: Okay, I'll take that, that'll be enough."
"Brennan: Dope, awesome."
"Sofia: Sorry guys, I'm trying to get that panel."
Kingston: That was still the craziest thing I've ever seen.
"Misty: It was very cool, very cool."
"Brennan: Very, very cool."
Pete: I think the water's gonna keep rising.
"Sofia: I know, that's why I wanted to get that panel."
"Brennan: Kugrash, that's you."
Emily: That's gonna stop it from rising.
"Kugrash: All right, I'm gonna climb up on this nice alligator and get, I guess, as far as I can over here."
Ricky: You can climb on me if you want.
"Brennan: Five, ten, fifteen."
"Murph: Yeah, can I climb up on my friend Ricky's back?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Kugrash: Is that okay, is it okay with you?"
"Ricky: Of course, get on my back."
Murph: I hop onto Ricky's back.
Brennan: Great.
"Kugrash: Wow, you got big lats, kid."
"Ricky: No days off, man."
"Murph: And then I wanna use a bonus action to move the sphere, 'cause it was back here, so it's not gonna affect some people in a little bit as people move. So I can move it up to sixty feet, so maybe I'll move it, where do you guys think I should move it if it's thirty feet? Maybe just like in the middle?"
Zac: Yeah.
Siobhan: Yeah.
Murph: I guess I'll do it like right around where Kingston is right now.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Lou: You telling me there's gonna be a big-ass juicy cockroach?
Murph: There's a big-ass juicy cockroach.
"Kugrash: Kingston, don't worry, I got you, buddy."
Kingston: I hate this.
"Kugrash: Juicy cockroach, come down."
Ally: Kugrash is ruining your life.
"Siobhan: Rats, cockroaches and pigeons all in one day."
Kingston: I hate this so much. I live a clean life.
"Murph: And then, so I'm there with Ricky. And then I still have an action, so I guess I'll create a flaming sphere."
"Brennan: Awesome, very cool."
"Murph: Sweet, so I'll create a Flaming Sphere. So, you know what, I'll just start it right on this guy. [points to an alligator to the left of him]"
"Brennan: Hell yeah, and he has to roll a save?"
"Murph: I think he doesn't take anything unless he gets hit by it or unless he ends his turn in it. It says any creature that ends its turn within five feet of the sphere must make a dexterity saving throw or takes 2d6 damage. As a bonus action, I can move it to ram people and then they have to do it. So I think it's like appearing above him, but doesn't hurt him yet."
Brennan: Gotcha.
Murph: It hurts him on his turn. Kugrash is playing the long game.
Brennan: Water continues to rise.
[water rushing]
[ominous music]
"Brennan: The rats go,"
"Rats: Sire, the cheese. It's phantasmal to touch, I can't get it."
Rat King: Get this cheese at once.
"Brennan: And that's going to be The Rat King, looks at you again."
"Sofia: Okay, bring it on."
"Brennan: And says,"
"Rat King: Freeze, you stand before royalty."
Brennan: And you Wisdom save.
Emily: [groans] That's gonna be a [clears throat] 11.
Brennan: I'm afraid—
Emily: A robust 11.
"Brennan: I'm afraid that Sofia is frozen in place as chills go up your spine, through your blood."
Ally: You're already in water.
"Brennan: Yeah, you're standing about knee-deep in water and feeling it rise around you."
[water trickling]
"Brennan: Misty, that's gonna be you."
Ricky: Get out here.
"Siobhan: I mean, yeah, I'm gonna get up as high as I can movement wise."
Brennan: Okay.
"Siobhan: And then, I still have Crown of Madness, so that's what that is, and then I'm gonna--"
"Brennan: Cool, those two are gonna get attacks of opportunity on you."
Siobhan: Fucking bring it on.
"Brennan: One, two, or one, two, three, four."
"Murph: This guy was attacking this guy, right?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, this guy."
"Brennan: Oh, he was, yeah."
Ally: Wasn't one of them being attacked?
"Brennan: Yeah, if you're here, he was there, if you're here, so you can go, basically, one, two, three, is fifteen, twenty, with an athletics check you can get up to the next thing."
"Siobhan: Great, and we have advantage on that because of the--"
Brennan: You do.
"Murph: Yup, the juicy cockroach."
"Kugrash: Just call to the cockroach, he'll help you."
Ally: The juicy cockroach oozes.
Kugrash: He's a good dude.
Siobhan: I got a 15.
"Brennan: Oh, 15, 15 gets you up."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: Cool, they're gonna get some attacks on you."
Zac: You got that plus two AC this time.
"Siobhan: Oh, yes, so my AC is 16 currently."
Brennan: Before you get up there--
"Siobhan: Ah, fuck."
Brennan: This one here restrains you.
Siobhan: Goddamn!
Brennan: Restrains you and is gonna go ahead and deal [long pause] twenty-four points of damage.
[suspenseful music]
Emily: Ooh.
Siobhan: Fuck.
Brennan: To Misty.
Siobhan: Did you crit?
"Brennan: And he critted, yeah. And you are once again restrained."
"Siobhan: Well, I'm real sick, guys. I'm on… I have five, five hit points."
"Sofia: I'm sorry, I can't heal you, I learned I'm not a healer."
"Misty: I definitely wasn't talking to you, but thank you."
"Brennan: That's your move, so then your movement, you are now restrained."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: But you can take actions. Oh, and you need a check for concentration."
"Siobhan: Well. That's, what's--"
Brennan: What's your Constitution?
"Siobhan: Constitution is 2, 14? Beats it, yeah, right? 'Cause I have to just beat a 10."
"Brennan: Yeah, you beat it."
"Sofia: As my bonus action I'm gonna look over to Sofia and be like,"
"Misty: [yelling] Sofia, that eyeshadow is a fabulous color."
"Sofia: [yelling back] Oh my God, thank you so much, it's from a drugstore, if you can believe it."
"Misty: No, I can't."
Sofia: Yeah.
Misty: It's great.
Sofia: I know.
Misty: We should go shopping.
"Sofia: Oh my God, yes, I mean, again I get it from drugstores. We could go shopping there."
"Brennan: Kingston, that's you."
Siobhan: So you have Bardic Inspiration.
"Lou: All right, can I climb up to the next level?"
"Brennan: You sure can. One, you can either use movement or do an athletics check."
Ally: We get advantage.
Murph: We have advantage.
"Lou: Yeah, I'll do an Athletics check then. My old ass running around, a nat 20."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Murph: And we see the juicy cockroach flies him up.
"Kingston: No, I want nothing to do with this juicy cockroach."
"Brennan: So I'm gonna say on a nat 20, we're not even gonna worry about vertical. You go one, two, three, four, five, six. You guys see, as Misty gets bitten, you look around, look up and see The Rat King commanding these alligators and you guys begin to, you guys see that Kingston's coat flares out behind him. The subway token he wears around his neck begins to glow, and you hear a bunch of voices in so many different languages going, “come on, come on, come on, Kingston, come on, you got this. Get up there, come on, come on, come on.” And you tear up the steps."
"Ally: I'm really proud watching him, I'm like, fuck yeah."
"Brennan: And that's, yeah, what do you do when you get up there?"
"Lou: Can I turn around, as cool as that was, can I turn around and cast a second level Command to try and Command these two albino alligators?"
"Brennan: Oh, you're gonna try to hit two of them at once?"
"Lou: Yeah, I'll use it, it casts as a second level spell."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you can go for it."
Lou: So both of them have to make Wisdom saving throws against 15.
"Brennan: I'll say that blue one is the one not holding Misty. Both of them, what is your Command, what's Kingston say?"
Lou: Do I have to give the same Command to both of them?
Brennan: Yes.
"Lou: Okay. If I… Okay, if I ask it, like, what are the chances that if I, I don't know if I'm allowed to ask this. If I ask them to flee, what are the chances they take Misty with them?"
"Brennan: You're not, you are not sure."
Lou: Okay.
"Brennan: There's a chance that if flee, if this one wanted to, it would just drag Misty away."
Emily: Disengage.
"Lou: All right, do that, I like that so I'm gonna, yeah, can I be like,"
"Kingston: Stop, just go, go."
Emily: Surrender.
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah, so you yell, stop, and you see that they, do you think Kingston more wants them to let go of Misty or wants them to move?"
Lou: More to let go of Misty.
"Brennan: You see that both, that one of them lets go of Misty and they both slink back into the water."
Emily: Ooh.
"Zac: Like further back out of that spot, or they're still in those?"
"Brennan: They're still in those spots, they have not left, but they have let go of Misty. And it looks like that they are fully stopping. So on their turn, the way the command works is on their turn they're going to do that action."
Lou: Great.
"Brennan: That's going, hell yeah, that's huge. Pete, that's gonna be you."
"Ally: Okay, I am going to try to run and jump. I'm going to try to use my action and like a dash action to get as close forward as I can."
"Brennan: Okay, go ahead and give me an athletics check."
"Ally: Cool. Advantage, right, for strength? Nat 20!"
Emily: Yeah.
Siobhan: Ooh.
Lou: Great.
Brennan: Holy shit.
Ally: Fuck yes.
"Pete: Thank you, cockroach!"
"Kugrash: Well, somebody likes the cockroach."
"Brennan: One, two, three, four, five, six. And you're just leaping as far as you can? That's a fucking nat 20. Go ahead and give me wild magic surge real quick."
"Ally: Oh, great. What is it up to, four?"
"Brennan: Now, just one, it resets."
Ally: Three.
"Brennan: Three, okay, cool. So yeah, I'm gonna say on a nat 20 that you insanely, you see that your boots split open and flame shoots out of them like rocket boots. [blowing air] You land and reach on to the edge of the panel right here. So you don't land all the way on it but you, huh, bam, and land there. The Rat King goes,"
"Rat King: Huh, dirty scoundrel."
"Ally: And I don't get any like, duck, movement or anything left? I probably used everything."
"Brennan: You used your full action, movement, everything on that insane athletics check to get over there."
Misty: Get a tetanus shot when we're done.
"Pete: Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Rad, that's going to be, bu-bu-bum, that's now, insane--"
"Ally: Yeah, that was wild."
"Brennan: You like, your jets are like going, you can't like get your legs together in unison, so you kind of like wave your hands in the air and rocket over and grab on to the edge. Ricky, that's gonna be you."
"Zac: Okay, I, so these, it seems like these two have stopped."
"Brennan: Mm-Hmm. That one's still controlled by Misty, yeah."
"Zac: You're on my back, right?"
Murph: Yeah.
Zac: I want to grab them and go as far forward as I can. Can I grab both of them and move?
"Brennan: That's gonna be an intense Athletics check to, I mean, Misty's very small. Misty's like 4'10."
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Give me, also, I'll call it a DC 20 athletics check to try and scoop them both up."
Zac: And I have advantage on Athletics checks right now. And I'm Blessed and I have Bardic Inspiration.
"Lou: Hell yeah, dude. Hell yes."
Brennan: [laughing] Jesus Christ.
Zac: All right.
Siobhan: Don't use the Bardic Inspiration unless you have to.
"Zac: Okay, I'm with that."
Ally: Good call.
Zac: That's already beat it. So—
Lou: Fuck yeah.
Zac: So that's like 21—
Ally: Yeah!
Murph: So strong.
"Brennan: You fireman, fucking New York's bravest, over one shoulder you got Kugrash. You pick Misty up and you can go. This guy's gonna get an attack of opportunity on you as you leave the space. Hits."
"Zac: Okay. Do I do, can I do anything?"
"Brennan: You're carrying them both, no sweat. But this guy hits you for 17 points of damage."
Lou: Shit.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: And you're also restrained, you cannot move."
Zac: Okay.
Murph: Oh fuck.
"Zac: Okay, and so I'm still carrying them?"
"Brennan: You're carrying them, you haven't used an action, but in your attempt to move away, this guy didn't get an attack on anyone else since the alligators last went, did he?"
Lou: No 'cause he got Sentinel.
"Brennan: He got Sentinel, right."
"Zac: All right, I will--"
Ally: Can you throw them?
"Brennan: Yeah you're, he's fully got you, not only are you restrained. So you get thrown off your balance, one of your legs is in his mouth."
Zac: Gotcha. Would it be crazy to throw them onto this?
Lou: Hell yes.
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Make another Athletics check for me.
Emily: Just tossing a pixie and a rat.
Brennan: I'm gonna say another DC 20.
"Zac: Okay. Okay, that's...So that's 10, 16, plus--"
Ally: Bardic.
Zac: Bardic Inspiration. 17.
Siobhan: Fuck.
Brennan: These two guys get over here.
Emily: All right.
Siobhan: Okay.
Emily: That's something.
"Zac: And that's my turn, right?"
"Brennan: That's your turn, yeah. That's going to be the alligators. This guy's gonna come for Ricky again. Now rolling with advantage 'cause he's already got you in his jaws."
Ally: What do you have?
"Zac: Oh, really, 49. I'm at 32."
"Ally: Okay, okay. It's more than I start with."
"Siobhan: Hang on, before you say anything out loud. I'm gonna look at the alligator that just attacked Ricky and say,"
"Misty: You're ugly, too, you're all ugly."
Siobhan: And I take away five points from whatever roll you just did.
[tense music]
Brennan: You just saved Ricky's life.
Zac: Oh!
"Brennan: You see that this thing has your leg and it goes to wrench you into the water, down deep. And Misty turns around. As you whip around, you guys see that a shade of poison moves around the edge of Misty's lips and tongue and a dart of spectral fae energy hits the alligator on the side of the head and it goes,"
"Alligator: [crying] No, me beautiful."
"Misty: You'll never make it in this city, you'll never make it."
[Alligator screams]
"Brennan: You see it looks over to the wall where there's a small poster of an alligator in a Broadway musical. He goes [crying]. Ricky, you are not hit for any extra damage."
Ally: It would have been over 30?
"Brennan: It would have, yeah, it would have been a—"
Emily: Dragged him under?
"Brennan: It would've dragged him under, yeah. Or it would have been so bad—"
Zac: Am I hit for anything?
Brennan: You're not hit for any damage. These two—
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: These two alligators each take a little step back, scared of Kingston. What does the Crown of Madness alligator do?"
"Siobhan: I mean, he's gonna continue to, it has to be a melee attack within somebody within range of him, so he's gonna continue to—"
"Zac: He can't move, okay."
"Siobhan: He can move, but like, I don't, that movement is not gonna be enough to get The Rat King."
Zac: Or what about the one eating me?
"Siobhan: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, can he attack the one that continues to eat Ricky?"
"Brennan: Yeah, he can swim over here and do that."
"Siobhan: Great, yeah, so I'll have him do that."
"Brennan: He actually rushes over, hits that dude, and grabs that guy and pulls him under the water."
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
Lou: We're really running these alligators.
Ally: Yeah.
Zac: Am I still grabbed by it?
"Brennan: It, well now, that's interesting, 'cause you're restrained by an alligator who is also restrained. So, yes, you are still in the jaws of that alligator, but that alligator is in the jaws of another alligator. You're like on your butt with your legs going into the water, like… The situation is bad."
Zac: Awful.
Ally: Terrifying.
Brennan: And the water's still rising.
Zac: Ah!
Brennan: That's gonna be Sofia.
"Emily: Okay, so I'm frozen. What does that mean?"
"Brennan: It means at the end of your, the water is rising around you. I'm gonna need you to make another Wisdom saving throw."
Emily: Another Wisdom saving throw.
Zac: You have Bardic Inspiration.
"Emily: Yeah, I know."
Lou: And you are blessed.
Emily: Okay. Oh my fucking God.
Brennan: What was it?
Lou: All 3.
"Siobhan: All 3, 3 across the board."
Lou: Everything was a three.
Zac: 12?
Emily: I got a 12.
Brennan: You got a 12?
Emily: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: That's exactly the DC.
Ally: Wow.
Emily: Thanks.
"Brennan: So you feel water rising. [blowing air] You look, see Ricky surrounded by gators as the water's rising up above his platform. It gets to here and you hear a voice in your head say,"
Voice 1: Hey. Whatcha gonna do? What are you going to do?
Brennan: The water gets here [to about his nose] and [shouts] you snap out of the spell.
Emily: I'm gonna fuck up that panel.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: And then do I get actions still?
"Brennan: No, that's the end of your turn. So it's your full action to get out of the spell."
"Emily: Gotcha, okay."
Brennan: So that's gonna be Kugrash.
"Murph: Cool, I actually realize, so is this guy, like, fully under the water or does he have Ricky and he's kinda like—"
Brennan: His back half is being dragged under by the other alligator.
"Murph: Got it, but his mouth is still up. He at the end of his turn, has to do a dex saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage from the Flaming Sphere."
"Brennan: Oh, 'cause he's restrained 'cause the Flaming Sphere is on him. So he's gotta make a dex saving throw."
Murph: And if he's restrained--
Brennan: He fails.
"Murph: Dope, so he takes six damage on that turn. And then, I, okay, so then—"
"Brennan: I'm gonna, sorry, roll a Wisdom save for the Crown of Madness one, real quick."
"Siobhan: Oh, yes, please."
Brennan: Fails again.
Siobhan: Great.
"Murph: Okay, then I'm going to—"
Misty: You look great in that crown. Keep wearing it.
The alligator wiggles its head in happiness.
"Ally: Thank you, thank you."
Murph: Then I'm gonna hop up here
"Brennan: So that's gonna be five, ten, fifteen, cool."
"Murph: Cool. Then, this is a little bit of a funky use of this cantrip, but Thorn Whip allows you to, if you hit, to pull something ten feet closer to you. I'm trying to use it to essentially get, like, around its mouth to open it up so Ricky can get his foot out, like, to pull him."
"Brennan: Oh, you want to use it to pull his, to move his jaw—"
"Murph: To, like, free him. Free him from his restraint."
"Brennan: And what's that, it's normally an attack roll. Is there any opposed element?"
Murph: It's a spell attack roll.
"Brennan: Spell attack, I'm gonna have to do a spell attack to hit and to do this alternate use. It's gonna be his Strength versus your Wisdom."
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: Cool. Go ahead and roll to hit first of all.
"Murph: Okay. So much. Duh-duh-duh, 25."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you definitely hit. You've gotta beat a 10."
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: With a Wisdom check.
"Murph: Come on, plus five."
Zac: Do you have Blessed or no?
"Lou: No, he's not Blessed."
Murph: I got a goddamn eight.
Brennan: But you still do the damage for—
"Murph: I do, I do, just 1d6, though. Three damage."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: This alligator is looking fucked up. You get a whip around its mouth and it's also being pulled by this other alligator, but it's not letting go of Ricky's leg."
Siobhan: So we've not killed a single goddamed thing in this fight yet.
"Lou: No. I'm look, I--"
Ally: Ah!
"Siobhan: Shit, goddamn it. Constantly under water."
[water rushing]
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: Jesus Christ. The Rat King goes,"
"Rat King: Very well, you wish to test the mettle of the rodent monarch, hyah!"
"Brennan: And a wave of rats descends on you. [squeaking] And as it goes to you, you see that [blows air] this weird sense of, like, a purring cat energy surrounds you. And the rats all [squeaks] squeak off, doesn't hit you. But you do see, as the rats part, you see the face of the Angel of Bethesda Fountain within the rats for a second."
"Ally: Em, Emma?"
Brennan: Em.
Emily: Em.
"Brennan: That's going to now be, so The Rat King attacks, misses. That's going to be Misty."
"Siobhan: Well, I'm gonna get up as high as I can. And I'm actually gonna break my Crown of Madness so that I can cast a second level Cure Wounds on myself."
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: Ricky.
"Brennan: One, two, three. So that's fifteen movement right there. You gonna make an athletics check?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'll do an athletics check."
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: Two 17s, yeah."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You, whoop, hop up here on this tall one. Next to your fae [blows air] lightness of foot, you are standing there next to Kingston on top of that tall platform."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: You've cured wounds, cool."
"Siobhan: Second, sorry, I'll just… Great, I'll make it."
[health bar noise]
"Brennan: So you break the Crown of Madness, that's now going to be, bup-bup- bup. Kingston, that's you."
"Lou: Ricky, what are you at?"
Zac: 32.
Ally: But he has two on him.
"Murph: It's, they're getting dragged."
"Zac: Yeah, they have to— I'll just drown."
Murph: We have to get him out.
Lou: Are you still restrained?
Zac: Yeah.
Lou: Can I see this one?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Lou: Okay, great. I'd like to Command, again, let's just keep the Command train going."
Emily: You're bossy today.
"Lou: Oh, yeah. I'm telling a lot of alligators what to do today."
Brennan: What do you say to this alligator?
"Kingston: Let it go, let go!"
"Brennan: Slinks back into the water. Ricky, you are, your head comes out of water."
Ricky: Ah.
Brennan: That's gonna be Pete.
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: Unless, Kingston, are you doing anything else?"
"Kingston: Get him, Pete."
"Ally: Okay, I am going to reach in past the squirming disgusting rats and grab Em. If I use shocking grasp to electrocute her metal, am I hurting her at all or am I just burning the rats that are formed on the outside of the metal?"
Brennan: I will allow you to make a… Just roll a Charisma check to see if you can use that spell in that way and feel free to add Blessed to it.
"Ally: Cool. 17, one, and then I have plus 5, yeah."
"Brennan: You start thinking, like, what are the limitations of my magic. I fucking, I'm what, I'm the Vox Phantasm? I've, what is this fucking and then you here a voice saying,"
Voice 2: Dreams are anything you make them.
[electricity crackling]
"Ally: Cool, yeah, I reach in and I just, like, electrocute Em trying to hurt this rat thing. Maybe I, like, hoist myself in first."
"Brennan: You can actually, if you wanna grab and try to use the statue to hoist yourself in—"
"Ally: Cool, yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Let's do this, roll me an Athletics check, we'll say that to beat a 10 means that you hoist yourself up. To beat a 15, means you're, like, yanking the, yanking the statue, able to yank the statue out, but you'll do damage, either way, through Shocking Grasp."
"Ally: Okay, cool. Come on. Ah, six."
"Brennan: Okay, but you roll blessed with that?"
"Ally: I mean, yeah. 2, 8."
"Brennan: Eight, cool, you grab onto the statue, you're still hanging off of it over the side. Go ahead and roll your damage for—"
"Ally: So d8, I think?"
"Brennan: Shocking grasp, yes."
"Ally: All right. 1, no! Fuck."
"Brennan: Wait a minute. I forgot, your wild magic surge—"
Murph: That dog?
"Ally: Yeah, my dog."
"Brennan: Your dog, roll that Athletics check one more time."
Ally: Okay. I'm gonna use the good dice. 15.
Brennan: 15.
"Ally: Oh, with a Blessed, yeah."
Brennan: With a Blessed.
"Ally: 1, 16."
Brennan: 16\. You see that you don't do that much damage with Shocking Grasp but the rats [blows air] let go just enough and you plunge into the water [blows air] with a beautiful angel.
Ally: Yes.
[water splashing]
"Brennan: You are under the angel statue, it is so heavy."
Ally: Fuck.
"Brennan: And fucking, woo. You go deep in the water with the angel."
"Ally: What, no, not yes."
"Emily: Oh, no."
"Brennan: You're under water, my good man, with the angel statue. But you see, The Rat King goes,"
"Rat King: My bride, my bride-to-be,"
"Brennan: and screams in horror. You have successfully wrested the angel out of The Rat King. That's going to be, oh, that's so cool. And you see that your dog begins to disappear."
"Dog: [growls] Got your back, kid. But one day I'll kill ya, one day I'll kill ya for sure."
Ally: What?
Dog: Bad dog.
"Siobhan: Do your wild magic surge first, Shocking Grasp."
"Brennan: Oh yeah, roll a wild magic surge for Shocking Grasp."
Ally: It's up to what? Now it's back to two?
Brennan: Back to two.
"Ally: 6, 9."
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: What a world.
Brennan: That's going to be--
Ally: What a world?
Brennan: What a world. That's going to be Ricky.
"Zac: Okay, I'm all free now?"
Brennan: All free.
"Zac: Ricky's kind of, this is maybe, Ricky's gonna go as far forward as possible."
"Brennan: And I believe you're still, no you got Commanded, now you're allowed to go, yeah, you're not restrained anymore, mm-hmm."
Zac: So to here.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: And then--
"Brennan: Give me, just for, because that's a lot of difficult terrain you're going through, just give me the Athletics to make sure that you can do it."
Murph: He can do advantage.
Ally: Yeah.
Zac: That was--
Brennan: You're rolling advantage.
Zac: What do I need?
Brennan: 15.
"Zac: Oh, that was a 7, yeah. Yes, I eventually got it."
"Brennan: Cool, dope. You hop up there."
"Zac: And then I'm gonna look at The Rat King and Command while pointing at the panel, and say,"
Ricky: Reverse.
Brennan: Awesome. This is for sure going to be a Box of Doom roll. Let's get that Box of Doom.
[Ally thumping table]
[Emily and Zac sigh loudly]
Brennan: The Rat King is gonna save against a Suggestion cast from--
Zac: Command.
"Brennan: Yeah, oh sorry, a Command from the questing blade of our paladin, Ricky Matsui. The DC's 13. The Rat King gets a plus two. On an 11 or higher, this The Rat King saves. On a 10 or lower, it fails."
[suspenseful music]
Brennan: Six!
Emily: Oh!
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: Gleaming light of civic responsibility echoes from your ax, what does Ricky say to The Rat King?"
Ricky: Reverse.
"Brennan: So he says, [gasps],"
"Rat King: My God, those rippling abs. Those ssssssssilky pectorals. We must reverse the water's flow!"
Brennan: And begins to turn towards the panel. That is going to be the alligators.
Lou: Kugrash!
Emily: Kug.
Brennan: No Crown of Madness. No--
Zac: He's been Commanded?
Lou: I Commanded him to let go.
"Brennan: To let go, which he did. These two guys are back in it."
[water sloshing]
Murph: I still got Mirror Image up.
Ally: Oh yeah.
Lou: Okay.
Murph: I am cursed—
"Brennan: So that just, is that just an even, what they got, that's 33%?"
"Murph: So I roll and if I get, if I have three guys, then if I get six or higher, then they attack that dude."
"Brennan: That dude, okay."
"Murph: Got a 14, so—"
Brennan: So one of them bites--
"Murph: One of them gets attacked. And they have an AC of 10 plus my Dex modifier so they have 14, if they get hit, then they're gone."
Brennan: First one of your Mirror Images vanishes.
"Murph: Cool, poof, Naruto style."
Emily: Yeah.
"Murph: Substitution jutsu. Then I roll again, eight or higher, they hit the second one."
"Brennan: Okay, eight or higher, the second one."
Murph: 17.
Siobhan: Nice.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Brennan: Want to see if gets—
Misty: Cursed no more.
"Brennan: And their AC is 14, right?"
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: Misses.
Murph: Yes.
Ally: Cool.
Brennan: Roll again.
Murph: Doing my dance twist. Two of us. 16.
Brennan: Let's see. Successfully hits it. He's gone.
Murph: He's gone.
Brennan: Last one's just making an attack against the real Kugrash.
Murph: Still doing the dance by myself.
Kugrash: I feel like I need to continue with this.
Siobhan: Everybody do the Kugrash.
Brennan: And misses you.
Murph: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: You guys look out and see this little fucking rat shaman on this little thing. All four alligators come out [growling] and fucking… [dances] Oh, yeah, you're doing some, like, real 80s moon dance kinda stuff, real Thriller, incredible."
"Kingston: He's nasty, but he's good."
"Murph: Yeah, I attach to a guy, do a wave, and he pops as he gets bent."
"Brennan: That's amazing, Sofia, it's gonna be you."
"Emily: Okay, so The Rat King's gonna reverse the panel, but he hasn't pressed it yet, or anything?"
"Brennan: Hasn't pressed it yet, no."
"Emily: But I don't wanna attack him, 'cause then that would, if I attack him, that's gonna stop him from pressing the panel, right?"
Brennan shrugs. Emily groans.
Murph: This guy takes 2d6. Fire Sphere.
"Brennan: That's right, yup."
Murph: Five.
"Brennan: Cool. That one's looking extremely fucked up. Yeah, what's Sofia gonna do?"
[suspenseful chime music]
"Emily: I don't know, I feel, I think that I don't want him to stop doing the panel thing, but I don't really have anything else to do."
"Zac: You can go for the panel, too."
"Emily: No but I, he'll know how do it better than I can. I guess I'll just swim down and try to drag Pete and the angel up. I don't really have good Strength, though. I don't really know what to do here."
Brennan: You gotta make the call. You could also get to that platform and ready an action.
"Emily: Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna try and hop up onto that thing and then leap across."
"Brennan: So you're gonna get up here, just move it--"
"Emily: I wanna leap across and ready an action for as soon as he presses reverse, then I attack him."
Brennan: Let me just get my little jump calculator out here.
"Lou: Jump calculator, by Texas Instruments."
"Siobhan: You know, you're not always gonna have a jump calculator in your pocket."
Brennan: Give me an Acrobatics check.
Siobhan: You gotta figure out how to do it on your own.
Lou: That's what they told me in high school.
"Emily: Okay, that's gonna be a 22."
"Brennan: Nice. Leap. And you'd have to spend your movement and your action, getting up out of the water, leaping across. 'Cause let me see. We have movement of 40 right?"
Emily: Yeah movement of 40.
"Brennan: So you're swimming. So you go, five, ten, fifteen, and--"
"Emily: I also have, if I have a DC 15, things aren't difficult terrain for me."
"Brennan: Oh, that's right, yes, yes, yes. So that's actually, one, two. Yeah, you fully make it across and you can ready your action."
"Emily: Okay, so I'm gonna attack him as soon as he presses the button."
"Brennan: Cool, and readying your action means you won't get your bonus action, just as an FYI."
"Emily: Okay, well, that's my fate."
Lou: Such is life.
"Sofia: Such is life, it is what it is, is what I've learned."
"Brennan: That's going to be, yeah, Pete, you go all the rest of the way down, and this angel has pinned you to the bottom underneath all the water. I'm gonna need you to, I know it's not your turn right now, but make a Constitution saving throw for me."
Ally: Okay. 5.
"Brennan: You can try to add Blessed to that, if you want. You gotta beat a 10."
Ally: Eight.
"Siobhan: Wait you have plus two, plus two."
"Ally: Oh cool, 10."
Emily: Oh!
"Brennan: 10, cool. So you do not begin to drown. It pins you, and you move your stomach at the last second. But you are, like, trapped under this giant angel statue in this, like, shit, piss, horrible sewer water. That's going to be Kugrash, that's you, baby."
"Murph: All right,"
Kugrash: Later gators.
"Murph: Misty Step, outta here. I'm gonna go thirty feet, as close as I can get to, where, I guess, I hear or saw Pete fall off. And then I would like to..."
Brennan: So that's thirty feet.
"Murph: Okay, and then I would like to, that's a bonus action, so I'd like to Wild Shape into a reef shark in the air."
Siobhan: Sick.
Emily: Yeah!
Siobhan: Oh my God.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: This is salt water?
Murph: And it’s a disgusting shark.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, of course."
"Murph: It's a sewer shark. And then I want to, they have speed of 40. So since I've already used an action, so it's just the one movement. So just 40 feet to try to get down to—"
"Brennan: Awesome, you get down all the way to Pete. You, like, get your jaws on the side of the--"
"Ally: I'm like, [screams]."
"Murph: And I'm winking, I'm trying to give a Kugrash wink. You know, I do my dance."
Ally: Oh no.
"Brennan: But you don't fucking know, you just saw a shark show up."
Zac: That famous shark wink.
Murph: Just a real dead shark eye.
Emily: A shark that winks at you--
"Brennan: You guys see the water rises till this is the least point here. The gators start swimming towards you. And The Rat King goes,"
Rat King: Quickly. [humming] [beeping]
"Brennan: And as the gators are about to pounce, the water level recedes. And drops them back down. Yeah, so the water went up and comes back down to this level."
"Emily: Okay, and Sofia Bikes comes in and fucking takes a hit at this dude."
Brennan: Go for it.
Zac: Plus what?
"Emily: Well, 20's gonna hit, right? I don’t even need my Bless."
"Brennan: 20 definitely hits, go ahead and roll damage."
Emily: I don’t even need my Bless. All right.
"Murph: These rats are wearing full plate and, like, plus-one shields."
Emily: It's gonna be 10. [mimes hitting with her elbow]
"Brennan: Jesus. You see, The Rat King says,"
"Rat King: Very well, to reverse for that wonderful man."
"Brennan: Wham, and you're just, shin, knee, foot, you get your whole left leg right in the meat of this Rat King, and you can—"
Sofia: I've practiced a little Muay Thai. I got thick shins.
"Brennan: And you can feel the tails split, its one tail start to split a little bit under you kicking it, and he goes,"
"Rat King: Ah, the royal tail!"
Brennan: And that's going to—
Sofia: I'm freeing all you little bitches.
"Ally: Fuck, don't become his new bride."
"Sofia: Oh, I don't know, I've been rejected by pigeons. If someone showed me a little bit of love, I might go for it."
Brennan: It's gonna be Misty.
"Siobhan: He's, The Rat King is less than 60 feet away from me, right?"
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: Great. So I would like to cast Phantasmal Force on him. He has to do an Intelligence saving throw. And then on a failed save, I create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Siobhan: So let me know if he succeeds.
Brennan: He does not succeed.
"Siobhan: Great, so I would like to conjure a real scary-looking rat catcher. And a creature that I create, they do 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it's in the phantom's area."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll 1d6.
Siobhan: Great. 6.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Murph: Nice.
Brennan: Fuck yeah.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see that you hit it and you see across from you, a shining beautiful man in a rat, in clearly a rat catcher's costume with perfect white teeth and a big pole, with, like, a rat-catching thing on the end of it."
Emily: Is that Ricky?
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Rat Catcher: [singing] Gotta catch, gotta catch."
"Brennan: And [grunts] slams, blood goes everywhere."
"Misty: [yelling] Darling, you're selling it, I believe every word."
Rat Catcher: I actually went and got coffee with a cousin of mine who's a real rat catcher and he told me all about the part.
"Misty: Yes, yes, do that work."
Ally: Do that work.
Misty: Acting is work. Acting is work.
Brennan: That's going to be Kingston.
"Lou: Great, I'm gonna cast Guiding Bolt on The Rat King."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, what does that do?"
"Lou: I make a ranged spell attack and if it hits, I cast, I make 4d6 radiant damage and the next attack roll made against the target has advantage."
Ally: Wow.
"Brennan: Oh, awesome."
"Lou: Great, let's see how this goes. Oh, 19."
Brennan: 19 hits.
Lou: Great.
Emily: Ooh.
"Lou: 6, 6, 1..."
Emily: It's gonna happen.
Lou: 1.
Ally: What a ride.
Brennan: An exactly average roll. How much damage is that?
"Lou: Oh so, wow, 14—"
"Murph: Fucking average, dude."
Lou: Average as hell. So 14 damage and then the next attack roll made against him has advantage.
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: Jesus, hell yeah."
Ally: He can't be looking good. We got him with Scorching Ray earlier. You got all that in.
Lou: Get ready.
"Brennan: Cool, Pete, that's you. So you're partially drowning, you're under this angel. You see that the shark doesn't appear to be attacking you, but you're just under water. What does Pete do?"
Murph: So much winking.
"Brennan: And you're also, you're like face-to-face with angel statue right now, by the way."
"Ally: God, fuck."
"Brennan: It's face is like, it's a beautiful, it's like, crazy, you're like trapped under this thing because it's, like, a beautiful statue. Although you see that she is now frozen in the pose of someone, like, weeping."
"Ally: Okay, I feel like this has just been, like, so shocking and scary. I'm gonna, in like a haze, even though I should, like, get out and save myself, cast Detect Thoughts on her."
[mysterious piano music]
"Brennan: You cast Detect Thoughts. In this insane moment of danger for yourself, you reach into this place of empathy and you're suddenly for a moment floating in the dream realm again. And you see a little smiling orphan child with gray skin and black eyes look up at you and smile. And as creepy as this fucking kid is, and it's a creepy kid, it just looks so serene and pleased. And you see it says,"
Voice 2: Everyone that ever came here had a dream.
"Brennan: And it looks, and you see the Bethesda Fountain being built. And the angel being placed there for the first time. And you see it says,"
"Voice 2: The Angel of the Waters, the fountain of purification and healing, where all things can be born anew, that's what dreams are. They're the one thing that connects us all. I'm glad that you wanted to know her dreams."
"Brennan: And you [gasps] breathe in some water and suddenly are blinded by two shining white lights. And just as soon as the water entered your lungs, it [blows air] exits, as a metal hand touches your shoulder and chest. And you see that the two blinding white lights are the eyes of the angel glowing white. And you see even under the water, you are detecting her thoughts and thus, can hear her. And she says,"
"Em: I'm the angel of the frigging water, kid, I would never let this shit hurt you. Let's get outta here."
Emily: Ooh! Yeah Em.
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: And begins to, so you, in the shark form, feel the angel start to move. Your desire to understand the thoughts of this being have awoken it from whatever was binding it."
"Ally: Fuck yeah, cool."
"Brennan: And you see that that's Pete, Ricky, that's you."
Zac: I'm going to just ready action to attack any alligators that come near.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. So you ready an action. Ricky, the alligators do."
[growling]
[water sloshing]
Brennan: Cool. You get a free attack on one 'cause you have an action readied.
Zac: And none of them came into my Sentinel?
"Brennan: None, no they're, like, jumping, so they're out of your reach by the time they get there."
"Zac: Yeah, that's like a 23."
"Brennan: Go ahead, the beefy boy that you've been doing the Flaming Sphere damage to, you hit him."
Zac: Great. I hit him for 10.
"Brennan: 10, yeah, he is looking so fucking hurt."
"Siobhan: Oh my God, we haven't even killed him yet?"
"Brennan: But he's gonna jump up and make an attack. He's gonna make it with disadvantage 'cause he's jumping up. That's a miss. Jumping up to hit Kingston, that's a miss. Two of them are jumping after Misty. Oops."
"Lou: Damn, they really like you."
Emily: I know.
"Misty: Look, what can I tell you, I'm a star."
"Sofia: She's a cute little pixie, she's like a snack to them."
"Brennan: Yeah, they all are leaping up, but you're a little bit too high out of the water and you're staying away from the edge as they chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp."
"Misty: Shoo, shoo, get outta here, shoo!"
"Brennan: You guys see that [blows air] Pete explodes [water gushing] out of the water. [blows air] This angel flies, drops you on the platform next to The Rat King. Circles around, lands on the platform here. And is going to… Heals Ricky Matsui for 17 hit points."
"Zac: Oh, wow, I'm, okay, I'm back at 49."
[Brennan blows air]
"Brennan: The angel looks around and says,"
"Em: Hi, it's real nice of you guys."
"Brennan: And she looks over and says,"
"Em: Hey there, Sofie. [waves]"
"Sofia: Hi Em, I'm glad to see you're doing well."
"Em: Well I'm covered in shit and toilet paper, but other than that, I'm feeling all right."
"Sofia: You still look good, you wear it well."
"Em: Oh, thank you!"
Brennan: That's going to be Kugrash.
"Emily: Wait, isn't it Sofie, don't I have a turn?"
"Brennan: Oh, sorry, yes, you do have a turn, yes, yes, yes."
"Emily: So I essentially want to take out my, I want to take out my little comb, my little hair styling comb, and start going at these tails, trying to get the tangles out."
Murph: So good at styling rats.
"Brennan: Go for it, roll me some attacks."
"Emily: Okay. Oh, but I'm blessed."
Zac: And doesn't it have disadvantage?
Emily: That was a 14 hit.
Lou: You have advantage on the first attack roll.
"Emily: Ooh, okay, good, I'm gonna need that. Okay, that was a 17 hit."
Brennan: 17 hits.
Emily: Okay. 10.
"Brennan: 10 damage, roll, any other attacks that you're doing?"
"Emily: Yeah, I'm gonna...So that is 18, gonna hit, right?"
Brennan: 18 hits.
"Emily: That's gonna be 8. And then, fuck it, burn another ki point, slap 'em again. That's gonna hit. So then for a 7."
Sofia frantically sprays and detangles the tails.
"Brennan: You see that as Em waves over you, you see Sofia reaches to the little pack on her belt, whips out a detangler, like a nail file. A spray. The Rat King he says,"
"Rat King: What, what are you doing? What devilry is this?"
"Sofia: If it's your wedding, you gotta look good."
"Rat King: What, no, no!"
"Brennan: And you see her just muscling in there, Sofie Bikes, [grunting] the tails, grime all over your arm."
"Rat King: Ha, our tail, our tail, our tail, our tail, our tail!"
[many rats chattering and repeating]
"Rat King: Our tails, our tails."
"Brennan: And the rats scatter, their tail untangled as the crown falls to the ground before you."
Ally: I barf. I'm right there and I throw up a bunch of water that I had swallowed.
Emily: Sewer water.
Brennan: Full barf.
Emily: Can I grab the crown just to hold on to it?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely, you can grab the crown."
Pete: I'm sorry I just barfed on it.
Sofia: It's honestly fine.
"Brennan: Kugrash, that's you, baby."
"Murph: Sweet. Okay, I'm a shark right now."
Emily: Maybe we should put the crown on the shark.
"Murph: I would like, wait, okay. So there's still four dudes there. Are they, can I poke my little shark head up out of the water and see if these guys still look aggressive now that the rat isn't?"
Brennan: They don't look as focused as they did before.
"Murph: Okay. Can I do… I guess I'll try to snap out of, I'm gonna snap out of Wild Shape and I'm gonna try to, I guess, like, reverse the spell. Try to use, like, Animal Handling or something."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Or actually, you know what? Let me, can I shark, try to jump up there and tell Sofie, put, or just tell, can you throw the crown to me?"
"Emily: Yeah, if you just swim under me, I can drop it onto you."
Murph: Cool.
"Brennan: Cool. You swim, give me a little Athletics check to pop up there. And I think you're also a swimming creature, so do it with advantage."
Murph: Okay.
Lou: Heavy athletics with the shark.
"Murph: He's only, he doesn't have that much. [snorts] 11."
"Brennan: Okay, you slump partially over the side. You're too big for the platform and Pete has to, like, jump out of the way. But you're like kind of hanging over the side. But Sofie does drop this giant crown on your head."
"Murph: Sweet, I turn back into Kugrash so that I'm now a rat king and then I say,"
"Kugrash: My children, you have a new fucking non-douche bag king now. Stop attacking your fellow friends of the shit."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll Animal Handling with advantage.
"Murph: Yeah, come on. 25 right away, 25."
"Brennan: So you see that, yeah, the shark flops over, turns into a rat, you have this giant crown on your head. [NY accent] The fucking king of New York, baby. [normal] You turn to them and say that, and you see all the alligators go [sad sound] And you see they all look so hungry, but they obey and begin to swim down. You see that one of them, three of them just submerge as the water gets sucked out. This giant sewer grate here, you see that one of them pops it up as it, you see them whirlpooling and you see that all the alligators are just very content but a little sad and are flushed down this drain together. And you see the last one goes, [whining]."
"Kugrash: I'm so sorry fucking sorry, this sucks."
Ally: We could've used that grate.
Emily: Is that rat still going after the phantom cheese?
"Brennan: You see that there are mostly a pile of drowned rats there, but you see that there is one rat, this little cheese there, that is crawling over the dead bodies of his companions. You see he says,"
"Rat: [gentle music] You must brave on, soldier, your king's orders. Cheese for the crown, long you have come, long you have tarried here."
Emily: Oh my God--
Rat: Let your hand be the hand.
"Brennan: And you see he reaches a hand up. Pete, you feel your spell, it is just a Minor Illusion of cheese. You could pump a little bit more juice into it to make it a little bit realer, if you wanted to."
Ally: I do that.
"Brennan: His hand touches a little piece of solid cheese, and he goes,"
"Rat: A life spent in service to a cause is the life I have chosen. My king, the cheese is yours."
Brennan: And collapses on the other rats.
"Siobhan: I'm watching, rapt, so that I can use this in my next performance."
Murph: I move the Flaming Sphere on over to them.
Kugrash: A viking funeral for my brothers.
Murph: It just smells like shit instantly.
"Kingston: Y'all gotta get me the fuck outta here. I am done with this sewer, we were at a nice party."
"Murph: Kugrash, Kugrash is weeping."
Kugrash: They were tricked.
Ricky: It's not safe to be down here in an enclosed space with burning rats.
Misty: You have any antibiotics on you?
Kingston: No.
Sofia: I wish I had that nip of Smirnoff now.
Murph: And then I'm gonna put the toasted rats down the drain so that the crocs can eat them.
Ally: Toasted rats?
"Brennan: Yeah, a bunch of toasted rats go down the drain. You hear some hungry alligators go,"
"Alligators: Mmm, thank you."
"Kugrash: Hey, least I could do."
"Brennan: The Rat King is defeated. And you see that the control panel, as Pete and Sofie jiggle the control panel, opens both the door that you guys came through and this upper door here."
Ally: Cool.
Lou: Wow.
Siobhan: Wild.
Brennan: Wild.
"Ricky: What were we doing, the wedding!"
"Emily: Oh, right."
Kingston: What about Perry?
"Sofia: Oh no, our plus ones."
Zac: Should we go back to the wedding just covered on shit?
Murph: We should talk to the statue.
"Brennan: You see Em looks around and says,"
"Em: [sighs] First of all, I'm so sorry. I didn't, you guys came here from a wedding? That is so thoughtful."
"Sofia: Yeah, well, I mean this was also supposed to be a wedding."
"Misty: I mean honestly, also like, we give it three years, you know what I'm saying, it's one of those weddings. Like you go as formality."
"Em: I know you wanna like leave a note and be like, if this ends within a year, can I get the gift back?"
"Misty: Right, I really could use that blender."
"Zac: What is the lifespan of a pigeon, right?"
"Em: Oh, yeah, that's true, let's not, oh—"
"Sofia: Oh, that's true, the pigeon might die."
"Pete: Oh, is it for money, was it for pigeon money?"
"Brennan: You see she says, she says,"
"Em: Look, I gotta get back to the fountain, all right. Something came and tore me off. The Rat King was there and he dragged me away but—"
Sofia: But it wasn't The Rat King—
Kugrash: Something else did it?
"Em: No, nothing else, to tear me off of that fountain you would need powerful magic."
Misty: Do you think it was infernal?
"Sofia: Did it feel infernal, yeah?"
"Em: Could be. Yeah, it coulda been infernal, but maybe something else. Listen, I gotta get back to my fountain. You guys know your way out of the sewers?"
Kugrash: Yeah.
Sofia: I'm sure Kug can.
Em: Come talk to me at the fountain any time. [kisses] You're all sweethearts.
"Misty: Oh, babes, since you're a angel of water, you can clean us up a little bit, could you?"
"Em: What am I, just some two-bit cherub? No I'm the Angel of the Waters of Healing, bless."
[blowing air]
"Brennan: And fire hose blasts you guys. You are clean as daisies, you even smell kinda nice. Sort of like the park in spring, a little bit of flowers on the air. You are fully drenched, it is water, it is not, not water."
"Ally: Can I roll to see how much of that $1,000 worth of blow was ruined?"
"Brennan: Oh, yeah, roll me a D20."
Ally: And then it wasn't ruined?
"Brennan: You want high, not low."
Ally: What's a—
"Brennan: You want a high roll here, not a low roll."
"Siobhan: I look at you and say,"
"Misty: This backpack situation, you really make it work, and I give you—"
"Pete: Oh, thank you."
Siobhan: Bardic Inspiration.
Brennan: Bardic Inspiration.
Ally: That six?
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Ally: 16, 20."
Brennan: 20!
"Ally: Not nat, but 20."
"Brennan: You look, the plastic cling wrap is still there."
[Ally sighs]
"Ally: Okay, cool."
"Em: Come talk to me at the fountain any time, dears. I owe you one. And don't think that I would be mad if you called in that favor, know that. [smooches] Kisses."
Kugrash: Appreciate you.
"Brennan: Spreads her wings and flies out of the sewers. The Rat King defeated, you hold his crown in your hands. And somewhere the wedding of Angela Confetti and Ronald Pigeon continues. Tune in next time for another exciting episode of the Unsleeping City."
"Siobhan: Angela, you're making a huge mistake."
Lou: Ronald Pigeon.

Kingston: Can we get out of this dirty-ass sewer?
"Don Confetti: Is it appropriate of your various cultures to say hi at a wedding, leave for the entire ceremony and then come back to enjoy the free food and drink?"
"Misty: Darling, the show must go on."
"Melissa: It's not too much longer, all you need is another year. You're gonna get it out of this."
"Sofia: This feeling of confidence that you have right now, enjoy it while it lasts."
Robert: What was it again?
Pete: Jeffery.
"Robert: Wouldn't wanna say your real name or bubbles would come out of my mouth, huh?"
"Brennan: You see Alejandro and Esther, they did not sleep last night."
Esther: You may have found something.
Titania: Silence.
"Brennan: Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. All of the glassware in your bedroom shatters."

[RECAP]
"Voice: [whispering] The angel of the waters, the fountain of purification and healing, where all things can be born anew. That's what dreams are, they're the one thing that connects us all."
Brennan: Your desire to understand the thoughts of this being have awoken it from whatever was binding it.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Emily: I want to take out my little hair styling comb and start going at these tails, trying to get the tangles out."
Rat King: [Everyone Yelling At Once] Our tails!
"Kugrash: My children, you have a new, fucking non-douche bag king now."
"Brennan: The rat king defeated, you hold his crown in your hands."
"Em: Something came and tore me off. The rat king was there and he dragged me away, but--"
Sofia: But it wasn't the rat king that threw you off?
Kugrash: Something else did.
"Em: No. To tear me off of that fountain, you would need powerful magic."
Ricky: What were we doing? The wedding!
[END RECAP]
[mystical piano music]
"Brennan: Welcome back to the Unsleeping City! My name is Brennan Lee Mulligan here are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Oh, gosh! Ah, last we left our brave adventurers off, they were deep in a cistern covered in grime and mold and muck, fighting against the rat king himself! Being victorious over the rat king, now holding the crown of the rat king, you guys liberated Em, the angel of the waters. The statue of Bethesda Fountain."
Emily: My girl.
"Brennan: Your girl. Who cleaned you guys off, healed you. Incredible bit of dream magic from Pete, waking Em up. Uh, and she flew off back to Bethesda Fountain. You guys are in your nice wedding duds. Drenched, but sweet- smelling, with a little bit of help from Em, purifying you guys of all the filth and shit and piss. What do you guys do, here in the sewers?"
Murph: Um...
"Siobhan: Wait, let's take a look at this crown. Is this crown...?"
Murph: Yeah.
"Ally: Oh, right!"
"Kugrash: I think I was wearing it. You guys wanna... hey, let's check it out. What is this?"
"Pete: You can keep wearing it, you seem like you really like it."
"Kugrash: Yeah, you guys can just look at my head. Look at my head, what is this thing?"
"Sofia: Kingston, weren't you talking about that guy who puts valuable things up his butt?"
"Kingston: Oh, yeah."
Kugrash: It it funny.
"Kingston: It's that guy who comes in here all the time. Yeah, this guy who comes in the hospital a lot who puts stuff up his butt, yeah."
Sofia: I'm saying we could--
Ricky: Do you think it came out of his butt?
Kugrash: I don't think you could fit a crown up there.
"Sofia: That's not my point! My point is, maybe he might have some perspective on."
Ally: Lowell.
"Kingston: Yeah, think about Lowell."
Murph: Can I do a wisdom check or something on it?
"Brennan: Uh, you wanna do an insight check on the crown?"
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: Be my guest.
Murph: Sweet.
Ally: Ooh!
Murph: 24.
Emily: Woo-hoo!
"Brennan: 24, very cool! Uh, Murph, do you have the card over you?"
Murph: I do.
Brennan: You get a bead on this and get the sense that yes. This is a magical crown. Whether or not it's been up a single individual's butthole is hard to say.
"Kugrash: Right, all right."
"Brennan: In all likelihood, given the state of wear and tear on the crown? This thing could've been up any number of buttholes."
"Emily: Um, I used to do colonics at the salon. Can I do an insight check to see if it's been up--"
"Kingston: I'm sorry, your salon offers colonics?"
"Kugrash: I was just trying to see if it was magic, but d'you wanna see if it's..."
"Brennan: It is, it is very magical, yes."
Kugrash: Got it.
Kingston: Can we get out of this dirty-ass sewer?
Misty: I concur.
Kingston: We can have this conversation up--
Kugrash: There might be some more cool stuff!
Murph: I just start crawling through.
[voices drowning each other out]
"Pete: All right guys, lets go. I can’t breathe."
"Sofia: Oh, my god."
"Brennan: All of you guys head tromping out of the sewers. You arrive back, having been dried off through the long period of coming down through the sewers. Maybe a little bit of magic here and there to help, 'cos you get out and it is freezing cold."
Ally: Fuck
"Brennan: The sun has since set. It is December in New York. Little strips of snow hang out here and there, but snow often doesn't hang around even if it stays cold in New York for very long. You arrive in the manhole cover that you exited from, back near the Ramble where you can presume that the reception for the wedding is just beginning. And you see Bethesda Fountain cracked in half."
[Emily gasping]
"Brennan: There is a blasted streak of soot and ash across it. And you see Em there on her knees, looking at the fountain, tears running down her face."
"Emily: Uh, I mean, I run to help her. I say,"
"Sofia: You know what, honestly, I have fixed worse hairdos than this."
"Brennan: See, she sort of laughs a little bit to herself and says,"
[somber piano music]
"Em: I don't understand. I've guarded this fountain since it was put here, The beginning of the park. I was the guardian of the waters. I was with the Rat King the whole time. It couldn't have been him."
Sofia: Why did you have to guard it to begin with? Who would you be protecting it from?
"Brennan: [sighs] She looks down and says,"
"Em: New York can be a tough city. There are a lot of odds stacked against the average person here. This fountain represented a change in the course of the city. Both in terms of, I was modeled to look like, you know."
Sofia: Million bucks.
Em: Thanks.
"Brennan: You see, she says,"
"Em: I was modeled after a washerwoman. Not a member of the aristocracy, this place was supposed to be a fountain to bring people joy. I was supposed to guard the human waters here. And you know, they hired a woman to design me. That's a big deal, I think--"
Sofia: You can tell. You've got a woman's touch.
"Em: I agree, I appreciate that."
Ricky: That's awesome.
Em: You a feminist?
"Ricky: Yeah, I think that's great. I am a feminist."
"Pete: I definitely have to interrupt this. Okay. What was, so you said healing waters. What was the significance? Because remember I had that vision where the baby told me that people come here with dreams. Everyone came here with a dream. Is this—"
"Misty: Oh, darling. People have been coming here with dreams for 400 years."
"Pete: Yeah, that's true."
Sofia: What year did the Bethesda Fountain get installed?
Brennan: [whispers] One second.
Emily: Just gonna put you on the spot real quick!
"Lou: Yeah, what are you made out of?"
Siobhan: What specifically is the type of stone?
"Emily: I can tell you the reason I'm asking, because maybe you don't even need to do—"
"Em: I actually do know, and it was 1864."
"Sofia: 1864, how old are you?"
Misty: A lady never... [grumbles]
Em: Sofia!
"Kugrash: Excuse you, yeah."
Sofia: We're all comfortable here! I'll say how old I am.
"Misty: I mean, look. Was I here in 1864? Sure, absolutely."
Sofia: Do you remember it getting installed?
"Misty: Ah, after so many lifetimes, one just forgets."
"Brennan: See, Em says,"
"Em: The point I'm trying to make is this. To answer your question, the waters that were put here were meant to be a source of divine magic in the city. And any time you have a city like New York that's very cosmopolitan, it tends to tap into a divinity that is neutral. For everybody. And there are ways to abuse that, if you're not careful. These waters are not only about healing. They're also about purification. People can come here and anoint themselves, start a new life. I can't tell you how many times someone's walked through this park and come by this fountain and decided to turn around for the better. But in a concentrated dose, it could also be used to purify… I don't know. Anything."
"Ricky: Like, something evil?"
Sofia: Like someone who was on the naughty list.
Em stares intensely at Sofia.
Pete: Someone who escaped.
Ally: Can I do an Insight check to look for clues around this fucked-up fountain?
"Brennan: Uh, yeah, go for it."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'd also like to do that."
Sofia: What was that face you made when I said naughty list?
"Siobhan: Uh, I got a 25."
Brennan: 25? Hell yeah. You scoop some of the soot off the thing. You've been around a long time. Smell it. This soot is not burnt stone or wood. This is old cremated flesh.
Ally: Jesus Christ.
Misty: [coughs] Kugrash.
Misty wipes her finger off on Kugrash.
"Kugrash: Hey! Oh, hey, what's that?"
"Misty: Uh, this is a person. This is the cremated remains of a--"
Sofia: Some kind of ritual ritual!
Kugrash: Somebody thrown in a felon?
"Ally: I take out a bunch of bags of coke and dump them out,"
Emily: Like respectfully?
Ally: And then collect some of these remains.
"Siobhan: Oh, in a baggie?"
"Ally: To get a sample. I flip it inside out, and then I put--"
"Sofia: Oh my god, the ultimate sacrifice!"
"Pete: I mean, remember, it almost all got ruined! In a way, this is all… I mean, do you guys wanna do some, or?"
Kingston: No!
"Kugrash: Wait, are you gonna snort some kind of dead demon person?"
"Pete: No, no, so we can test it!"
"Kingston: No, it's evidence!"
"Kugrash: Oh, I thought we were gonna snort it. I was gonna say I'll do it with you."
"Pete: You can have some blow if you want. Honestly, I don't touch the stuff any more."
"Kugrash: I kind of wanna know what happens if I snort the guy, sorry."
Misty: I don't think that's a great--
"Kugrash: I'm a rat, I'm sorry!"
Pete: That's not a rat thing.
"Kugrash: I'm the rat king, okay?"
Sofia: You got all up in arms when I asked women their ages.
Misty: These aren't recent remains. These are the ancient remains of a cremated body.
Pete: Maybe we can do some sort of testing.
"Misty: Oh, absolutely."
Sofia: I agree. I think this is a good move.
"Pete: I have, like, three bags of remains."
"Misty: Young man, I know that you're new to this. But don't you have some kind of Detect Magic, as a sorcerer, what...?"
"Pete: Uh, yeah, I do. I can ask to use that, I guess."
"Brennan: Absolutely. You do have Detect Magic, don't you?"
"Ally: I do have Detect Magic. I just don't know how I would. Oh no, I have Detect Thoughts."
"Siobhan: Oh, you don't have Detect Magic."
"Sofia: Maybe I have it. I know I'm not a healer, but maybe that's my magic."
Misty: Sofie…
Sofia: I put my hands on it.
"Misty: Sofie, your magic is that you're a wonderful person. And you jump really good."
Sofia: Do I get anything?
"Brennan: Uh, go ahead and roll me a pure luck check."
Emily: 14.
Ally: Damn!
"Brennan: Hey, you put your hands on there, and you hear a whispering."
Sofia: Oh my god.
Em: Sofie...
Sofia: Oh my god.
Em: You should stand up.
Brennan: And you see Em's talking in your ear.
Em: You gotta stand up. It's not gonna happen.
"Sofia: Okay, I'm sorry."
"Em: No, you're okay."
"Sofia: Absolutely, it's fine. Thank you, I'm not a detect magician."
"Ricky: Go, like, a hardware store nearby? Maybe we can get this thing patched up?"
Em: The whole fountain?
"Ricky: Yeah, I don't know. I can stay here if you guys..."
"Sofia: Look, my family works in construction?"
Misty: I think that we could maybe help in some other way.
"Brennan: See, Em looks out and says,"
"Em: Look, all of you are too kind to rescue me and then offer to help right here, I can't be here. I have to find a way to get back in touch with the waters."
"Misty: Can we take you to the reservoir or Washington Square Park, or somewhere else like that?"
Sofia: You could always stay at my place.
Misty: Do you live in a fountain?
"Sofia: No, I'm on Staten Island."
Em: I'm gonna go to Washington Square Park.
Misty: Great!
"Pete: No-one wants to go to your place, Sofie! I’m really sorry."
Sofia: The ferry is so quick!
"Em: Well, I can fly, so it's not that."
"Sofia: Okay, got it!"
"Em: I'm gonna go to Washington Square Park to figure something out. Be careful, be safe out there."
Misty: You too.
Em: Thank you for everything you've done. Something's going on.
"Misty: Hey, let us know if you need any more help."
"Em: Toots, [winks] I knew I could always count on you."
"Brennan: [exhaling heavily] She takes off into the sky. You hear the faint, sort of, twinkle of music coming from off in the ramble as the wedding continues."
"[light, sophisticated music]"
"Kingston: Well, let's go, I'm going to this wedding."
"Kugrash: Yah, lets go to the wedding"
"Misty: Yah, I’m going to a wedding"
Kugrash: This is the bread wedding. The pigeons are gonna get offed! I'm predicting it!
Sofia: [laughs] That's a really good pun.
Ricky: The bread wedding.
Kingston: The bread wedding
Kugrash: The bread wedding. 'Cos it's bad for birds to eat their bread. Thank you.
Pete: I thought it was rice. I thought birds could eat bread.
"Kugrash: I think, I think they don’t eat"
Kingston: Kugrash doesn’t really get to tell jokes that often.
"Pete: Oh, sorry."
"Kugrash: I'm a fuckin' rat, Pete."
Pete: I'm sorry!
"Misty: I like it, bread wedding."
"Pete: Hey, what should I do? I'll just keep it in my bag."
"Kingston: Yeah, hold onto the remains."
"Kugrash: I'm worried about my friend, Ronald Pigeon."
"Sofia: Um, is anyone vaguely concerned that we're gonna be going into a wedding we aren't technically invited to with a bag of remains?"
Kugrash: We're invited.
Misty: No!
"Pete: It looks like all the other drugs. Look,"
Ally: I hold up a bunch of dime bags.
Sofia: Your coke is really black.
"Pete: Mm-hm, yeah. It's crazy."
Sofia: Its really dark coke.
Kingston: Can we go?
"Kugrash: Yeah, we're plus-ones to the pigeons."
"Brennan: You guys wander back into the wedding. It's been like an hour and a half. The ceremony's fully over, so you guys just dipped on the ceremony and are now back here as the reception's starting up. Wine's going around."
[fancy band music]
"Brennan: You see, as you arrive back at the glade, people are now out of the tent, the dance floor's getting cleared out, you see as you enter back in, surrounded by other pixies, they're all hanging out on a mostly empty hors d'ouerves tray that an ogre is holding. You see that Don Confetti, no longer in the cottage, looks up at you and goes, Looks like you found your way back to the wedding."
"Don Confetti: Funny, is it appropriate in your various cultures to say hi at a wedding, leave for the entire ceremony, and then come back to enjoy the free food and drink?"
"Sofia: I mean, I'm fascinated that during your daughter's wedding, you were scanning the crowd to see who was in attendance."
"Misty: Darling, the show must go on. Sometimes things happen, and you have to improvise. And that's what's so exciting about life."
Brennan: Give me a persuasion check real quick.
"Sofia: I like her answer better, ignore mine."
"Siobhan: I got 20, not nat."
"Brennan: Not nat. You see, he goes,"
"Don Confetti: I suppose I don't have an understanding of how actors and various other hooligans and theater people conduct their business. But you're welcome to avail yourself to all the food and tasty treats here. Many of them are quite small, although, of course, that is to be expected, because I and my family are very teeny tiny."
"Misty: Teeny tiny in stature, but big in character and importance."
"Don Confetti: You have spoken truly, Misty Moore. A true friend, as always, to the pixies and the entire Confetti family. Please help yourselves to some cupcakes and also we have, I believe, some cannolis that are being passed around right now."
"Sofia: You do, I'm eating one."
"Don Confetti: It's good, right? We get 'em from Gianella's over in Brooklyn. They do a great cannoli."
"Sofia: Well, you should try it at Spaghetti's."
Don Confetti: What is happening in Staten Island?
Ricky: A bakery named Spaghetti's?
Kugrash: A bakery?
"Don Confetti: I'm sorry, I have to raise a point. Isn't your last name just the Italian word for bicycle?"
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah it is."
Don Confetti: A-woof. You know what I'm talking about?
Misty: Your last name's Confetti!
"Kingston: Watch out, Confetti!"
"Don Confetti: Oh, you got a problem with my last name?"
"Misty: [crosstalk] No, I love your last name!"
Brennan: You guys hear all a ton of ch-ch-ch-ch.
Zac: Little tiny guns?
Brennan: Little tiny guns. All these pixies cock—
"Kingston: Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Sofia: I take my earrings out.
"Kingston: Whoa, everybody."
Siobhan: I use Minor Illusion to throw confetti up into the air.
Misty: It's a celebration! Your name is a celebration!
"Don Confetti: Ah, the symbol of our name. Beautiful, confetti. Little pieces of paper to mark a celebration and they get stuck in the street and all the gutters and stuff. All right, help yourself to the food."
"Kingston: All right. That almost went real south, everybody."
Kugrash: Let's not get shot.
Kingston: Yeah.
Ricky: Do you bake spaghetti? I don't actually--
Sofia: It's a bakery called Spaghetti's.
Kugrash: Joey Spaghetti's.
Sofia: It's really good.
Kingston: It's honestly not bad.
"Sofia looks at Kingston, shocked, then points at him with a grin."
Brennan: I'm going to need everybody here to make a Wisdom saving throw.
[all groaning]
Murph: 22.
Lou: 18.
"Ally: 18, I get advantage on all Wisdom saving throws."
Emily: 17.
Zac: 4.
"Brennan: 4, gotcha."
Siobhan: 15.
"Brennan: 15, and what did Sofia get?"
Emily: 17.
"Brennan: Cool, gotcha."
"Ricky: Wow, right?"
Lou: Wise crew.
Ally: Here we go!
Siobhan: Too wise crew.
"Zac: Oh, can I use a lucky point?"
Brennan: You can use lucky point if you want.
"Zac: Okay, great. Nat 1."
"Brennan: Nat 1. We'll go with the eight! Do you get advantage on all Wisdom saving throws? Or, what does it say?"
Ally: Enchantment and possession.
"Brennan: This is not enchantment, so you do not get advantage."
"Ally: Oh, okay, 11. And then my wisdom."
Zac: Should I use another lucky point?
Ally: 13.
"Brennan: 13, gotcha."
Emily: It might be something small.
Brennan: Cool. You guys are hanging out at the wedding. The reception is starting.
[upmarket band music]
"Brennan: You guys see that the tent is full. Angela, the bride, is saying hi to everyone. She looks so happy. She's got, no shock here, a little pixie cut that comes over one of her eyes. She looks so happy. You see an announcer who looks to be this little cricket-legged faerie with a little tux jacket on, goes,"
"Announcer: [microphone squealing] All right, all right, all right! Let's clear that dance floor for our first dance between the bride and groom! Give it up for Angela Confetti and Ronald Pigeon!"
Ricky: I'm so excited to see what this looks like.
"Brennan: You guys see that Angela steps out on the floor, makes an earnest attempt to start dancing with Ronald, who's about as big as she is. But Ronald can mostly just pigeon around. [bobbing his head] He can't really dance. So he's just kind of jutting, higgledy-piggledy, over the dance floor. And she kind of twirls, and little bits of glitter around her as this happens."
Ally: I start trying to palm people different pill cocktails. 'Cos that's just how I bond at a wedding.
Pete: You're gonna need this.
Sofia: This is reminding me of my first dance with Dale so I'll take one.
Pete: There's a bunch of good stuff in there. There's about five different pills.
"Sofia: Cool, I take some pills."
Brennan: You pop some. Anyone who wants to can make a Perception check.
Lou: You know I will.
Ally: I don't think I'm very Perceptive.
"Siobhan: Oh, I got a nat 1."
Emily: 21!
Murph: 23.
Lou: 18.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Perception, I got 18."
"Brennan: 18, cool. So, Misty, what's Misty doing here at the reception with a nat one on a perception?"
"Siobhan: I mean, I'm just drinking champagne, baby. Dancing like this, like a real cool old lady."
"Brennan: Misty, you're having a ball, 'cos you're just holding court and making someone else's wedding kind of about yourself."
Ally: The only one who's invited.
Kugrash: Are you wearing white?
Misty: It's an off-white! It's a cream.
"Pete: It's pretty, it's glowing."
Misty: I would never be so rude!
Ricky: It's a beautiful dress.
Misty: It's traditional in my family to wear lace to other people's weddings.
"Brennan: Who got, some people got?"
Zac: 18 over here.
Emily: I got 21.
Murph: 23.
Ally: I didn't roll.
Brennan: Go ahead.
Ally: I don't think I'm very perceptive.
"Brennan: Not perceptive, that's totally fine. So, with an 18, what's Ricky up to at the reception?"
"Zac: Ricky kind of tracked down the snacks, and he was also, when they started dancing, just was very curious about that image, of—"
"Brennan: Honed in on that. For those who got above a 20, as you guys are just hanging out here, you all begin to notice a lot of different stuff. Kugrash and Kingston, you guys basically notice that there are a lot of different kinds of people here. In addition to fae, you see that Rourke Redcap is here. Who's one head of the faerie mafia. There's some domovoi that are like Russian fairies that are over in a corner. There's the band, who seems to be some water nixie spirit. The consigliere, Greg Prickthorn is here as well. You also are looking around. Are you guys looking for anything in particular, or are you just having a good time?"
Murph: I think Kugrash is a little concerned about his friend Ronald Pigeon and the other pigeons getting offed by these pixies.
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: So, I'm looking to see if anybody's like—"
"Lou: I'm thinking more about how all the different things are adding up. So I think there's just a head on a swivel, looking for more weird stuff."
"Brennan: Gotcha, cool. Kug, you see that Perry comes over to you and says."
Perry the Pigeon: Hi! Looks like the dancing's getting started right up in earnest!
"Kugrash: Yeah, very."
Perry the Pigeon: Care to shake a tail-feather?
"Kugrash: Yeah, we can dance, yeah."
Murph: I start doing my dance with Perry. I just have a little dance.
"Kugrash: Ah, Perry, how have the pixies been treating you?"
"Perry the Pigeon: Oh, they put out so many crumbs! They're such good friends."
Kugrash: Yeah?
"Perry the Pigeon: So good to see Ronald, you know. We were all worried for a little while 'cos they have that whole thing with Jessica Pigeon and that was sorta weird for a while."
Kugrash: What was up with Jessica Pigeon?
"Perry the Pigeon: Oh, y'know, one of those things where they met in college and they sort of fell into a pattern. And then they got off and sorta changed as people, But it was kinda like, good money after that. They'd already sunk so much time into the relationship that as they became more and more incompatible it just didn't seem to make sense any more. And all of our friends, you know. Nobody wants to be that first person to cross the river, to sort of mention, Hey, you guys fight more than you get along! So maybe you should think about packin' it in! You're still in your early 20s, you know. You could actually find another partner, go out and date around. But it just seemed to be that kinda thing where routine and habit, and every day it gets harder against the weight of all the previous experiences to break out of a bad pattern. It's when you're codependent—"
Ally: I stuff a Xanax in his mouth as I pass by.
Siobhan: So much Xanax in one pigeon!
Perry the Pigeon takes a xanny.
"Ally: It was a quarter, it was a quarter of a bar, don't worry."
Perry the Pigeon: [cooing sedately] Wow.
Pete: I'm sorry if I fucked that up.
Perry the Pigeon: Wow.
Kugrash: How does Jessica feel about this wedding?
Perry the Pigeon: So loose. So loose. Everything's good.
Kugrash: She's… You're just good?
Perry the Pigeon: I'm good.
"Pete: I'm so sorry, dude. I thought I was helping you! I'm sorry!"
Kugrash: That's the most I've ever gotten out of Perry!
"Pete: Oh, fuck!"
Kugrash: Perry was so perceptive!
Ally: I got some uppers too if you want to try to counterbalance this.
"Sofia: Oh my god, don't make a little cocktail in this tiny creature's body!"
"Kugrash: You know, why don't we give him a lot of coffee?"
"Pete: Oh, I got some coffee. I know just what you need."
"Perry the Pigeon: Hey man. Hey, man, you're beautiful."
"Kugrash: Hey, you're beautiful too. Perry, you're great."
Perry the Pigeon: You're beautiful. Can you fly?
"Kugrash: Uh, nope."
"Pete: Here's an upper, just give him that."
"Perry the Pigeon: I'm flying right now. On the ground, first time. Okay, I'm gonna take a walk. I can't be in here any more."
"Kugrash: Godspeed, Perry! Take your drugs back!"
Perry the Pigeon: I can't be around all these people!
"Kugrash: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, man."
Brennan: Perry leaves.
[fluttering wings]
Brennan: Sofia also got a high perception check. What's Sofia on the lookout for?
"Emily: Okay, well, Sofia is definitely not in her right mind because she was witnessing a happy marriage and it's giving her flashbacks and making her think of Dale. So I think, but possibly whatever she got from Pete is helping her to focus on intellectual things rather than emotional things. The fact that Mario was here is on her mind."
"Brennan: Gotcha, so she's on the bead for how and why Mario got here, and what the deal was."
"Emily: Yeah, I think she's scanning. But then something will catch her eye and she'll be like,"
"Sofia: Oh my god. [strained] It's the same table runner color as ours was. Sofia, get it together."
"Brennan: With a 21, you notice that the pixies partially recognize you. A couple of them make a look, not in a threatening or intimidating way, but in a way of, oh they must know your family."
Emily: He did know my last name.
"Brennan: Knew your last name, exactly. After the bride dance, you see they announce the father-daughter dance. You see Don Confetti dancing with Angela. You see him there, she goes like,"
"Angela Confetti: [very high, squeaky] Oh Daddy! It's so special on my special day!"
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Don Confetti: Angela, light of my life. Wind under my little butterfly wings. I love you so much. I don't know why you had to marry a pigeon. But know this. If he ever crosses you, he'll be sleeping with the fishes. And by fishes, I mean pigeons. They die all the time. They really do die all the time. They're not very smart or good at surviving."
"Brennan: She says,"
"Angela: I love you, Daddy!"
"Brennan: They just float around a little bit. After that, you see that Angela is actually over near you getting a little drink for herself. And catching a little moment. And as she flies past she turns over to you in her little white, it looks like white leaves that have been glued, a very form-fitting little pixie dress. She looks over—"
Sofia: David's Bridal?
Angela: How did you know?
"Sofia: Oh, I tried that one on. Honestly, I do not have the figure to pull it off like you, though. You look fantastic."
Angela: I'm not surprised you don't have the figure to pull it off. You're about a hundred times bigger than I am!
"Sofia: Well, yeah, you must've had to get that sized down. A lot."
"Angela: Yeah. It was really expensive. My dad paid for it, but it's okay, 'cos he's a very successful businessman."
"Sofia: Yeah, well, congratulations on your wedding day. Marriage is a beautiful thing."
"Angela: Oh, my god, that's so sweet of you to say! Thank you so much."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Angela: Love your hair, by the way."
"Sofia: Thank you, I do it myself. I know, it's crazy, a lot of aestheticians don't actually work on their self, but I do. Um, so yeah, I don't know, congratulations. Where are you guys gonna honeymoon?"
"Angela: Well, there's a lot of rooftops in the city that have a lot of crumbs on 'em, so that's where Ronald's interested in going."
"Sofia: What about you? I mean, your honeymoon shouldn't just be something that's so specifically for your husband."
"Angela: I think he'll end up going probably anywhere, but every time I've asked, he only mentions these rooftops with crumbs on 'em."
"Sofia: Oh, okay, well you should definitely look into, you know. Puerto Vallarta."
Angela: Really?
Sofia: Yeah.
Angela: I heard a lot of people were going to Tulum.
"Sofia: [about the cry] No, Puerto Vallarta's the most beautiful honeymoon you could ever go on."
"Angela: My god, sweetheart, are you okay?"
"Sofia: Yeah, I'm fine."
"Angela: All right, well, it's my day, so if you're gonna cry, go outside."
"Sofia: Yeah, absolutely."
Brennan: You see that she flies away. Yes.
"Ally: I have a quick question, was that a Wisdom-saving throw that we did?"
Brennan: It was.
"Ally: Okay, I do get advantage on Wisdom-saving throws. Across the board for my Plug bracelet. [holds up the card]"
"Brennan: Oh, hell yeah, great."
"Ally: So it isn't Dual Soul, but yeah. So I'm at like a 20 or something like that."
"Brennan: Cool, cool, cool."
Ally: I think I'm just trying to sell drugs again.
"Brennan: Pete, you actually, a guy comes over to you. One of the dryads who's been helping out, almost like a hostess here. Comes over and says,"
"Dryad: Uh, are you the plug?"
Pete: Yeah.
The dryad tilts their head towards something.
"Brennan: And points over to a table on the corner. This table appears to have humans at it. A bunch of humans. They're wearing very formal black suits. You see there's about three guys in black suits. They look very good-looking, pale. Sort of like sharp, predatory-looking people. There's one woman there who's got a pencil skirt and a black suit top. And you see that there's a much older man, who has that vibe that very old businessmen have sometimes of being made of granite. Just in how still and assured he is. There's another young woman there with them who's wearing a much more colorful gown and looks a lot more flush, younger. Maybe early 20s. Her mascara is running a little bit as though she's been crying. And you see that the dryad directs you over to their table."
Ally: Great. I put on my game face.
Pete: Beautiful night.
"Brennan: The old man speaks. You see the other younger people nod their head at you. The young woman doesn't make any eye contact with you at all. The older fella looks at you and says,"
"Businessman: [low, very raspy] Beautiful night is right. Well, we're out here, aren't we? Enjoying New York in the winter. Nights get long, and you can't see the stars but you can feel them out there."
"Pete: Yeah, totally, great party. I'm having a great time. You guys having a good time?"
Businessman: We could be having a better time.
"Pete: Agree, what can I get you?"
"Businessman: Well, I think we'll take, let's say, a brick of your finest snow, my young man."
"Pete: Great, all right."
Emily: Don't accidentally give them the cremated remains.
Ally: I'm digging through and trying to separate the full-on ashes.
"Pete: [under his breath] Okay, they're all in really dark bags. Okay,"
Ally: I pull out an insane amount of blow.
"Brennan: You see that the guy nods to one of the younger people at the table. And this young man hands you crisp, fresh from the bank notes."
"Ally: Cool, I don't count them. I just am like, oh yeah."
"Brennan: Puts them away. You see that the young woman looks up a little bit. The other woman, very slim and again, all business-looking. Takes the brick, cuts it open with one of her nails and begins to do out some lines, not in front of herself but in front of the young woman at the table. You see that the older man looks up and says,"
Businessman: Care to do some with us?
"Pete: I would love to, man."
"Ally: And as I do that, can I cast Subtle Spell with Detect Thoughts on this person by using a sorcery point?"
Brennan: Ooh. Hell yes.
Murph: That's awesome.
"Ally: Okay, so Subtle Spell I don't have to move anything and no-one can tell?"
"Brennan: You do not, you don't move your hands. Nobody can tell you're casting a spell."
"Siobhan: Oh my god, that's so sick."
Emily: That is awesome.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Rad. I gotta roll some saves.
Siobhan: Does that mean they don't have a chance to save against it? 'Cos they don't know it's happening?
Brennan: They do still save against it.
"Emily: And this is, are you casting on the girl that they're giving coke to?"
"Ally: The crying one, yeah."
Siobhan: That's a lot of dice.
Ally: Fuck.
"Brennan: Your sense of curiosity begins to move through. You completely glide over all of the people at the table dressed in black, including the old man, but the mind of the young woman opens up to you. You feel yourself split between reading her thoughts and the desire to go deeper. So you can either read just her surface thoughts or you could choose to go deeper. If you go deeper, it's gonna require active effort and might fuck up you talking to these guys at the table and give them a chance to notice."
"Ally: True, okay. Can I stay in surface thoughts right now while doing lines with them and then wait until—"
Brennan: Absolutely. You feel the young woman's surface thoughts are going:
[somber music]
Melissa: It's not too much longer. It's not too much longer. It's just another year. All you need is another year. You're gonna get out of this. You know other people that have done this and they're all fine. They got what they needed.
"Brennan: You see that the old man looks up at you and says,"
"Businessman: Well, after you, my good man."
"Ally: Great, I do an insanely long line."
"Brennan: He looks at you and says,"
"Businessman: Jesus Christ! You got a nose on you, kid! What are you, half elephant, my god."
"Pete: Nah, I just do, it's such a great night. What do you guys do? You're posted in the corner. Why aren't you out there mingling?"
"Businessman: Ah, you know, I'm an associate of Don Confetti. Old business partners. I wouldn't want to take up space on the dance floor. Besides, I got two left feet as it is."
"Pete: Yeah, definitely, you're telling me. You seem like a sports guy. You play anything?"
"Businessman: Do I play any sports? I used to play stick ball back in the day, but that was a long time ago."
"Pete: Very cool, very cool."
"Brennan: He looks over at you and says,"
"Businessman: How about yourself? What's your name, friend?"
"Pete: Ah, I'm Jeffrey. [holds out a hand to shake]"
Rob: [shakes] Jeffrey? Rob. Nice to meet you.
Pete: Great to meet you too.
"Brennan: He looks over at you and says, so."
"Rob: I imagine you're gonna be writing this wedding off on your taxes, huh? [laughs]"
"Pete: [laughs] Absolutely, yeah, yeah. You know what, I heard they're trying to pass some law that's gonna hike up the tax rate for people who are… You know, I believe in trickle-down theory, don't you?"
"Brennan: You look, by the way, and he says,"
Rob: Trickle down?
"Brennan: He goes,"
Rob: Trickle down? Reagan was a genius.
"Pete: Right, right?"
Rob: Reagan was a genius.
"Ally: I get him. I'm trying to get him so hyped up on this, and then."
"Rob: That man, I mean, what he did for this country."
Ally: I go for the deeper thoughts.
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: You go to her deeper thoughts. As you go to her deeper thoughts, you see that she starts doing lines off the table. The other three young men, the other young woman at the table, who are all very pale, watch her do lines by herself. All of them start to tap their fingers. As you go deeper into her thoughts, you see other instances of her going out with these guys, doing drugs, the people surrounding her. Fang distending from their mouth, sinking their fangs into her and drinking her blood. Not enough to kill her, but getting her high enough that they can get a high off of drinking her blood."
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: By the way, you do not see the old man drinking blood from her. You see, he looks at you and says,"
"Rob: Reagan, he was great. I mean, I never voted for him, 'cos I'm not a big voting guy. But I donated like crazy to his campaign."
"Brennan: Go ahead, first of all, give me a wild magic roll for that Detect Thoughts."
"Murph: Oh, no."
Ally: Two.
Brennan: Uh-oh! Now it's one and two. Now it's one and two.
Ally: Argh!
Brennan: Could you also be kind enough to give me a Deception check?
"Ally: Oh, cool, I think I have good deception. Yeah, I have plus 8. 19 with, what was Deception? I do plus these? Oh, yeah, that's 27."
"Brennan: Woo! Rad. So you see, yeah. He talks to you a while longer. After the girl's done a couple lines, you see that she looks around. Makes eye contact with you as her eyes well up with tears. Stands up and walks outside with the other four, and it's just you and the old man, Rob, who are here. You see he looks over at you and says,"
"Rob: Well, thanks again for being Johnny on the spot here. And what was it again?"
Pete: Jeffrey.
"Rob: Jeffrey, right. [winks, laughs] Wouldn't wanna say your real name or bubbles'd come out of my mouth, huh? [winks]"
"Ally: [moment of shock, looks around] Help. I laugh, I do not let him know that that registered with me. I’m like,"
Pete: Sure buddy.
Ally: And then I walk away.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Nauseous.
Brennan: Rad. What does Pete do as he walks away?
Ally: I'm trying to find Kingston.
"Brennan: Cool, you go over to Kingston. Kingston's head's on a swivel, you're looking around. You've clocked Pete having this interaction."
Lou: Do I recognize this man?
Brennan: You don't recognize this man.
Lou: Okay.
"Kingston: Pete, what's going on?"
"Pete: What the fuck? Okay, we have to talk, bro. We can't talk here."
"Kingston: Okay, you wanna dance?"
Pete: Yeah. Of course I do!
"Kingston: Great, we can dance and talk."
"Ally: So, we're dancing."
"Misty: Come on, dance!"
"Pete: Oh, this is perfect. Okay, dude, do you see those crazy people over there?"
Kingston: [doing the Cabbage Patch dance] Yeah.
"Pete: So, you know the girl who looked really sad?"
Kingston: [doing the robot] Uh-huh.
"Pete: Okay, I detected her thoughts. It seems like those other three really pale people with her are vampires."
Kingston: Okay.
Pete: They make her do a bunch of drugs and then they suck her blood to get high off of her.
"Kingston: Okay, that's not that crazy."
"Pete: No, the fuckin' crazy thing is—"
"Kingston: Hey, keep dancing."
"Pete: This isn't dance? All right, [dancing] so you know that older guy?"
Kingston: Uh-huh.
Pete: I think that that was maybe my dad.
Kingston: What?
Pete: I'm not sure what happened. Something fucking happened--
Kingston: I've never seen that man before.
"Pete: Okay, my dad is a motherfucking dickhead. And he [laughs] he said [stammering] someone helped me by making bubbles come out of his mouth and taking him away."
Kingston: So he knew what you had done to your father?
Pete: This old guy knew what had happened to my dad.
Kingston: [doing the wave] Have you told anyone else about your dad?
"Pete: I don't know, who have I… No, I think I told Alejandro about what happened to my dad, I think? I'm not sure. Do you guys remember me telling this story about my dad and the bubbles?"
Kingston: I don't think we've heard this before.
"Misty: It's cool though, gotta say. If you can teach me that trick, that's cool, I would do that."
"Pete: [dancing] I think I told you guys, because then someone was like, we can kill him if you want. And I said yeah, please go ahead and kill my dad."
Kingston: Somebody in your head?
"Pete: Yeah, whoever Lazarus is, someone evil did this to me, and I let them."
"Kingston: Okay, I don't like this man in the corner. Misty, you got any thoughts? [doing the wave]"
"Misty: No, I don't know."
Kingston: I don't know how I feel--
Ally: Is he still there? Can I look over and see if he's still there?
Misty: I feel like I would know everybody at this wedding…
"Kingston: Yeah, exactly."
"Brennan: You see that he's now speaking, he's talking to Don Confetti over in the corner. They're kind of chatting and laughing with each other."
"Pete: [gasps loudly] Dude, dude, okay. So, I dunno if this is crazy, okay."
"Kingston: [while dancing, chastising] Pete. Pete."
"Pete: He, okay, I've got to keep dancing. [putting his hands up] So, what I think happened is, you guys know how we keep hearing Lazarus is like, ""I'm leaving today.”"
Kingston: Uh-huh. You keep hearing it and keep telling us about it.
"Pete: But anyway! So my dad got carried away because he was a piece of shit, and I was fine with it, but what if this Lazarus guy took over his soul or something? And then used that fountain to, like, clean it? Something happened with that fountain and cleaning bad people."
"Kingston: I dunno. Misty, do you wanna use your connections with Don Confetti to go over, have him introduce you to this man?"
Misty: That's a great idea.
Kingston: Try something like that.
"Brennan: Checking in with the other people at the wedding, what are you guys up to?"
Murph: I guess we'll go join these. We see the whole group.
Emily: I'm wasted and trying to start a conga line. But no-one understands what I'm doing.
Ally: They're all so small!
"Murph: In that case, I grab Sofie."
"Kugrash: Sofie, you doin' okay?"
"Emily: I'm trying to start a conga line, but with their heads."
Zac: I'm dancing with my date. She's just sort of on my chest.
"Brennan: This buff, hot firefighter with a pigeon on his chest?"
Siobhan: It's like my necklace.
"Emily: I'm gonna snap a picture of that and send it to the girls at the salon, and be like, Mr. March has a girlfriend!"
"Zac: But dancing towards them, yeah."
"Siobhan: I go over to that table, and I'm like,"
"Misty: Don, who's your friend?"
"Siobhan: And I do that old old lady creep, arm around the waist on this guy."
"Brennan: Cool, make a Persuasion check for me, if you'd be so kind."
Siobhan: I would love to.
Sofia: Can we say that you guys filled us in on what you're talking about?
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: And if you could make that check with disadvantage.
"Siobhan: All right, that was a 16. And this is a 13, so 23."
"Brennan: 23, cool. You slide your arm around the guy. Feels like a human dude. Older, middle aged kind of human guy. You see that Don Confetti says,"
"Don Confetti: Oh, Misty Moore. I'm surprised you have not already met my friend Robert. Robert, please say hi to Misty."
"Brennan: You see this guy Robert turns to you and says,"
"Robert: Ah, Miss Moore. It's a pleasure to meet you."
"Misty: Charmed, I'm sure!"
Siobhan: And I give him my hand like this.
"Brennan: Kisses your hand. You see that Don says,"
"Don Confetti: Misty is, of course, a very accomplished stage actress. She is very famous."
"Brennan: You see that Robert nods and says,"
Robert: I've seen some of your performances. What a knockout.
"Misty: Thank you so much, it's always great to meet… I don't even like the word fan, but people who enjoy my work. You know, we live in a city of artists. That's why we're here, you know? It's so important to experience so many of the things in the city that people miss out on. So what do you do?"
"Robert: Oh, I work in finance. I'm a friend of the Don's."
"Misty: Oh, fantastic. You know, finance is also a great hub of the city. Artists, we wouldn't be able to survive without the finance guys. I mean, all of us would love to buy into this starving artist myth, where you have to be starving to make art. But let's be realistic. When you have a nice bed, everything's a little easier. You know what I mean?"
"Robert: And I doubt you've been starving for some time, Miss Moore."
"Misty: Well, you know, starving is relative. Broke is relative, you know what I mean? But I do fine, I do fine."
"Robert: Mmm, I'm sure."
"Brennan: You see he looks over. The vampires and the young girl, who now is bone pale and having a hard time standing. They come out wiping their mouths. Sit back down, and Robert looks over at you and says,"
"Robert: Well, you'll have to excuse me. It looks like the other vampires have come back."
Brennan: And he turns around and walks away from you.
Misty: It's been a pleasure!
"Brennan: Don looks over and says,"
"Don Confetti: Yes, it has been a pleasure. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and verbally harass the DJ because he is playing a bunch of duds and these songs, they are too hard to dance to. I will be right back."
"Misty: Don, you've gotta come dance with me though. [does a strange, jerky dance]"
"Don Confetti: I will do what I can. But know this, I only do this because you have asked this favor of me on the day of my daughter's wedding."
Brennan: And he zips away.
Siobhan: Did I use up my favor? I could've had anything in the world.
"Emily: Can I… I've heard that something's gone on with this girl. It looks really predatory, her surrounded by these dudes and her looking faint. I think as a woman in her 30s, I'm looking at her being like, I would like to try to help her out. I feel maternal towards her. So I'm gonna go over there and just say,"
"Sofia: I'm so sorry, I need help getting out of this dress to pee. D'you guys mind if I borrow this sweet girl? It's such a nightmare getting out of this dress to pee. So I need a friend in the bathroom."
"Brennan: You see the young woman looks up at you and looks at the other people here and says,"
"Melissa: I'm so sorry, I'm fine, thank you."
"Sofia: Oh, I'm not worried about you, I'm worried about me. And peeing, and..."
Brennan: Give me a Persuasion check.
Emily: 10.
"Brennan: You see that she looks and says,"
Melissa: I'm fine thanks.
"Brennan: Pete, are you still reading her mind?"
"Ally: Mm-hm. Or, well, am I?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I believe probably you are. You read in her mind that she actually doesn't want to leave the table. She feels afraid and shitty and fucked up but is also choosing to be here in some regard or another."
"Ally: Okay, cool. I think I go up to Sof and I'm like,"
Pete: Did I overhear you need some help in the bathroom?
Sofia: Yes.
Pete: They're gender-neutral at this wedding. I can go with you.
"Sofia: Okay, great. That'd be so helpful, thank you so much. If you ever need a haircut, you have beautiful hair."
Emily: And I give her my business card.
Brennan: Can you give me a Deception check as well?
Emily: A 9.
"Brennan: You see that Robert speaks up and says,"
"Robert: Now, forgive me for being blunt, but you folks aren't worried for the safety of my companion Melissa here, are you?"
"Sofia: Okay, I'm just gonna lay it out there. First off, I'm a little drunk, because I'm going through a divorce, and it's hard to be at a wedding. Second off, if I see a young woman surrounded by men who's looking a little sick to her stomach at a place where alcohol is being imbibed at an alarming rate, I'm gonna step in and make sure she didn't get roofied."
"Brennan: You see he nods, looks around. He says,"
"Robert: Melissa, you're free to go. If you wanna go."
"Brennan: She looks at him and says,"
Melissa: don't wanna go.
"Ally: I pop in like,"
Pete: She looks like she's having a great time. You guys look like you're having a great time. Sofie...
Sofia: Sorry! I just wanted to make sure someone didn't get roofied.
Pete: And we need more strong women like you.
Sofia: Thank you.
Pete: Right?
Sofia: Now will you help me get out of my dress so I can pee?
"Pete: Yeah, of course!"
"Brennan: And Robert says,"
"Robert: While we're handing out business cards, Jeffrey, you ever wanna talk…"
"Brennan: You see he hands you a business card. His name doesn't appear on it, but it has a address and the name of a prominent hedge fund on it."
Ally: It doesn't say Robert?
Brennan: It does not say Robert.
Ally: Just hedge fund.
Brennan: It's like a business's business card. Doesn't have his name on it.
Siobhan: Do either of you have Detect Good and Evil?
Lou: I do not.
"Zac: I mean, I have Protection from that."
"Siobhan: Oh, you have Protection but not Detect."
Ally: I feel like I had that but I don't have it.
"Murph: They're vampires. They're bad, right?"
Zac: I'm still dancing.
"Ally: I'm really triggered by the bubbles comment still, with my dad, and I'm just seething."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: I don't know what I'm doing. But I know I'm angry.
Emily: That interaction shook me back into place. I'm no longer as upset about the wedding.
Ally: I'm explaining to you all the Detect Thought stuff on how she actually wanted to be there. So there's some sort of weird setup.
Brennan: Is Kugrash watching this?
"Murph: Yeah. I think we're all kind of circled up. I think once these guys started dancing, I think we all kind of came together. And then over here."
"[eerie, ambient, piercing drone]"
Brennan: Cool. You look at this guy Robert. You've met this guy before.
Ally: What?
Brennan: You met this guy a long time ago.
Murph: What do I know about him?
"Brennan: You know that he's a very powerful, very dangerous guy who you only met in passing one time."
Murph: Okay. Does he know Gabriela?
Brennan nods.
Murph: Okay.
Siobhan: Who's Gabriela?
"Kugrash: Eh, you know, it doesn't matter. This guy is bad news."
"Sofia: Okay, I have a theory. I have a theory based off of what Pete said. They're laundering souls and selling them to the soulless."
Ricky: What?
Kugrash: That's kind of brilliant.
Misty: That's so intense.
"Sofia: That's what I think they're doing. They're stealing souls and then cleaning them in the Bethesda Fountain, and then selling them to people who don't have souls."
Kugrash: Like vampires.
Sofia: Like selling passports.
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Ally: I'm so… I don't know if this is too ridey about this. But I think I'm so worked up about this Robert guy and he knows something about my dad, and I'm talking to them, and I'm like, that fucking guy knows something about my dad. And when I point, I activate True Strike. Is that possible?"
"Brennan: Awesome, yeah. That's great."
Ally: 'Cos I know it takes a whole turn.
Brennan: Roll wild magic for me.
"Ally: Fuck, great. One and two?"
"Brennan: One and two, yeah."
Ally: Six.
Emily: Hey!
"Kugrash: All right everybody. Let's get Pete, let's calm down."
"Pete: Okay, all right."
Kugrash: Let's everybody--
"Kingston: We about ready to go, right?"
Sofia: We are depleted. We already had a battle today.
Misty: I could do a nap.
Murph: Does he look the same as he did back then?
"Brennan: He does, yep."
Kugrash: He's a vampire.
"Ricky: But in your story, you said you didn't see him drinking the blood. It was the other three."
"Pete: Yeah, yeah, so this guy--"
Sofia: To get high.
Pete: I think this guy--
"Brennan: You guys are, by the way, talking very loudly at the wedding right now."
"Kingston: Hey, everybody, why don't we go back to my place? All right?"
"Pete: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Misty: Hey, macarena!"
Ally: We grab her.
Brennan: You guys bounce—
"Emily: As we leave, I just want to write a really long, really heartfelt, way too intimate thing in the wedding book."
Ally: The guestbook?
Zac: Take the wedding book.
"Siobhan: Take it, take the wedding book!"
"Emily: Okay, well you guys can take me. I'm writing, I'm still writing in the wedding book."
"Lou: Guys, don't get us killed for a wedding book."
"Emily: No, I'm writing. I'm writing about the beauty of marriage."
Lou: Can I leave a $50 check as a gift?
"Brennan: Absolutely, you may, yes."
Murph: I wanna just give a head-nod or a little salute to that guy to see how he reacts to me.
Brennan: He has no recognition of you at all and looks very confused.
Murph: Okay.
"Siobhan: I leave a couple of tickets for opening night of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream""."
Kingston: You just carry those around?
Ally: Always be promoting.
Misty: Don’t you?
Murph: I add my name to her card.
Ally: A Kugrash paw.
Emily: I ask the wedding planner if there's another guestbook 'cos I've filled this one up.
"Brennan: You guys proceed to bounce. You see that as you're all getting ready to leave, Perry comes over to you, Kugrash."
"Perry the Pigeon: Hey, uh… What's going on?"
"Kugrash: Hey, we gotta head out."
[sad piano music]
Perry the Pigeon looks sadly down at the floor.
Kugrash: God damn it.
Murph: I kiss him.
"[Perry yelping excitedly, cooing and fluttering]"
"Ally: They're making out. We're like,"
"Pete: Kugrash, we gotta go."
Ricky: Incredible.
Sofia: Oh my god.
Siobhan: I have one more thing.
Emily: I adjust my contact so I can see better.
"Kugrash: I know I'm leading him on, but I feel like we've got a short-term..."
"Kingston: Sometimes you've gotta do the nice thing, not the right thing."
"Kugrash: Right, yeah."
Siobhan: Do vampires show up in photographs? 'Cos they don't show up in mirrors. Do vampires show up in photographs?
"Brennan: I don't think think they show up in photographs, no."
"Siobhan: Great, so can we take a selfie with the vampires and Robert in the background?"
Brennan: Yes.
[Emily cheering]
Ally: A photo booth photo? Oh yeah.
Murph: See if Robert's a vampire? That's brilliant.
"Ricky: [composing a text] Esther, this is me at the wedding."
Pete: Don't send it to anyone!
Zac: And then I look at the picture.
"Brennan: At that table, Melissa shows up, the young woman. And Robert shows up."
"Ally: Okay, okay."
"Emily: Oh, so he does show up!"
"Kingston: Okay, right, everybody. Back to my house, let's go."
"Brennan: You guys dip, arriving back at Kingston's."
[Map noise]
Brennan: What do you guys do when you get there?
Pete: Fuck that guy.
"Misty: You think your mother has any cinnamon rolls baking, or some kind of—"
Kingston: My mother?
Lou: What time is it?
Brennan: It's probably 11:00 at night.
"Kingston: My mother should be in bed. I promise you, if I went down and asked for cinnamon rolls, she would wake up and cook them. But we're not doing that."
"Ricky: Do you have any deli meats, or anything? I just sorta snacked on tiny pixie food."
"Lou: What do I have in my— Let's see, I have a bunch of fresh vegetables. And can I make—"
Brennan: You can make a big salad.
"Lou: Yeah, I make a big salad. Lots of baby spinach. I chop up some tomatoes, some bell peppers."
Misty: You go to the farmers' market for this?
"Kingston: Of course I go to the farmers' market! I'm all about celebrating, you know. I buy local."
Ally: I'm on your page. I start making some hummus in a food processor with you.
"Lou: Yeah, we're all just cooking. We're all wet in nice clothes, cooking."
Sofia: I'm making eggplant rollatini.
Ally: Us three bumping elbows in the kitchen.
Misty: You go to Queens for this mozzarella? It's delicious.
"Kingston: I mean, of course. Only the best."
Zac: Can I just as a precaution use Divine Sense to see if there's any...
"Brennan: You scan the place, no. Kingston's apartment seems okay. You do detect a very strong undead presence on the top of the refrigerator."
"Kingston: It's the mummy, all right? It's just the mummy, all right?"
Kugrash: You have a mummy?
Sofia: Is this what the obsidian ankh is about?
"Kingston: Yeah, it's from when we fought the mummy back in Long Island, you know?"
"Misty: Oh, darling, it was so much fun. The stories we have."
"Kingston: Yeah, it was wild."
"Pete: I have nightmares really easily. What, what...?"
"Kingston: Well, if you have nightmares easily, shouldn't we not tell you the scary thing we did?"
"Misty: Yah, let’s not tell him about the scary thing."
"Kugrash: Yeah, guys--"
"Misty: Anyway, the Metropolitan Museum has so much fascinating stuff, and it's free! I mean, it's not free, it's suggested donation, but if you pay for the Metropolitan Museum, you're a goddamn fool."
"Pete: The Met isn't free anymore. They changed it, it's $25."
"Zac: I have my phone out, and I'm doing a little seven-minute workout."
Brennan: Great.
"Kingston: Okay, great. Everybody's settled, we've got salad on the table. Eggplant rollatinis and fresh-made hummus. What's going on?"
"Kugrash: This guy, I know this guy from the 80s and he hasn't aged. So whether or not he's a vampire, he's somethin'."
"Sofia: May I ask you, Misty? And before when I mentioned your age—"
Ally: I'm doing this.
"Sofia: Before, I was scolded at by a man who tried to snort human remains. So, you know, let's let that sit with everyone. But are you a vampire, or is there a way to be immortal that Ronald could be a..."
"Misty: Darling, I'm a faerie."
"Sofia: So, is Ronald possibly a faerie?"
Pete: Robert.
Sofia: Robert.
"Misty: I mean, it's possible. But I have never met this man before in my life, and the faerie community in New York City is pretty tight. I mean, look, I'm friends with Don Confetti, and that guy's not a great dude, but he's one of my people, you know? You've gotta stick together."
Sofia: I see.
"Kingston: Kugrash, I hate to pin it to you, man. But you know this guy from the 80s how?"
"Kugrash: [rubbing his hands together nervously] Ah, yeah, ah. He is… He hangs out around humans. I don't think he hangs out around this type. I think he hangs out in the real world."
Ricky: I feel like you're not telling us something.
"Sofia: Yeah. In what context did you meet him? Did you, I don't know, get caught in a rat-trap in his apartment?"
"Misty: Oh, okay, let's not be rude."
"Kugrash: Yeah, that's not—"
"Pete: Was that rude? I'm on your page now, sorry."
Sofia: Apparently.
"Kingston: Kug, we're not trying to put you in a space you don't wanna be put in. But this seems to be something."
Kugrash: [quickly] I wasn't always a rat.
Kingston: [gasps] What?
Pete: What?
[somber jazz music]
"Kugrash: I wasn't, I wasn't always a rat."
Pete: You chose to be a rat?
Kugrash: I didn't. From what?
"Ricky: Were you like, a parrot or a turtle?"
"Kugrash: No, I was a human. I was a guy."
Kingston: What?
Misty: What?
Kingston: You were a dude named Kugrash?
Misty: That is exactly what my question was!
Kingston: Who names their child Kugrash?
Kugrash: My name is not...
"Ricky: Were you, like, a stockbroker?"
Kugrash: Yeah.
Ricky: Really?
Sofia: What was your name? What'd your name used to be?
"Kugrash: My name, my real name, is Bruce."
Kingston: What?
Sofia: Bruce what?
Kugrash: Kugrich.
"Emily: Okay, can I go on Google and search Bruce Kugrich?"
"Brennan: Uh, yeah go ahead and make a Investigate check."
Kingston: This is huge for me right now!
Pete: This is crazy.
Kingston: I'm looking at a rat man that used to be a full man named Bruce.
Pete: And he's wearing a crown.
Emily: I got a 4! Is there another Bruce Kugrich?
Brennan: There's an extremely successful movie horse breeder named Bruce Kugrich out in Los—
Ally: Horse breeder!
"Brennan: He breeds horses for movies, show horses."
Emily: I show everyone.
"Sofia: Oh my god, you breeded horses?"
Kingston: That's why you're so good with animals! This all makes sense!
"Ricky: How d'you get into that kind of job? It has to be your parents or something, right?"
"Misty: Family job, right? Horse-breeding? Movie horse-breeding?"
Pete: Wow.
"Kugrash: Point is, I'm Kugrash now, but I knew this man in my old life."
"Pete: Look, I'm a drug dealer, man. It's fine, just tell us everything about who you used to be and how you knew this guy."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Kugrash: Y'know, that part of my life is behind me, I wasn't--"
"Misty: Look, darling. We've all had different lives. Let me tell you about my good friend John Wilkes Booth. He was a fabulous actor."
Kingston: That's a big drop.
Misty: Fabulous!
Kugrash: I'll say it wasn't as bad as John Wilkes Booth.
"Ricky: If we're all admitting secrets, I wasn't always a firefighter."
"Brennan absolutely loses it, snickering."
"Ricky: I was in high school, and then after high school I became a firefighter."
Misty: That's not a secret. That's just a normal life.
"Kingston: You lived, is what you're saying."
"Sofia: Two phases, high school and then firefighter? Or are you leaving something out?"
Ricky: And then firefighter. And community college for a year and a half.
"Brennan: You get a text on your phone, Ricky, from Esther. It says,"
Esther: At Clinton Hill Chantry with Alejandro. We may have found something. Are you with Pete?
"Zac: Text,"
"Ricky: That's awesome. With Pete right now. How are you? Yeah, sorry, go ahead."
"Brennan: The text back says,"
"Esther: If all of you guys are there, you should come here at your nearest convenience. You can come tonight if you need to, or tomorrow."
"Misty: I mean, I'm pretty tired."
Kingston: I just made this big salad.
"Sofia: Honestly, I've got so much rollatini in me."
"Ricky: I'm worried. We can go tonight or tomorrow, but, I don't know, I have a bad feeling."
"Pete: Yeah, I kinda do too."
Kugrash: Let's go.
"Sofia: All right, let's go."
Kugrash: Let's go tonight.
Pete: Salad and hummus and rollatini to go?
Sofia: I'll get the Tupperware!
"Brennan: Cool, it's midnight. You guys hop on the subway to head all the way to--"
"Ally: I'm hopped up on coke, so."
Emily: Yeah.
Ally: I'm good to go.
"Brennan: You guys get on the train, you're heading out."
[train clattering on tracks]
Brennan: It's a long ride from here to Brooklyn.
Emily: Can we take a short rest on the train?
"Brennan: Absolutely, you can all take a short rest on the train."
Ally: I'm listening to The Prodigy.
Lou: I just keep stealing looks at Kugrash trying to imagine what he looked like as a man. Did he have a big beard?
Ricky: I have an app that can give people makeup and stuff like that.
"Sofia: Yeah, let's do that."
"Kugrash: No, I wasn't, I wasn't two feet tall—"
Ricky: Just a smooth ball on him.
"Sofia: Oh my god, he's so handsome."
Ricky: He looked like this.
Pete: Wow!
Kingston: Kugrash looks like a thug!
"Sofia: Kug, your cheeks are so rosy."
"Kugrash: Yeah, you know."
Sofia: Your jawline's so pronounced.
Brennan: Wonderful.
[map noise]
"Brennan: You guys arrive at the Clinton Hill Chantry. Ricky, you're very familiar with this space. You walk up, you see that Frank is there on the front of the door. You see he looks up and goes,"
"Frank: Ay, there, Ricky Matsui, how's it goin' bud?"
"Ricky: Uh, pretty good. We just came from a wedding, it was beautiful."
"Frank: Oh, beautiful! Who got hitched?"
Ricky: A pigeon and a little fairy.
"Frank: Beautiful, I love it. Que bella."
"Brennan: You see, he says,"
"Frank: Well, I bet you understand that Esther and Alejandro have been working their butts off in there, so. Oh, got a bunch of new friends. Hello, I'm Frank, I'm a gargoyle. I'm only a head, and I'm living on this door forever. So, that's about me."
"Misty: How's it going, Frank? It's been a while."
"Frank: Oh, Misty! It's good to see ya!"
"Misty: Good to see you, it's always good to see you, Frank."
"Frank: Well, you look good, I gotta say. By the way, I wanted to mention something. You think you could get tickets for me to come see your show? I can't make it 'cos I'm stuck to this door but I'd just like, you know."
"Misty: Oh, yeah, and you know, I was thinking. I have friends who've been looking for an actor to play the part of Jacob Marley's face in ""A Christmas Carol""? And they've been looking high and low, and I was like, I know somebody who could do that. He's perfect for the part. So I can send your information along to them, if you would like."
"Frank: Oh my god, would you do that?"
"Misty: Absolutely! For you, absolutely."
"Frank: I can't believe it! Yeah, that'd be great! Jacob Marley, I wear the chains forged of life!"
"Misty: Through acts of greed, absolutely!"
Ricky: Sounds like a play.
"Brennan: [laughs] Frank is elated. You guys enter the Clinton Hall Chantry. Much smaller and less metaphysically intense space. This is just a three-story brownstone that is the same size on the inside as it is on the outside, for the most part. You guys walk in, you see the missing glass plane where the questing blade popped out. You walk into a large library room. This is one of those library rooms that it's books lining every single wall, and one of those giant tables. You know, it's like a study table that could fit 40 people at it. In the center, these [exhaling heavily] lamps shedding golden light over the table. You clearly see Alejandro and Esther, they did not sleep last night. They have not been asleep since. They've just been here, books all over the table everywhere, coffee cups everywhere. You see Alejandro's flat-cap is off. He's got his shirt rolled up. Esther's the same way, you see she's got a little thing of coffee in her hands. They both look up, Esther says,"
"Esther: Great, you're here. You made it, awesome. Great, great, great. We think we may have found something."
"Brennan: Alejandro looks over and says,"
"Alejandro: And there I beheld him, an aspect of, no, sorry. Her. No, no, it. There, I beheld it, an aspect of a gray child that I had searched for for many long years. This being Nod, the realm and the being, monarch of the sixth borough. The child, the gray orphan, the spirit of the dreaming realm beyond the streets of the city I have known."
Sofia: So the dream world is the sixth borough.
[Peter clearing throat]
Alejandro: This gray baby...
"Ricky: Sorry, what is it called?"
Alejandro: This gray baby.
Ricky: Oh.
"Sofia: Sorry, one more time."
Alejandro: How many languages do you guys all speak?
Kingston: I speak some French.
Pete: Just English and some Spanish—
Sofia: Can't I just admire it and enjoy it?
"Ally: Oh, I feel really bad, and I pull out--"
Alejandro: I speak five different languages fluently. I have a bit of an accent. But this gray baby—
Pete: And it's true.
Ally: I hand him a bunch of Juul stuff that I grabbed when we were at home.
"Alejandro: Oh, wow!"
"Pete: This one's cucumber picante. It's amazing, you're gonna fuckin' love it."
"Alejandro: This is really good. Honestly, a lot of the flavors come with cucumber, but I'm into it, it's—"
Kingston: [disapprovingly] Alejandro. What does that gray baby stuff mean?
Brennan: You see that he does a little Mage Hand thing and replaces the cell in the Juul. Puts it in and goes… [taking a drag]
"Kingston: Alejandro, I hate this. You know I hate this. You know I hate this! You're gonna get popcorn lung. You're gonna get popcorn lung, and then what you gonna do about it?"
"Brennan: [bubbling] You see that it goes up, and he makes a little smoke Empire State Building with a King Kong on it, going like this, that floats away."
Pete: That's sick.
Ricky: Amazing.
"Alejandro: It is sick, isn't it?"
Pete: That's sick.
"Alejandro: This gray baby is Nod, the gray orphan. This spirit is… to the degree that a realm of chaos, such as the realm of dream, can have order. Nod is the spirit of hope, and dreams. Nod is sometimes referred to as the monarch of the sixth borough. That you have met Nod is remarkable. Do you remember what the gray orphan said to you?"
"Ally: Uh, yeah, yeah. The gray orphan said a couple of different things. Once they said, ""Everyone who ever came here had a dream."" And, oh god. I didn't, I don't know what else they said."
Zac: What was that Lazarus thing?
Siobhan: I have something right here.
"Ally: Well, Lazarus said—"
"Brennan: Esther speaks up and points at Ricky and says,"
"Esther: We, by the way, have been combing for Lazarus. The gray orphan is never referred to as Lazarus, any time we've been able to find any writings about anything happening."
"Pete: I think they're different, yeah."
Misty: Heed the words of Lazarus before it's too late.
"Brennan: Alejandro sort of twirls his mustache and says,"
Alejandro: We have not found any reference to a Lazarus in the Dreaming.
Misty: But Lazarus is in the Bible. Could it be the biblical Lazarus? Raised from the dead?
"Sofia: Raised from the dead. I have a question. So, the dream world is referred to as the sixth borough. Is there a time in history, Alejandro or Esther, where the dream world was more tangible and more accessible to the other five boroughs?"
"Brennan: You see that Esther nods and says,"
Esther: The dream world becomes extremely active and tangible in the presence of the arrival of a Vox Phantasma.
Misty: Also you can take the L and go really far.
Esther: But you have to go all the way to the end.
"Misty: Past Canarsie, it's long."
"Sofia: Okay, I think I went to a Curves out there one time."
Pete: You can't do that any more.
Esther: And I think you can't do that on weekends right?
"Pete: Yeah, or a night."
"Misty: It's that weird, it's a shuttle bus situation."
"Esther: Yeah. You can get a shuttle bus, but the shuttle bus can only be seen by the pure of heart, so it's hard."
"Misty: It's a whole deal. But they do have these tiny little buns. I can't remember the name of them. Anyway it's worth the trip, but just."
Sofia: Dream buns?
"Pete: The baby, do we know..."
"Brennan: Alejandro looks over at you and says,"
Alejandro: The biblical Lazarus is not a bad place to guess. There are beings within the city that would have some knowledge of these things.
"Sofia: What would happen if you raise someone from the dead? Would they have a soul, or would they been in need of a soul? Perhaps a laundered soul?"
"Brennan: See, Alejandro shrugs and says,"
Alejandro: It depends on the manner of their raising.
"Sofia: If they were raised by infernal, or perhaps nefarious means?"
"Alejandro: It is possible to consider this, yes. Kingston."
Kingston: Mm.
Alejandro: There are some beings in the city that are aware of such biblical things. I do not concern myself as much with religions. I deal with the study of the arcane. But I'm trying to think of people in the city that would—
"Kingston: Oh, Willy?"
"Brennan: You see that he looks at you and says,"
Alejandro: Willy?
Kingston: The golem.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Alejandro: The golem of Williamsburg might know something, yes, this is very true. I think it would be wise… Peter, would you be amenable to perhaps going to sleep on the table here and allowing myself and Esther to keep a watch on you with our third eye while you venture into the Dreaming?"
Pete: Sure.
Alejandro: That might be for the best. Something very strange is afoot.
"Brennan: You see Esther looks up and says,"
Esther: I don't think going to Willy's a bad idea. I think that makes sense.
"Misty: Also, Bethesda Fountain has been compromised. We sent the angel down to Washington Square Park, so—"
"Pete: Oh yeah, we have, uh. I don't know if this is for you guys can use. But we have a bunch of ashes that we recovered of human remains."
"Brennan: Esther takes those, nods."
"Ally: One of 'em's cocaine, I made a mistake. But we don't know that."
"Brennan: Esther takes them, says,"
"Esther: I'll take a look into this. For those of you that need to rest, you should go ahead and rest. Pete, if you want to stay with Alejandro."
"Emily: I think I have to see my brother, maybe tomorrow. Did I say I was gonna see him tomorrow?"
Brennan: You didn't specify a time.
"Emily: Well, I'd like to see him, so I think I'm gonna head back to Staten Island."
"Brennan: Cool, you head back to Staten Island. You're gonna stay in the Chantry. What's everybody else doing?"
"Murph: I wanna mention something to, I just wanna kind of pull Esther aside for a sec. And then be like,"
"Kugrash: Hey, I know this is kind of weird. But do you still see your mom?"
[sudden tense music]
Do you talk to your mom? What's she up to?
Esther: How do you know about my mom?
"Kugrash: Ah, we were friends a long time ago. Is she okay? What is--"
"Brennan: Make a Deception, or if you're trying to be deceptive."
"Murph: [blows out a breath] I don't have… No, I don't need to be deceptive."
"Kugrash: We were friends, but we're not friends any more."
"Brennan: She looks at you and says,"
Esther: I haven't seen my mom in a long time.
Kugrash: When was the last time you saw her?
"Esther: [sighs] Probably when I was, I don't know. Five, six. Even before that she was in and out."
"Kugrash: [nods, rubs his hands together] All right."
"Zac: I walk up and pull out my phone. I'm like,"
"Ricky: Oh Esther. I was gonna send you this picture from the wedding. It was crazy, it was beautiful, but then we had to fight some rats or something. Uh, but do you guys recognize this guy? This old guy, in the picture?"
Esther: I don't recognize him. But we can take a look.
Ricky: He was hanging out with some vampires.
"Esther: Huh, all right. There's a lot of ground to cover. Ricky, d'you wanna stay here with me?"
"Ricky: Yeah. I mean, yes."
"Esther: Awesome. It'd be good to have someone here in case anything goes down, because we don't know what's going to happen with Pete."
"Brennan: Rest of you guys, it's getting late. You guys did have a full fight against the rat king, what are you guys up to?"
Lou: I'm good to go. I can go see Willy right now.
"Brennan: Cool, you're gonna head to Willy. You're going to Staten Island. Uh, Misty and Kugrash. What are you guys up to?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm gonna go back to my apartment. I'm gonna probably call my show's director on the way and be like,"
"Misty: Look, yes, I know I'm missing rehearsal! But look, darling, I already know the steps. Do it without me! Give the understudy a chance to practice!"
Murph: And I'll go to the tunnels.
"Sofia: But I wanna let Kug know, if you wanna come..."
"Kugrash: I appreciate it. I gotta, yeah. I'm good."
Sofia: All right.
"Brennan: Rad, you guys all split up, go back to your various places."
"Siobhan: What was that fuckin Wisdom saving throw for? I'm still, like…"
Brennan chuckles.
"Ally: Yeah, same. Who rolled poorly on it?"
Zac: I got a one.
Ally: On the wisdom?
"Zac: Or like a four and then a one, yeah."
"Brennan: Let's see who's the closest to where they're headed. Well, Ricky, you're just staying here. So Ricky and Pete are staying at the Clinton Hill Chantry. You see that Alejandro says,"
"Alejandro: All right, we'll get a little pillow for you here, Peter. And we have some sleepy-time tea for you."
"Pete: That's great, I was gonna ask for tea. That's so great."
"Alejandro: Hey, sympatico, eh? There you go."
"Brennan: And you see he says,"
"Alejandro: Now, be lulled into slumber."
"Ally: I pull out Instagram. I'm like,"
Pete: I'm gonna be up for another hour and a half.
"Brennan: He says,"
"Alejandro: No, no, no. Be lulled into..."
Brennan: One eye goes gold.
Alejandro: [forcefully] Slumber.
"Ally: I am immune to sleep-related harm, would this be harm?"
"Brennan: You see that he stares and nothing happens to you. And he goes,"
"Alejandro: Okay, this is very embarrassing for me, because that always kinda works."
Pete takes a sip of his tea and scrolls Instagram.
Ally: I'm just liking everything.
"Alejandro: Okay, I'm gonna try a little harder. [strained] Ooh, go to sleep!"
"Brennan: And you see Esther says,"
Esther: Let's leave him.
"Brennan: Esther starts walking around with you in the chantry. This is, you're spending one-on-one time, just downtime with Esther. What's going on in Ricky's head right now?"
"Zac: Just like, you know. This is my shot, kind of."
[romantic piano music]
"Zac: She's so cool, and just thinking of trying to sound cool. So like,"
"Ricky: Yeah, there's a lot of books in here. I mean, I like to read too. We have some time in the fire station where I can knock out a book sometimes, so."
"Brennan: You see she sort of smiles and says,"
Esther: really?
"Ricky: Yeah. If you have any recommendations for a… I mean, I guess I don't read a ton, if I'm being completely honest. I'm open to it."
"Esther: Do you want one of these books, Ricky? Would these be fun for you?"
"Ricky: Sure, what's this one?"
Brennan: You pull out a huge book.
Ricky: Big.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Arcana check, if you'd be so kind."
"Zac: Uh, what's my Arcana? Well, I rolled a three, so probably. Yeah, three."
"Brennan: It is written in a language you do not speak, you have no fuckin' idea what this is."
"Ricky: Amazing, wow. Each page is, the letters are."
"Brennan: Make a Persuasion check for me, if you'd be so kind."
"Zac: Okay, 18."
"Brennan: 18? You see that Esther kind of leans against the table and like bites her finger, trying to stifle. She's trying not to be mean. She goes,"
Esther: [sighs] Would you like me to walk you through this book that you've chosen?
"Ricky: That'd be awesome, honestly."
"Esther: Okay, so this is a book of axioms. You know what an axiom is?"
Ricky: No.
"Esther: So, there's different references to it. It means a different thing in philosophy, for example, than it means in arcana. In arcana, an axiom refers to basically a law. A rule of magic."
Ricky: Cool.
Esther: You've opened it to a page that's actually very pertinent for casting magic in New York. It's the imperial axiom. Imperial...?
Ricky: Ax—
Esther: Empire?
"Ricky: Oh, empire rule."
"Esther: Yeah, the empire rule."
"Ricky: Right, oh, yeah."
"Brennan: You see that she's walking along. Give me an Insight check, by the way."
Zac: 8.
"Brennan: 8, cool. You end up going around, a little bit of a sense of something tingles at you, a little bit of your divine sense tingles as you're walking through a room. She looks at you and says, she's just babbling on, she goes, like,"
"Esther: So the imperial axiom basically states,"
"Brennan: And she looks at the book and says,"
"Esther: Because of the extreme difficulty of creating a permanent magical effect within the tumultuous arcane landscape of New York, an object or enchantment which is abjured or ensorcelled from being crafted—"
Ricky: Ensorcelled?
Esther: Yes.
"Ricky: Keep going, sorry."
"Esther: No, that's all right. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Object or enchantment which is abjured or ensorcelled from being crafted, conjured or created in a given location can be crafted, conjured or created in its abjured locality if it is first crafted, conjured or created within the five boroughs of New York City. And that's the imperial axiom. Also sometimes known as Sinatra's law."
"Ricky: Oh, um. So, I didn't understand that. I'm gonna be honest, but it sounded awesome, the way you said it."
"Esther: If a magical effect or object is barred or, I'm trying to think. There's lots of things that you can't do in certain places or for certain reasons they're abjured, they're barred, they're warded, yadda-yadda-yadda. However, because of the imperial axiom, if you are able to create or conjure that magical effect or object within the five boroughs of New York City, you can then conjure, craft or create it within the place that it is normally barred from being crafted or created. So it's just an interesting law of magic. There's tons of these that you have to learn and know about."
Ricky: It's like a loophole.
"Esther: It's a little loophole. But I mean, there's whole libraries full of loopholes."
"Brennan: You look up and get a really weird sense. You're looking at a giant map of the five boroughs of New York City, except that the highways on the map are in this sort of pulsing red. And your Divine Sense tingles a little bit."
"Ricky: So, what's the deal with this glowing map?"
Esther: Glowing map? Why don't you tell me what you think?
Brennan: Give me another Arcana check?
Zac: Two.
Esther: What do you think it is?
"Ricky: Well, so, these are the highways, right?"
Esther: Yeah.
"Ricky: And they're glowing. So that's, traffic's really bad right now."
Brennan: Give me another Persuasion check?
"Zac: Two. Wait, five."
"Brennan: Five? Do it with advantage, I'll give you a little inspiration here."
"Zac: Okay, 16."
"Brennan: You see that she just busts out laughing. And she says,"
"Esther: I'm sorry, I'm really not trying to be an asshole."
Ricky: It’s not traffic.
"Esther: It's not traffic, no. It's not traffic."
Ricky: I didn't feel like it was traffic.
"[mystical, chiming music]"
"Esther: No, it's not traffic. That's a good guess. That is actually a good guess. The loose term we have for it is the highway hex. Basically, unlike the subways and the bus routes that run basically with the grain of ley lines here in New York, a lot of the highways seem to run against it. And it actually creates the tumultuous arcane effect we were talking about when we were talking about the imperial axiom. You know, the BQE, the Major Deegan. A lot of these highways end up creating pathways of energies that dilute ley lines, which makes teleporting into and out of New York very difficult. It basically makes us a little bit more isolated."
Ricky: So it's like interference?
Esther: That's exactly right. It's like interference.
"Ricky: Nice. Cool, okay."
"Brennan: You see that she says,"
Esther: Absolutely.
"Ricky: So why, so this is just a map explaining that that exists?"
"Esther: Well, we don't understand a lot about it. We don't know. We're trying to figure it out as well. A lot of these things."
"Brennan: And you see she gets a sad look on her face. She says,"
Esther: A lot of these things are a work in progress.
Ricky: Does it have anything to do with the amount of people going back and forth?
"Esther: That's part of it. The traffic actually does a lot of the work of energy, because obviously, people have an inherent magic in them, even a person that can't see the Unsleeping City still has a heart and a soul. Kingston, your friend, gets his magic from real people every day."
Ricky: Wow. Wow.
"Brennan: You're stunned. She says,"
"Esther: I've been up for more than a day, so I think I'm gonna hit the hay. Let me show you your place."
"Ricky: Awesome, yeah."
"Brennan: She takes you to a little bunk in the chantry. She says,"
Esther: There should be shampoo and towels and stuff if you need it. Let me know if you need anything else.
"Ricky: Okay, uh, thanks."
Esther: And hey. I appreciate the scholarly effort.
"Ricky: Thanks, it's really hard for me."
"Brennan: She looks like her heart breaks, and she says,"
"Esther: I always thought you were a bit of a macho kinda guy. And you… I'm grateful that you ran into the fire and saved us all, but that's the kind of thing that guys like you do. No offense."
"Ricky: Oh, none taken."
"Brennan: She looks and says,"
"Esther: You trying to learn that stuff really is brave, and I'm not downplaying that."
"Ricky: Thanks, appreciate that."
Zac: Then I just take off my shirt.
[cast laughs]
Brennan: Make an Insight check?
"Zac: Uh, I got a 8."
"Brennan: She makes some kinda expression on her face and says,"
"Esther: [very quickly] Have a good night, Rick!"
"Brennan: And walks away down the hallway. Great, we're gonna cut over to our man Kingston Brown. Kingston, it's a short walk, actually, from here to Williamsburg. So you walk dead of night, one o' clock in the morning. What's going on on in Kingston's head as he walks to Williamsburg?"
[map noise]
"Lou: I think just a lot of trying to put the pieces together of Bethesda Fountain bullshit, the weird man at that fucking wedding, man, what's going on? What happened to New York that I love? I mean, I still love New York, but god damn. We were doing okay, and then Pete shows up. And he's a good kid, but come on. Everything seems to be going. Who's this gray baby? Alejandro's smoking again."
Brennan: Gimme an Investigate check.
Lou: Great. 19.
"Brennan: You know where you need to head. You go down by the waterfront, like Kent. You can look across the river and see Manhattan. You're walking up. You start to walk through this old neighborhood. It's southern Williamsburg, near the water. It's late at night. There's a lot of families in this neighborhood, so hardly any noise of anything happening. And you begin to hear a lumbering. [mimics heavy crashing] You round a corner, and you look and see an eight- foot-tall brick hulking golem. You see that the golem's eyes glow. [shuddering growl] And you see that it's digging through pavement for something. Turns around. [growls] Eyes glow, looks over at you."
"Kingston: What you lookin' for, Willy?"
"Willy: [very deep voice, Yiddish accent] Kingston Brown from uptown!"
"Kingston: Oh, what's going on, man?"
"Brennan: As he puts a hand up and [wham!] goes down, brings you in for a big hug. [stone scraping noises] Says,"
"Willy: you look good, Kingston Brown."
"Kingston: Hey, thank you, man, I appreciate. You don't look bad yourself. Redder than normal."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Willy: well, what can I say? Some rust from being down in the scrapyards. There are a couple of trolls that come by to bother Willy. Took all of a week to find them all."
"Kingston: That's tough, man, but how you doing? You living well, you good?"
Willy: I live by the might of God. I am happy to be animated still. You're looking thin. You eating still these days?
"Kingston: You know, my mom's trying to get me to eat more, but just between work and more work, and then the city and all that shit. Y'know, it's hard to make time. I made a salad tonight, and I didn't even get to eat all of it, 'cos I had to come down here."
"Willy: If you want, we should go by a bakery somewhere. I can move."
Brennan: You see that his bricks integrate with a wall next to him.
"Willy: I can move through the wall, grab maybe a bagel, a schmear, some lox. What do you want?"
"Kingston: I mean, yeah, yeah. No lox, just bagel with schmear."
"Brennan: He nods. [heavy crunching] Starts lumbering down the street. He says,"
"Willy: By the way, there is a nest of dybbuks nearby here. They are spectral, so hard for me to smash them. You mind to take a look?"
"Kingston: Yeah, of course. What are you, sorry, you're gonna have to say that again. You know, sometimes, the lack of a tongue and the fact that your mouth is mostly bricks, I have trouble—"
Willy: Should I have a tongue made of meat like someone who is a human?
Kingston: I'm not saying you've gotta have a tongue.
Willy: Why must you come down here to give me a hard time?
"Kingston: I did not come down here to fight with you about whether or not you have a tongue, all right."
Wally: I can tell you for a fact I don't. I should be so lucky to have a tongue.
"Kingston: Uh-huh, okay."
"Brennan: You go down the street, get to a bakery. You see that he melds with the brick wall, disappears for a second, and comes back out, [crunching] The bricks open up in his chest and you see a nice toasted everything bagel with a schmear on it."
"Kingston: Oh, thank you, Willy, this looks delicious."
"Wally: Ah, think nothing of it. It's important, you have to stay fed."
"Kingston: Yeah, I'm sorry, what were you gonna say?"
"Wally: There are a nest of dybbuks, ah, possessing spirits that are nearby. Would you mind just...?"
"Kingston: Yeah, of course, happy to."
Brennan: He takes you around the corner. You see for sure there's a hive in an old gutter of a building of just some very minor undead spirits that are hanging out there.
"Lou: Okay, I Turn Undead, or Destroy Undead?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you raise your hand. What do you say to this nest of dybbuks as you see it?"
"Kingston: All right. Get outta here, you damn dybbuks!"
Brennan: So they all fly away.
"Willy: And don't come back! Kingston, what a mitzvah. I appreciate you taking the time."
"Kingston: Of course, man, happy to help. You know, I wouldn't come down here at 1:00am just to say hello, y'know? You know I love a good bagel but it's late, and I should be sleeping. But I want to ask you. What's going on with Lazarus?"
Willy: Lazarus?
Kingston: Yeah.
Willy: Ugh. Some Christian schmuck in the Bible I think. What should I know for?
"Kingston: Well, I mean, it's just we've got something going on. You know that gray baby?"
Willy: Gray baby?
Kingston: You know the gray baby?
Willy: The gray baby? Why should a baby be gray? Take the baby to the hospital.
"Kingston: Hey, you're talking to a nurse, all right? I know babies should not be gray. Anyway, you know Nod, right?."
"Willy: Nod, yes, I know. I am a creature, of course, of the waking worlds, but."
"Kingston: Yeah, well there's something going down with Nod. And there's this gray baby that just keeps talking on and on about Lazarus. And you know, me and Alejandro and some of the other people were talking, we were like, who here knows about this religious stuff? So I thought to come to you."
"Willy: So this something in the Dreaming told you about this, what. Lazarus from the Bible?"
"Kingston: Yes, because. Oh, well, the other thing I forgot to mention is, you know Santa Claus, right? Santa Claus got his list stolen. And you know that both Satan and St. Peter have been using that same list. So—"
"Willy: Ah, what a mess."
"Kingston: Okay, Willy, we don't need to get into all of this Christian versus Jewish stuff, all right."
"Willy: You said it, not me, I was just saying."
"Kingston: All right, well, do you know anything about Lazarus? Or is there anything you've heard? Any rumblings?"
Willy: Lazarus… Are you sure that it's the Lazarus from the Bible?
"Kingston: Well, you got another Lazarus I should be looking into?"
Brennan: You see he looks out over the water. Beautiful snow across the water of the East River. And he looks out at the Statue of Liberty.
"Willy: Now, there."
Siobhan: [whispers] Emma Lazarus.
"Willy: Now, there is a woman. There was a woman once, Emma Lazarus. She wrote the poem inscribed in that divine, beautiful woman's book. [groans] Oh, the Statue of Liberty."
"Kingston: I'm sorry, Willy. Are you trying to get it on with the Statue of Liberty?"
"Willy: What, a golem can't dream?"
Kingston: I'm not saying that you… We just never talked about ladies before. I just didn't know.
"Willy: Well, what do you know? Your wife's a wooden shoe."
"Kingston: Oh, oh, okay. You wanna bring that up?"
"Willy: No, just saying."
"Kingston: You, oh, you just saying, all right."
"Willy: Listen, I don't mean to fight. You're a mensch. You come down, you help me with dybbuks. I'm happy to answer your question. I'm just saying, you tell me that is not a fetching statue?"
"Kingston: Okay, if a statue could… I'm personally not attracted to statues. But sure, that's a beautiful woman."
"Willy: What am, I chopped liver? I am not a handsome statue?"
"Kingston: We've never talked about being… I mean, do you think I'm an attractive man?"
Willy: You're a very handsome man. I have no problem saying.
"Kingston: Okay, fine. You're a very handsome stone golem."
Willy: That actually means a lot to me.
"Kingston: Okay, well, I'm sorry I didn't say it before."
"Willy: Well, you might start looking for Emma Lazarus. Kingston, shalom, my brother. It was good to see you."
"Kingston: Hey, thank you very much. Willy, poker sometime?"
"Willy: Oh, please, we missed you from the game! Come by any time."
Kingston: Be there.
Willy: Give my best to Victoria and Winston.
"Kingston: Of course. Have a good night, bub."
"Brennan: You see he nods, smiles. Heads off down the street. And you got a name. Kingston heads out. This is going to be our friend Sofia. You head back to Staten Island. You're on your way back to, I guess, your family's house."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Make a Perception check for me, if you'd be so kind."
Emily: Nat 20.
Ally: Fuck yeah!
Siobhan: At last!
Ally: Just out of the leopard box!
"Brennan: You're heading down the street, and before you can even realize it, you bump face-to-face with Isabella Infierno."
"Sofia: [under her breath] Oh, my god."
"Isabella: [Staten Island accent] Oh, my god. Sofia, running into you on the street. How you doing?"
Sofia: So late and you're by yourself.
"Isabella: Well, I was outta town."
"Brennan: And you see she picks up a bag. It's a bag from David's Bridal, and it has a wedding dress in it."
Emily: I vomit.
Sofia: You know you can't get married until I even see divorce papers? I haven't even gotten divorce papers yet.
Isabella: Oh?
Sofia: If this is about Dale.
Isabella: We don't need to have a legal wedding. A lot of what we do is really off the books. It's just a party for our friends and family to come and celebrate our love.
Emily: I tear open the thing to see her wedding dress.
"Brennan: Cool, make an Athletics check for me."
Murph: You should have went with her.
Ally: Oh my god.
"Emily: Oh my god, I got a 22."
Brennan: You snatch the dress out of her hand. It is the most beautiful gown.
Emily: I vomit again.
"Brenan: Isabella picks it up and says,"
"Isabella: Sofie. You're a fuckin' mess. I wish you the best, and listen. If you really want an invite, I'll be happy to send one your way."
Sofia: I actually would. I just came from a wedding and it was a really beautiful experience. I'm looking to add more to my weekends. Assuming you guys can afford getting married on a weekend. Or are you doing one of those Friday weddings.
Isabella: We're doing a destination wedding.
"Sofia: Oh, yeah?"
Isabella: Yeah.
Sofia: Where? Just so I know.
"Isabella: We're gonna go out all the way to Montauk, have a wedding on the beach. June."
Sofia: Dale hates the beach.
"Isabella: Yeah, but I love it, and he loves me. Bye, Sofie."
Brennan: You see she walks off down the street.
"Sofia: Just so you know, I woulda never guessed that Dale would do to me what he did to me. So this feeling of confidence and love that you have right now? Enjoy it while it lasts."
"Brennan: She shrugs, moves on."
"Ally: Wow, that's what a nat 20 gets you. Jesus Christ!"
Emily: I'm sweating at the palms.
Ally: Me too!
Brennan: What does Sofie do after that?
"Emily: Sofie had a really specific plan before she ran into Isabella Infierno. Lemme see if she can collect herself. I think I'm gonna look at my phone. Well, I wanted to contact two people. And I had this really specific thing. I was coming home being like, you know what? I'm gonna finally do it. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna empty the mailbox. I've been avoiding it 'cos I don't wanna see his name written on letters. Stuff is still coming here for him, but you know, I'm feeling empowered by my new friends, so I'm gonna finally do it. I don't know if I can now."
Brennan: Yeah.
Emily: So I might not do that.
Brennan: Give me a Wisdom save with disadvantage.
"Emily: Okay, with disadvantage. Okay, I did get a nat 20, but I also got a 2."
"Brennan’s jaw drops, shocked but sympathetic."
Siobhan: Oh fuck.
Ally: Fuck
"Emily: So, wisdom save is gonna be 5."
Brennan: Sofie needs a drink.
Sofia: Okay.
"Ally: Oh, no!"
"Emily: I'm gonna go to the bar. I feel like I had this really specific plan of what I wanted to do, and I don't know if I can even do it now after that exchange, like, roleplay wise. So I guess I'm gonna go to the bar, and I take out my phone, trying to do what I was planning on doing, but then instead, I'm just gonna text Dale."
Brennan: Cool. You get fuckin' lit. What do you text Dale?
"Emily: I think I just say,"
"Sofia: I hope you get sand between your ass cheeks at your fucking beach wedding, you dick."
"Emily: And then I delete it, I delete it, I delete it."
Brennan: Oh!
"Emily: And then I just say,"
Sofia: I wish you the best.
Ally: Aww!
"Emily: Then I send that. I say,"
"Sofia: I saw Isabella, I wish you the best."
[Brennan exhaling heavily]
"Emily: And then I order a shot, but as they're pouring the shot, I just take the bottle from them."
"Brennan: You just, woohoo, grab the bottle, yeah. You get fuckin' blasted."
Emily: I had all all this responsible detective work I wanted to do! And now it just feels so false for me to do that.
Brennan: I think that's the roleplaying choice. That's the roleplaying choice.
Emily: Never mind.
"Brennan: Misty, you arrive back at your lovely penthouse and you see a gift there."
"Misty: Oh, I love gifts!"
"Brennan: It's this huge, beautiful silk tarp over something very tall standing. Must be a piece of art or something."
"Siobhan: I don't even have Detect Magic. Fuck it, I'll open this present."
"Brennan: You whip the silk off, and a six-foot-tall beautiful standing mirror is here in your apartment."
Siobhan: I find the perfect place for it in my apartment.
Brennan: You set it up in your bedroom. Go ahead and give me a Charisma saving throw.
"Siobhan: Er, 15."
"Brennan: 15? You are [mimicking explosion] knocked back against the wall. The mirror fills your bedroom with light. You see standing on the other side of the mirror wreathed in light is Titania, Queen of the Faeries."
Siobhan: I kneel.
"Misty: It's been such a long time! Oh my god, you look great."
Titania: [imperious] Silence!
[glass shattering]
Brennan: All the glassware in your bedroom shatters.
"Misty: That's fine, I can get other glassware. [clearing throat] I'm silent, I'm quiet."
Titania: [whispering] My name. My name. You would steal glamor meant for me. You would usurp the glory that was intended for your Queen. Four-hundred years ago you ran away. And just because you hide in a place of iron and smoke does not mean [shouting] you can deny your Queen!
"Brennan: [mimicking explosion] Light goes away. Your clothes rend, and your jewelry falls away for a little bit, and you can feel her trying to rip the shoes off your feet."
Siobhan: Can I cover the mirror back up again?
"Brennan: Yes, make an attack roll to try and cover the mirror."
"Siobhan: Erm, what is that plus?"
Brennan: Dex plus proficiency.
"Siobhan: Uh, 15 plus proficiency is 18."
"Brennan: You grab the silk, hurl it over the mirror. The light fades and you feel one of the bones of your hip break. [sharp cracking]"
"Misty: Damn, this stupid body."
Siobhan: I call Kingston.
"Brennan: Kingston, on your way back to the subway, you get a call from Misty."
Lou: I answer it.
"Misty: Kingston. I've, I've had a bad fall."
Kingston: You fell?
"Misty: I fell. My hip, I think I've broken my hip."
"Kingston: You've broken your— okay. Can you walk? Of course you can't walk. I'm on my way, I'll see you soon."
Misty: Thank you. I'll tell the doorman to let you in.
Kingston: Great.
"Brennan: You rush to Misty's. You arrive there, set the hip in, and probably this is where you're gonna have to crash tonight."
"Kingston: Okay. Can I spend the night, Misty? Is that all right?"
"Misty: Please! Use any one of the guest rooms, it's fine."
Kingston: Okay.
Emily: An apartment with multiple guest rooms!
"Brennan: Kugrash, you head back to the sewers. What does Kugrash do as he heads back to the sewers? Just sleeping?"
"Murph: Uh, yeah, I think he's feelin'... What time is it right now?"
Brennan: It's one o' clock in the morning.
"Murph: Okay, I think he's kinda had a rough day, and he's gonna kinda try to just find a place to think and go to his little hole in the tunnels."
"Brennan: On your way to the little hole, near a subway station, you see a little basket with a bunch of cheese in it. And you see there's a little note on it that says, Wherever you are, Rat Jesus, know that I love you. From Wally."
Emily: I love Wally.
Murph: Kugrash breaks down crying.
Ally: Aww!
"Murph: And then, does Wally live nearby?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Wally lives nearby."
Murph: I wanna go to Wally's house.
"Brennan: You go to Wally's house. You walk in, you see it's late at night. Wally's at his kitchen table, very small little apartment. And you see that he's FaceTiming with his brother. You see he says, he goes,"
"Wally: David, c'mon! We don't know that he's gone. He might still be missing."
"Brennan: You see that the guy on the other end of the phone is a sort of businessman-looking guy, just average, wearing a fleece. He goes,"
[somber piano music]
"David: Wally, it's late, look. Dad's on some fuckin' island somewhere. He's never comin' back, all right? He's gone. He left us."
"Brennan: You see Wally says,"
Wally: I don't think he would do that. I know it's been a long time. I just don't think he would.
"Brennan: He says,"
"David: Look, I gotta go, all right? Take care of yourself, Wally. Come check in anytime."
"Brennan: The little FaceTime thing ends. Wally looks up and you see he says,"
"Wally: Well, least I got the Christmas card."
"Brennan: He puts a little Christmas card up on his fridge from David and David's wife and kids. And it says, “Merry Christmas from the Kugriches.” Wally goes,"
"Wally: [sighs] All right, time to go to bed. Gotta brush my teeth, though."
Brennan: He starts brushing his teeth.
Wally: Okay.
Brennan: Pulls under the blanket.
Ally: Fuck.
"Murph: I think I'm going to, uh… I think Kugrash isn't ready to confront Wally right now, but I wanna give him a good sign. So I do that, like, parent Santa thing. I eat the cheese and I leave it out on a plate. And I just write on a note, “Rat Jesus loves you, and I'm watching you.”"
Emily: I'm watching you!
"Murph: And then I say, “in not a creepy way!”"
"Brennan: Oh, so heartbreaking! And then Kugrash goes and sleeps in the sewers. Pete."
Emily: Kugrash!
Brennan: You enter the Dreaming. What does Pete do once he enters the Dreaming?
"Ally: He'd probably having just some weird dream that's similar to life, but he's probably, like. Making a deal."
"Brennan: You are making a deal. You're in a beautiful neighborhood. You see that there's a cool guy, little handlebar mustache, someone's riding a fixie around. There's cool coffee shops and stuff like that. Selling some drugs. You see that one of the people turns to look at you and says,"
"Man: Oh, hey man, you're Pete the Plug, right?"
Pete: Hmm?
Man: You're Pete the Plug right? Are you gonna hook us up?
"Pete: Yeah, yeah. What do you guys need?"
"Man: Um, well we'd love to get out, I think."
Pete: Totally.
"Man: Do you have anything to help us, like, get out?"
"Pete: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Lemme see."
"Ally: I like, pull out some mushrooms. I'm like,"
"Pete: Into this? You gonna go camping or something, or?"
Man: [whispering] We've always wanted to go to New York. [creepy hissing and clicking] [cracking]
"Brennan: These mandibles extend and start clicking, and you see that all the people around here begin to turn insectoid. They take your mushrooms, start passing them out, and around you, a rip in the Dreaming opens, and you see a neighborhood in New York City. And these things begin to fly out. They become surrounded by the Umbral Arcana, and you see that they are headed into real New York City."
"Man: Thanks, Pete!"
[insectoid slithering and scuttling]
"Pete: Fuck, fuck fuck!"
"Brennan: And they storm in. You snap awake as quick as you can. On the table, it is morning."
Ally: Okay. I find Alejandro.
Brennan: Alejandro's there.
"Alejandro: [gasps] Peter, what did you see?"
"Pete: Okay, uh, okay. I was, I was probably in Williamsburg or something. And these people wanted to get out. And I gave them mushrooms. And then they said thank you, they all turned into insects and ripped a hole and left and got out, and went into an actual place in New York."
Alejandro: You let them out?
"Pete: Yeah, in the dream. I was selling."
"Alejandro: [yelling] Peter, what you do in the dream matters!"
"Pete: I don't know, I was just doing what I'd normally do in the day to day."
Alejandro: What you would normally do is--
Pete: They didn't even give me money.
Alejandro: God!
"Brennan: You see he, boom! Opens up a window. You see that he's doing a Clairvoyance spell onto a neighborhood. You hear screams."
[screaming voices]
"Alejandro: My god, my god. [stammering]"
"Brennan: You see,"
"Alejandro: I, I must run and find Esther. Collect your friends. These people are in danger!"
Pete: Fuck!
Brennan: What's Pete do?
Ally: Sends out a mass text? Do I have your guys’ numbers?
"Brennan: You wake up hungover. You wake up in the Chantry upstairs. You wake up in Misty's apartment. You wake up in the sewers. There's trouble, you see it's right next to the Steinway subway stop, and you guys all know where to go."
Murph: Start running there.
Brennan: You guys rush to the subway stop in very--
"Siobhan: Wait, I can't rush. I've just broken my hip."
"Brennan: Your hip has, Kingston does some—"
Lou: I use magic to heal you.
"Siobhan: All right, all right, all right, all right."
Lou: We are not going to do this in a normal way.
Murph: He’s not a regular doctor.
"Brennan: You guys rush, all get on the subway. Kingston, you give a little bit of help getting that subway there extra quick. And [mimics explosion] you guys rush up out of the subway steps and hear the chittering of strange insects. I'm gonna need everybody here to roll initiative."
Ally: Roll in here?
Brennan: That's all for this week on The Unsleeping City! Tune in next week and see what's bugging our intrepid heroes! [hissing and chittering]
Ally: I hate bugs!

[tense music]
"Brennan: You guys rush up out of the subway. The buildings are covered in horrifying, gross webs. A wasp centaur [growling savagely]. Giant fucking beetle monster."
Becky: I'mma need them all [growls] dead!
"Kugrash: I summon you, my babies. Defend your true king, you pieces of shit!"
Brennan: You hear muffled screams.
Kingston: What the fuck is in there?
Ally: I hate this.
Emily: Those guys are fuckin' going up in flames.
[frenzied screaming]
"Emily: Just try and fucking touch me with 25, bitch!"
[mimicking gunshots]
Becky: When this bug tramples you!

Lou: Nat 20!

[RECAP]
Kugrash: I wasn't always a rat.
Kingston: [gasps] What?
Kugrash: My real name is Bruce.
Alejandro: Nod is the spirit of hope and dreams. Sometimes referred to as the Monarch of the Sixth Borough.
Kingston: What's going on with Lazarus?
"Willy: Emma Lazarus, she wrote the poems described in that woman's book."
"Brennan: You are, phew, knocked back against the wall. [magical shimmering] The mirror fills your bedroom with light. Standing on the other side of the mirror is Titania, Queen of the Faeries."
Siobhan: I kneel.
[chittering]
[cracking]
[dramatic music]
Brennan: All the people around you are beginning to turn insectoid.
Alejandro: You let them out?
"Pete: Yeah, in the dream! I was just selling!"
"Alejandro: [yelling] Peter, what you do in the dream matters!"
Brennan: You guys wash up out of the subway steps and hear the jittering of strange insects.
[jittering]
Ally: I hate bugs.
[END RECAP]
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: All right, you guys ready?"
Murph: Yes.
Lou: Mhm.
Ally: Yeah!
Emily: Yeah!
Zac: Yeah!
"Brennan: Here we go. Hell yeah. Welcome back, one and all, to The Unsleeping City. I am your dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. These are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes."
"Brennan: Last we left off, [tense music] our brave adventurers had been scattered around the city. Some in a lovely penthouse, some at the Clinton Hill chantry, some in the sewers, some all the way in Staten Island in a bar."
"Emily: [points at Brennan] Because of you, you did it to me!"
Ally: That was harsh.
Emily: I had plans.
"Brennan: As you guys rush through the Steinway Street subway entrance, you guys are, by the way, are all the way out in Astoria, Queens. You're rushing up to the subway. You guys can feel, specifically Kugrash, Misty, and Kingston, you guys can feel the Umbral Arcana is rent here. There is nothing keeping people from seeing the horrors of the dream world entering this place, and you see that all of the tears in the Umbral Arcana here are connected as though by strings to their puppet master, Pete. Pete, your body is just pulsating with magic that appears to be keeping this place open, keeping this like—"
Ally: Fuck.
"Brennan: This place opens. As you guys leap up the steps, you guys see that you sort of all congregate here and meet at the same. Perhaps some of Kingston's city magic as the train rushes, you get all off the thing. All of you look well-rested except for Sofia."
"Emily: I've got a CamelBak that I've like, shoved a box wine into."
Lou: Oh my god.
Siobhan: So horrifying.
Emily: So I kinda almost look like a Ghostbuster. [laughing] But with box wine.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You guys rush up out of the subway. You hear muffled screams and chittering. You feel the presence. Insides of the buildings are covered in horrifying, gross webs. [insects buzzing] You look around you and you see a horrifying wasp centaur woman rise up into the air."
"Emily: It doesn't look like Epona, does it?"
"Brennan: No, it does not look like Epona."
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: You see that this woman rises up into the air. You see that she looks at you guys and goes--
"Wasp Centaur: [threatening insect noises] [stereotypical perky white woman voice] Oh my God, what are you guys doing here? Hi, Pete!"
"Pete: Hey, what's your name again?"
Wasp Centaur: Becky.
"Pete: Becky, what's up?"
"Becky: Hey, um, welcome to the neighborhood. Me and my friends are moving in. Thank you so much for, like, helping us out and like, giving us the heads-up. This place is awesome."
"Brennan: You hear, boom, boom, down the street, as you can hear, like-- [slurping] Cocoons being unraveled as these insects spread. [chittering]"
"Misty: I've heard of gentrification, but this is crazy."
"Pete: Oh, god fucking damn it."
"Kugrash: Pete, what are you doin'?"
"Pete: I'm sorry, man, I, uh--"
Sofia: Wanna come clean to us?
"Pete: I invited them here in a dream. I thought I was just selling 'em drugs, fuck, fuck, fuck."
"Brennan: You see that she says,"
"Becky: You don't want us to leave, do you?"
Pete: You're kinda trashing the neighborhood.
"Becky: Um, what are you talking about? These hives are gorgeous. If anything, the property values of rent here are going up."
Pete: No.
Ricky: But you're forcing the community out.
"Becky: We're not forcing them out, we're forcing them in. To cocoons, to eat. [slurping]"
"Sofia: Okay, yeah."
"Pete: Great, there it is, there it is. What are you gonna order, a flat white?"
Becky: The only flat white around here is gonna be you.
Ricky: Stop.
Becky: When this bug tramples you!
[laughing]
"Brennan: You see, she goes, whomp. It appears that Becky is some kind of sorceress force that is anchoring these bug monsters to this realm using Pete's magic. You sort of hear this, see, there's a giant fucking beetle monster down the way. [chittering] With a hard hat on, who goes like,"
"Beetle: Oh, yeah, we can knock these buildings down real easy and make giant mounds. Really beautiful luxury mounds to live in."
Brennan: You see—
Ally: God damn it.
Brennan: Becky is going to act first.
Ally: Of course she is.
Brennan: Let's see what this does here.
"Siobhan: Oh no, that's a big old circle."
[group groaning]
Emily: We should have stayed spread out enough.
Murph: I'd just put out more.
"Emily: We could've only each moved one step, though. There's no way we could have..."
"Zac: It would automatically have started like that, right?"
"Lou: Inevitable, inevitable."
"Brennan: So you see that Becky gets on her phone and says,"
"Becky: Bugs, there's some really fucking weird people here. I'm not sure what they're doing. I'm gonna need them all dead. [chittering]"
[intense music]
"Brennan: And these horrible mandible claws click in her mouth and she belches a colossal cloud [smoke blowing] of the most stinking, acrid, insectoid smoke. [blowing] Just covers the area. You guys are all obscured in it, and Becky disappears from sight. Anyone here can make a Perception check that wants to."
"Lou: I mean, you know I will."
Siobhan: 11.
Lou: 27.
"Ally: 18, no bonus."
Brennan: 27?
Lou: 27.
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Becky, you can hear her flying directly overhead, [buzzing] into this weird burrowed hole."
Kingston: She's behind us in some weird burrowed hole!
"Brennan: That is going to be Kingston's turn. On the beginning of your turn, I'm gonna need a Constitution saving throw."
"Lou: Okay, great."
Ally: Fuck.
"Lou: Uh, 14?"
Brennan: 14 saves.
Emily: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
"Brennan: You, man, see what's happening, holds your breath. You are still within the cloud of noxious smoke."
"Lou: Can I step out of it, or can I move? Is it possible to move out of it?"
"Brennan: You made your save so you don't breathe any smoke. You're unaffected, you can try to get out of it."
"Lou: Great, I'm gonna take 6, right?"
"Brennan: And I can show you the area of it. It's like, right here."
"Lou: Three, four, five, six, so I'm out there."
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: Great, and then I will cast Bless on Pete, Ricky, and Sofie Bikes."
Brennan: You can target more than three people if you use higher spell slots.
"Lou: Yeah, but I only care about three of the... Are you better at Constitution? What's your Con mod?"
"Murph: Uh, 1."
"Brennan: So, you hit Sofia, Ricky, and—"
Lou: I would like to cast Bless as a second-level spell.
Emily: Whoo!
Lou: And I will add Kugrash to the Bless.
Kugrash: Yeah. ‘Preciate it.
Ally: Can you just add one person when you're adding a new spell slot?
"Lou: I could cast it as a third-level spell and add a fifth person, but that's too."
Siobhan: I'm good.
Lou: She's good.
Brennan: Cool.
Kingston: Misty's been around.
Misty: I've been around.
Kingston: This woman can take care of herself.
"Brennan: Wonderful, all right. That's your movement, that's your action. That is Kingston's turn. It is now Pete's turn. Pete, I'm gonna need you to make a Constitution saving throw at the beginning of your turn."
Ally: What do I add to that?
Lou: With Bless.
"Brennan: Uh, your Constitution save is here. I believe it's--"
"Ally: Oh, fun, a 5."
"Brennan: 5, not bad, and you add Bless to it."
Emily: Whoo.
Murph: Sweet.
"Ally: Yeah, there we go. All right, 19 plus 5, 24."
"Brennan: You don't hold your breath, but this doesn't have any effect on you at the moment. It's part of your dream magic. You invited these bugs in."
"Ally: Cool, can I make a Perception check to find out like, can I move? How am I attached to this? Can I try to figure out the workings of-?"
"Brennan: Uh, give me an Arcana check."
"Ally: Okay, yeah, Arcana, I have 1. Damn it, 3."
Brennan: 3.
Ally: Fuck.
"Brennan: You, as Alejandro said earlier, study, get your powers under your control, find a way to do them, and you don't know what it is you can do."
"Ally: Okay, can I try to hop up on here?"
Zac: That's so high.
"Siobhan: Yeah, no way."
"Brennan: That would be a pretty wild Athletics check. You're welcome to make it if you like. It will likely fail, and if it fails, you will stay in the cloud and have to make the save again. Also, as long as you're in the cloud, you can't really see."
"Ally: Right, right, right, okay, cool."
"Emily: I was planning on getting up there anyways, and I have better Athletics."
"Ally: Oh, yeah, 'cause you actually have Athletics."
Emily: And Acrobatics.
"Ally: Okay, um… Let's see, so, is Kingston yelling anything? Like, should I follow you out that way?"
"Lou: I mean, I need to know if there are people inside who are in trouble, so that's my motivation for moving that way. You know, I don't know if you wanna kill bugs, if you wanna chase this woman with me, but you know Pete."
"Ally: I'm following Kingston, yeah. I'll go, can I do like a Dash action and try to catch up with him?"
Brennan: So you have a movement and you take six squares of movement and get out of the stinking cloud. You can take another movement if you want with your action because you have not used your action yet.
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: Now you see this roiling cloud of noxious insect whatever. [smoke blowing]
"Zac: 6 gets you out of the thing, right?"
"Ally: Yeah, I'll do 6 to get out of it and then I'll do--"
Siobhan: Don't you have Dispel Magic?
Ally: I don't.
"Siobhan: As your, um--"
"Ally: Oh yeah, I do, Dispel Magic?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
Ally: I'll do that.
"Brennan: Oh, on the stinking cloud? Hell yeah, hold on one second."
Emily: Ooh.
Murph: Sweet.
Ally: That's a great idea.
Brennan: And do you wanna still move?
"Ally: Uh… Yeah, yeah, I'll be next to Kingston, but still, I cast Dispel Magic on the cloud."
"Siobhan: Man, look at how cool you are."
"Lou: God, look at those coat blues."
Ally: Level three or lower and four and higher on a roll.
"Brennan: Uh, hell yeah, Pete, you raise up your hand. Where do you go to in your head as you're like, asking to try and get rid of this magic?"
"Ally: I think I'm still thinking about that fucking guy who talked about like, the bubbles and my dad. I'm trying to figure out who Robert is, so I'm just kind of like, fuck Robert. [laughing]"
[whooshing]
Brennan: You see that the wind picks up and this smoke is sucked away. Nobody else needs to make saving throws.
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: It's gone, phew. Yes, the magic is gone. I need you to make a Wild Magic check for me, if you could be so kind."
"Ally: Yeah, right."
"Brennan: 1, 2, or 3 does it."
Ally: 18.
"Brennan: 18, cool. Now it's 1, 2, 3, 4."
"Ally: Oh, it keeps going past a long rest?"
"Brennan: Oh, it keeps going past a long rest, yes, absolutely. It builds up."
Ally: Great.
Brennan: That's now going to be Ricky's turn.
Zac: Is there a door over here?
"Siobhan: Yeah, there's one right here."
Emily: There is like a hole right here.
"Brennan: There's a hole over there. The hole is open. Ricky, you can see from the door, the door is there. It is webbed and gunked up, so you could bust through it. There's like an open entrance near Kingston and then there's a gunked up one that's all like, webbed over at the front"
Emily: And Ricky is no stranger to...
"Siobhan: There's also two bugs right here, just so you know."
Zac: Two bugs right up there?
"Siobhan: Yeah, two very gross-looking bugs."
Lou: And then the big old beetle.
Siobhan: And then the big old beetle is right over here.
"Zac: I think we should try to stay together, feels right. I'm gonna use my Channel Divinity to use Sacred Weapon."
"Brennan: Cool, as your action, great."
[shimmering]
"Zac: And then I'm gonna run to follow, I'm gonna see if I can climb up on the roof, too."
"Emily: Yeah, do it."
"Brennan: Cool, it's not built for climbing. Go ahead and give me a DC 15 Athletics check."
"Zac: Okay, cool. Uh, 24."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. It's half movement getting up there, so I'm gonna say that you just get up here onto the corner."
"Zac: Okay, cool. And that's my turn, I guess, yeah."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, Sacred Weapon, you hop up on the roof. That's now going to be, ba-ba-bum, uh, beetle."
"Siobhan: Mm, damn it."
Lou: Don't like that name.
"Brennan: So let's see here. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty."
"Lou: Oh, shit."
"Brennan: You see that the beetle looks at you and says,"
"Beetle: Uh, hey bud, this is a construction zone. I'm gonna have to kill ya."
Brennan: And proceeds to--
"Ally: Hoo, fuck!"
Kugrash: He's not a regular beetle. Regular beetles are pretty friendly. And adorable.
Ricky: I don't think that's how that job works.
"Brennan: If he reaches you, oh boy. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty."
Zac: Really?
"Brennan: twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty. [chittering] He makes it here, 'cause he's--"
Lou: Jesus.
Brennan: [crashing] This enormous beetle's just fucking rushing you.
Siobhan: Gross.
Brennan: That's the beetle's turn. That's now going to be Kugrash.
"Murph: Oh, shit. Umm. Hmm hmm hmm."
Ally: Fuck.
Murph: Ricky's in trouble up there.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, fuck."
"Murph: I'm guessing I don't have any kind of line of sight up here. Okay, here's what I'll do. I am going to use a bonus action to Misty Step up to here. Can I do that, 30 feet?"
"Brennan: Cool, yeah, for sure."
"Murph: Sweet, okay, I Misty Step up here, bam. [magical shimmering] Like a really gross Nightcrawler."
Brennan: A little blast of stinky sewer steam pops up.
"Kugrash: Oh hey, Ricky, we're so fucked."
"Murph: And then that's a bonus action, and then as an action, I'm gonna use my crown's ability and conjure up four rat swarms."
[dramatic royal music]
"Kugrash: I summon you, my babies. Defend your true king and defend the city! You pieces of shit, I love you."
Siobhan: Rats versus bugs!
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: Ugh, New York, honestly."
Siobhan: The greatest city in the world!
Ally: Greatest city in the world.
Brennan: Where are you summoning these bad boys?
Murph: Right around my dude here and I want 'em to attack 'em.
"Rats: To arms! [dramatic music] To arms, my brothers! The Rat King calls and his people shall answer! Let the banners unfurl! Let the clarion trumpets call! A war, a glorious war! Let the war of bugs and rats be determined today!"
"Kugrash: Yeah, we're just killin' some fuckin' bugs, buddy, it's fine."
Rats: Let them sing of this day for eons to come!
"Kugrash: Yeah, I think they're gonna forget about us. All of us, even the Rat King."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, would they, would that spell--"
Murph: I know with Conjure Animals--
Brennan: Do they attack on the turn or no?
"Murph: Summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turn, they obey- okay. So would I need to roll initiative for them?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and roll initiative. Let me know what you get."
"Murph: God damn it, 5. Okay, so they probably go after me, which is kinda good, actually."
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: Wait, did I get skipped? Because like, my initiative is 12."
Emily: Mine is 7.
"Brennan: Oh, and we're at Kugrash already? Misty, yes, I'm sorry, that's gonna be your turn now."
"Siobhan: Okay, great. So, I am going to move over to my pals over here. And then I'm gonna, do I have line of sight for this?"
Brennan: Beetle up there?
Siobhan: Big boy up here.
"Brennan: No, you do not."
"Siobhan: In which case, I… Don't have anything useful to do right now."
Emily: You could buff yourself somehow.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm just gonna turn to Pete and say,"
"Misty: Darling, this hat, it's really working for you. A lot of people couldn't wear a hat like this. It looks great."
[magical shimmering]
Pete: Oh my god.
"Siobhan: And I give you Bardic Inspiration, which is a d8."
"Pete: Yo, thank you."
"Brennan: Wonderful. Kugrash and Misty have gone. Now, it's gonna be our little roach friends. [tense music] These guys close in. [chittering]"
"Siobhan: What were you, Kugrash?"
"Murph: 7, but it just went out of order a little bit."
"Siobhan: Mm, right, because--"
Emily: I'm 7 also though.
Zac: I think we just gotta chase this sorceress down.
Ally: Yeah.
"Zac: I think we gotta get away from this, 'cause she was like--"
"Ally: You guys are pretty close, I think, to her hole."
"Siobhan: Yeah, she has a hole right here. Butthole 2: Electric Boogaloo."
"Zac: I wonder if I could just like, break through the roof."
Emily: Can I use a ki point not on my turn?
"Brennan: I don't think so unless it says you can use it as a reaction. These two are coming for ya, ba-ba-bum. Both roaches miss, they kinda-- [chittering] These are the least human of them. They seem sorta like half-finished and more like dream energy than the other bugs do, and they both go to attack you. And that's the roaches' turn. That's going to be, ba-ba-ba, Sofia, that's you."
"Emily: Okay, I am going to… Let me just decide if this is definitely what I wanna do. Oh wait, what is it? I just have to confirm that I can do one thing. So, can I confirm with you? So, I have my Drunken Technique, which means if I use a Flurry of Blows, I get the benefit of a disengage, which means I get my full action, but it says I think I also get an extra—"
"Brennan: Your full move, yeah."
Emily: Do I get a full movement and it increases by 10 feet?
Brennan: Correct.
"Emily: Okay, so I almost get like a whole extra movement."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: All right, I'm gonna… These guys are too tiny, though. I don't need to Flurry of Blows them. Okay, there's not any kind of, it's kinda like, if I Flurry of Blows one guy and like absolutely wreck him, that's just life, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you're within range of two of them."
Emily: So I could like kinda distribute it between?
"Brennan: You could distribute it, yeah."
"Emily: Okay, I'll do that then. All right, so. Does a 21 and a 26 hit?"
Brennan: Yes.
"Emily: Okay, um, sorry, I need things, d8. So that is 12."
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: 6.
"Brennan: The first one, you absolutely just, bam! Crush this bug under your foot. You guys see that Sofia is fighting not like normal. You're like full tipsy swaying."
Emily: I got my CamelBak hanging out of my mouth.
"Brennan: Just a drip of Franzia, yeah."
Ally: Ugh.
"Brennan: Great, and you injure the other."
"Emily: Okay, well, I still haven't done my Flurry of Blows. Those were my two attacks. Now I'm trying to do."
Brennan: Now you do two.
Emily: Does a 23 hit and does a 17 hit?
Brennan: They both hit.
Emily: So I'm gonna hit him for another 16.
"Brennan: Boom, boom. Yeah, just a flurry of like, you're like balling up your fists but your arms are more like ropes, so you're just like, bah-bah-bah-bah."
Emily: And then I wanna use my disengage from my Step of the Wind and I just wanna book it for this ooze hole.
"Murph: Oh, shit."
Ally: Nice.
Brennan: Hell yeah. So you can move 50 on that disengage.
"Emily: Two, three, four."
Zac: That's great.
"Emily: Five, okay, so I get right up to the mouth of it."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: So I'm knocking in, I'm saying,"
"Sofia: Hello, I'm out here."
[tense music]
Brennan: You see the interior of a very dark bodega inside there.
"Emily: Okay, is there a cat?"
[Ally laughing]
Brennan: Make a Perception check for me.
Siobhan: Cute!
"Emily: Okay, uh, 16."
Brennan: There is. You feel a sensation of a cat somewhere in the bodega.
Emily: I need to save the cat.
"Ally: Hey, I hear that's a great structure for a screenplay."
Murph: Good God.
"Brennan: That's gonna be the swarms, these rat swarms."
"Murph: Oh, yeah. Do I roll for 'em or do you?"
Brennan: You can go ahead and roll for 'em.
"Murph: Sweet. Okay, what are there, four of them? I'll just roll. They only get plus 2 to attack."
"Kugrash: Come on, you little pieces of shit."
"Murph: Oh, God! I rolled an 8, an 8, and a 4. I suck so bad, and a 5! What?"
Siobhan: You want me to roll for the rats?
"Murph: Yes, I do!"
Brennan: The rats are uneffective against the giant real estate beetle.
Emily: They're so righteous but so bad.
Murph: I can't believe that.
Emily: Oh my God.
Murph: I'm the worst fuckin' roller.
Lou: That’s tough. That's to four dice.
"Murph: I might have Siobhan be my designated roller and just be like, Just roll initiative for me, please."
Brennan: I'm going to need Sofia at the door there to make a--
Emily: Okay. Dexterity saving throw?
Brennan: Constitution saving throw.
Emily: Okay.
Lou: You're blessed.
"Emily: Oh, I'm blessed, I forgot to even add that!"
"Murph: Oh wait, no, my rats aren't blessed, it's okay."
"Lou: Oh, your rats aren't blessed."
Emily: This is gonna fuckin' come into serious play.
Lou: I ain't got time to bless all them damn rats.
"Emily: Ooh, oh my god, just try and fuckin' touch me. Just try and fucking touch me with a 25, bitch!"
"Brennan: Um, hell yeah."
Emily: But do I still take half damage?
Brennan: You do still take half damage.
Emily: God damn it.
Brennan: You take… You take 22 points of damage.
[health bar noise]
Lou: That's half damage?
Emily: Halved?
Brennan: That's half damage.
"Zac: Wait, what hit you?"
Ally: Fuck.
[Emily screaming]
Lou: What the fuck is in there?
Emily: What the fuck is in there?
Murph: I can't fight whatever that thing is.
Emily: If anyone wants to come help me.
"Brennan: You see, appearing in the bodega, eyes glowing-"
Emily: Was it the fucking cat?
"Brennan: No, it's Becky, the wasp, who goes—"
"Becky: Hey, um, I don't know, but we try to keep things a little bit quiet in this neighborhood, and you're like, actively drunk out on the street, so maybe you should get out."
"Brennan: [whooshing] And you see that your skin tightens, hardens, [squelching] and dries, and she just--"
"Emily: Ooh, I look good though, right, Botox?"
"Brennan: No, she sucks the water out of your body and you take 22 points of damage."
"Sofia: Honestly, thank you, I'm about to have my period, so I'm carrying some water weight. Thank you, that's good for me."
"Brennan: You see that she, buzz, [buzzing] flies deeper into the hive of buildings."
"Pete: Fuckin' fuck, ugh, gross."
Brennan: That's gonna be Kingston.
"Lou: Okay, I'm gonna run right up to Sofie Bikes and be like,"
"Kingston: Damn, you look good."
"Sofia: Oh my God, thank you."
"Kingston: But not for good reasons,"
Lou: And then Cure Wounds.
[magical shimmering]
Emily: Does all my water weight come back?
"Ally: And I'm like,"
"Pete: Honestly, healthy, ey."
"Lou: This is a d8, right? This is what a d8 looks like, great. Oh, 2 plus spellcasting ability."
Brennan: 5.
"Lou: 5, so 9, is that it?"
Brennan: 7.
"Lou: Uh, 7, there you go."
Emily: Thank you.
[health bar whirring]
"Lou: It's not enough, but it's a start."
"Emily: Yeah, but it takes me from half my hit points to..."
"Ally: Yeah, fuck."
"Lou: Yeah, and I guess, is there any way I can peer into, can I like, get a look at what this area looks like?"
"Brennan: Yeah, it looks like a webbed-up bodega. [insects chittering] You hear some chittering from inside it, but you could move into it."
Ally: Let's get in there.
"Lou: Uh, I'll take a step in, I'll take a step in, yeah."
[ominous music]
"Brennan: Ooh, doctor."
Emily: Where's the cat?
"Ally: Oh, what are those? Oh, those are people from my dream, fuck."
Emily: What's this blob?
Lou: Do I have to walk in?
"Emily: Oh, it's a cocoon, I bet. I bet this is a cocoon."
"Ally: I hate this. Oh, that dude's fucked."
"Siobhan: Oh, this poor deli owner."
Lou: Is that a real person?
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
Siobhan: He came to this country to have a better life.
Emily: Is this a person in a cocoon?
Brennan: It's something in a cocoon.
Emily: Okay. That is where I'm gonna go next.
Siobhan: Oh no.
Ally: Here we go.
Zac: I gotta get that sorceress.
"Brennan: Cool, Kingston, go ahead and make your movement into the place. I actually can't see from here. Are there any bugs in this little row?"
"Siobhan: No, no."
"Brennan: Cool, Kingston, go ahead and take your movement."
"Lou: Okay, great, I'll come in--"
"Brennan: You're gonna lose five feet of movement going through the hole, just so you know."
"Lou: Okay, so if I start, I don't know, one..."
"Brennan: Two, three."
"Lou: Two, three, four, five, six."
"Brennan: You're not gonna be able to get around the other side. That's a wall back here, so if you wanna go--"
"Lou: That's fine, I'm just trying to put as much distance between me and everything else as I possibly can."
"Brennan: Okay, so you're not trying to go around the corner. You're like, moving back into the bodega for a second."
"Lou: Just back, yeah, exactly."
"Brennan: Gotcha, cool, cool, cool. Awesome, you move in, you cast your Cure Wounds. That's Kingston's turn. Pete, that's you."
"Ally: Okay, great. Okay, I go in."
Brennan: Go ahead and take your six squares of movement. If someone else wants to get Pete that's closer to that hole.
"Siobhan: Let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six. So, you're basically just in the hole."
Brennan: Just inside.
"Ally: All right, great. Can I, uh… Okay, I'm gonna cast, I'm gonna use a sorcery point to do a Careful Spell."
"Brennan: Awesome, yep."
Ally: And I'm gonna exclude the five people from our campaign. Do they have to be in eyesight to exclude them in Careful?
"Brennan: Um, no, I think you can actually pick them. If you know their name, that's a way to do it, yeah."
"Ally: Great, I'm gonna do that and then I'm gonna cast Fireball on this bodega."
Murph: Ooh!
"Siobhan: Fuck, man."
"Emily: Ooh, yeah, man. Setting it on fire."
Murph: Fucking epic.
"Emily: Wait, hey, what about the people in cocoons? Can you Careful Spell them?"
Ally: I can only Careful Spell up to five people.
"Brennan: Well, here's the thing. Fireball, I don't believe can go through solid objects. So walls and ceilings, it can't go through, so you don't need to actually worry about Misty or Ricky or Kugrash or other people like that if you don't want to."
"Murph: Yeah, we're up on the roof and these guys are outside."
"Zac: So, exclude us."
"Brennan: So, take this, put it where you want to put it, and then if anyone's inside it, go ahead, in that red."
"Ally: It's so fun, it's huge."
"Brennan: It's enormous. You're a monster, you're a nightmare. Go ahead and yeah, put it where you want to put it, and then anyone who's within it, you can make your call to exclude them or not."
"Murph: It's just the deli owner, right? If you try to hit these guys."
"Ally: Yep, that's it, all right, cool. So then I'll exclude Kugrash."
"Zac: You could just do that, right?"
"Murph: Yeah, we're up here."
"Zac: You could almost not have to use it, right?"
"Emily: Yeah, I think--"
Ally: What do you mean?
Siobhan: There's just the deli owner.
Emily: You might not need to use Careful.
Brennan: You will have to do it to save the deli owner.
"Ally: I'll do it to save the deli owner and us, 'cause then we can run through it and not have to, we can try to get to that other pod."
Emily: Right.
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Oh, if there's a fire."
"Brennan: Oh, and if you want to pick other people, they won't have to worry about running through the flames in other words, gotcha."
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, so I put everyone in the campaign but Kugrash, and I use that exclude for the deli owner."
"Siobhan: And Ricky probably, right? Because he's on the roof."
"Brennan: Cool, you burn your sorcery point."
Ally: But I include Ricky so he can run in later.
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and roll 5d6 damage."
Murph: Yeah.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Murph: You need more?
"Ally: Please, oh, it's 8d6."
Brennan: Fireball?
Ally: Is what mine says.
Brennan: Fireball's 8d6?
Ally: Let me find it.
Brennan: Hold on one second.
Lou: We about to get--
Murph: 8d6 fire damage on a failed Dex save.
Brennan: Jesus!
Ally: And it's half on a pass.
"Brennan: 5E, you crazy."
Ally: Thank you.
"Brennan: Cool, 8d6."
"Ally: I just need one more. Oh, can I use two of yours?"
"Murph: Uh, I got three for ya."
"Ally: Oh, thank you."
"Brennan: And there's what, two roaches in there?"
"Ally: Yeah, two pincer guys."
"Brennan: Two little pincer guys, oh no--"
Ally: And then one tiny roach.
"Brennan: Oh, the two bugsters over there, gotcha."
Siobhan: Bugsters?
Ally: Like hipster bugs?
"Brennan: Hipster bugs, yeah."
Siobhan: You fucker.
"Ally: Alright, cool. 8d6, did they— Oh, we don’t know if they passed their Constitution yet?"
"Brennan: We don't know yet, just go ahead and roll. Tell me how—"
"Ally: Bitch! Uh, all right."
"Siobhan: Oh my God, so much math."
"Ally: 10, that's, uh, 19, 25 damage."
Brennan: 25 damage.
Emily: Ooh!
Zac: Each?
Siobhan: Each.
"Brennan: To each of them. Hold on one second, I'm gonna roll their save."
"Murph: Oh, wow."
"Zac: Oh, wow, yeah."
Murph: Ew.
"Ally: Thanks, friends."
Siobhan: You're very welcome.
Emily: Those guys are fuckin' going up in flames.
"Brennan: 25, Jesus."
"Emily: Fuckin' eat sulfur, bitches."
Siobhan: Eat my grits.
Brennan: So you see that they're talking to each other.
"Sofia: So we can go through the fire, right?"
"Brennan: So you see that they're near the cocooned deli guy, who's like--"
[muffled screaming]
"Brennan: And you see that one of the bugsters who has like, a handlebar mustache, some big antennas, holding a big coffee cup, and he's like,"
"Bugster: Really, what I think would be cool would be to put a cafe in here, but more like a WeWork space. Oh, hey, Pete, how's it goin', bud?"
[fire exploding]
[screaming]
[fire crackling]
"Brennan: You see that the deli owner screams, he goes,"
Deli Owner: Ah!
"Brennan: And you burn the webs on him, but he's totally unharmed, so he's like—"
"The deli owner screams manically, but starts to decrease in volume as he realizes he’s not hurt, crying instead."
Emily: That's so cool to have been in fire but not be hurt.
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: You gave him a great story.
Zac: The unburnt. Deli owner.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: You see he looks around at his now burning bodega and he goes,"
"Deli Owner: [screaming, slight accent] Ah, okay, maybe the insurance will cover some of this damage."
Brennan: The two bugsters turn to you and go—
[chittering]
"Brennan: Smoking but not dead, and say—"
Ally: Fuck. 25?
"Bugsters: Ugh, wow, okay. I feel a lot of aggression and I guess we're gonna have to deal with this."
Brennan: That is Pete.
"Ally: There's this little swarm of bugs on the ground, and then there's a roach."
"Brennan: Oh, the swarm is fucking gone. You guys wanna hand--"
Ally: And the roach is gone too?
Brennan: The roach is also fully gone.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: So the little roach, fully gone. The little swarm, fully gone."
Murph: Ew.
"Ally: Cool, fuck."
Siobhan: It was a cool spell.
Zac: That was...
Murph: That was great.
Zac: Rad.
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: I actually am going to, just 'cause of where this is at, and here we go. We got one, this person's gonna rush through here. And where's the other one?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, you got it."
Brennan: This bugster jumps up onto the rack above.
Ally: Gross.
"Brennan: Above Pete up here, and they're gonna take some swings, baby. Um, ba- ba-bum. Uh, okay. Ooh, Pete, you lucky boy."
[health bare whirring]
"Brennan: Pete, you take 14 points of damage. These bugsters start going-- [growling] You know, with these huge like, sort of praying mantis mandibles overhead, and then you see they go like,"
"Bugsters: I don't get what your deal is, man. We're just trying to create a fun community space here in the bodega."
Ally: Fuck.
Brennan: That's their turn. That's now going to be Misty.
"Siobhan: Well, I'm gonna get in there. Get in the mix, why not?"
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally sighs, and looks up at Brennan, about to say something."
"Brennan: And I'm gonna need your Wild Magic roll as well, yep."
"Siobhan: Oh no, it's one, two, three, four?"
"Ally rolls, then looks up, silently."
Murph: That's a four.
[tense music]
"Brennan: Wild Magic Surge, hurray!"
"Ally: Oh, fuck."
Brennan: Hold on.
Lou: I'm much too close to Pete.
"Ally: Oh, fuck."
Brennan: You see that you start floating. [whooshing] You are just floating up. You have become perfectly weightless.
"Ally: That's fine, that's fine. No one died."
"Brennan: No one died. Yeah, you begin to float above the ground, up near the top of the bodega. So you're just like, hovering above the hole now. You are totally weightless, like swimming. Like, the dream realm has fully merged with this section of New York."
"Ally: Cool, does Wild Magic Surge restart now that I've hit it?"
Brennan: Now it resets back to one.
"Ally: Okay, thank God."
"Brennan: Um, dope."
[whistling]
"Ally: Sorry, guys."
"Brennan: Yes, now that's going to be Misty."
"Siobhan: Okay, I'm gonna get in here and then I'm gonna cast, oops, sorry. So these guys don't look particularly fucked up."
"Brennan: Actually, the two bugsters look pretty fucked up. They are badly burnt."
"Siobhan: All right, well, regardless of that, I'm gonna cast Crown of Madness on this little. I'll cast Crown of Madness on this dude up here."
"Brennan: Rad, awesome, let me know what save that is."
Siobhan: It is a Wisdom saving throw.
"Brennan: Okay, rad. You cast it. You see that the bugster goes—"
[growling]
[magical shimmering]
Brennan: And chitters madly and resists the spell.
Siobhan: Dang.
"Brennan: He goes, he says,"
"Bugster: Um, okay. Listen, I don't know why you have to come into a fun community space and try to harsh everyone's buzz."
Zac: Ooh.
"Brennan: So, Misty moves, that's your action. Now, that's gonna be Ricky."
"Zac: Okay, I am… I wanna look at that like, vent on the ceiling and see if I can break it open and jump down into it."
Brennan: Rad.
Zac: That one right there next to--
"Brennan: Um, yes, you can either try to make an attack to like, hack through it, or you can make an Athletics check to try to bust through it."
"Zac: I guess I'll attack it, just because I have two attacks, right? Does that make sense?"
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Cool.
"Zac: All right, so I'll just--"
"Ally: Oh yeah, you have that axe or whatever."
Zac: Yeah.
"Ally: Yeah, cool."
"Zac: Oof, a 2 and a 1."
Ally: You're blessed.
Lou: You're blessed.
Emily: You're blessed.
Murph: A 2 and a 1.
Zac: And then I add what?
Emily: So add the d4.
"Lou: D4, Bless."
Emily: D4.
"Zac: So 4 to the 2. I mean, okay, so it's an eight."
Brennan: The AC you're trying to hit is 16 for this metal panel.
Emily: Plus 4 plus 2 now.
Zac: I don't think I—
Siobhan: You wanna use a Luck point?
"Zac: Oh yeah, can I use a Luck?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can use a Luck to reroll this. But wait, do you have Sacred Weapon active right now as well?"
Zac: Yes.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: So that would be plus one, so that would still be 15."
"Brennan: 15, cool, so you can use a Lucky point now if you want."
"Zac: All right. Okay, that one hit."
"Emily: Oh, okay, hah."
Brennan: This thing has 12 hit points. You gotta do 12 damage on this attack roll.
Zac: 1d8 plus 7.
Murph: Do it.
"Lou: Let's go, Ricky, come on."
"Siobhan: Yeah, come on, Ricky."
Zac: Which one's my d8?
"Sofia: Come on, Mr. March."
"Zac: Yeah, I hit it for 14."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: For 14, hell yeah. So yeah, Ricky runs over, what does he do?"
"Zac: I would love to break it open, just like a slash. Like, I've seen one of these, and slash it open, grab Kugrash, and jump down."
"Ally: Aw, cute."
"Murph: Oh, nice."
Emily: So cute!
"Brennan: Hell yeah. So, it's like this—"
"Ally: Oh, isn't this sweet?"
Emily: I hope that Kugrash kinda squirms and doesn't want to come.
"Brennan: So, our boy--"
Zac: I smell smoke and then--
"Brennan: Our boy, yeah, you smell smoke, fire! Our boy, the firefighter paladin of New York, gleams with civic light and raises the axe aloft. [grunts] Hack the vent open, grab Kugrash, as this beetle is like-- [crashing] And just as it's about to like, weigh down on you, you--"
[grunting]
"Ally: Oh, wait!"
Brennan: Yes?
Ally: I can communicate a Mindlink with someone if they're willing. Do you think he would be willing?
"Brennan: Probably, yeah."
"Ally: Before he jumps down, can I remind him that I didn't save Kugrash from the fire that's below you? I only saved you. I had to sub out Kugrash."
"Zac: I mean, is it like fully burning?"
Brennan: It's not gonna be as bad as the damage from the spell. It'll be a smaller amount of fire damage from the ambient burning.
Ally: Can Kugrash take that?
Zac: I can heal.
Siobhan: Throw him.
Ally: We're having this convo.
Siobhan: Jump down there and then throw him.
Zac: I could just Cure Wounds on Kugrash.
"Brennan: You, boom! You and Kugrash are off the roof."
Emily: Can you throw Kugrash mid-air?
"Brennan: If you guys want to go ahead and land, give me just an Athletics check real quick to land safely with Kugrash."
"Zac: Uh, 19."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: Okay, cool, cool, cool."
Brennan: You are solid gold. Incredible feat of superheroics from Ricky Matsui. Rad as hell. That's now going to be--
"Zac: And is it dark in there? 'Cause when I use Sacred Weapon, I think my axe shines or whatever."
Brennan: It is dark no longer.
[holy shimmering]
"Brennan: The bodega is illuminated by your glowing axe. You hear above you, boom, boom, boom! You see that the beetle is trying to jam its body [metal creaking] through the opening of the vent."
Zac: Do your thing.
Brennan: I'm gonna roll to see--
Murph: Can the rats get opportunity attacks? There's four swarms of rats.
"Brennan: Ooh, that's right. Yes, they absolutely can get opportunity attacks."
"Ally: Here we go, Siobhan."
"Emily: Oh yeah, oh yeah."
"Murph: Oh, yes, please roll, yes. One more d20."
Emily: Designated.
"Murph: One more d20, here we go."
Lou: Four nat 20s.
"Siobhan: Jesus Christ, just my dice hit. I got an 11, the rest of them are 6, 5, and 4."
"Murph: So 13, Jesus."
"Brennan: So 13, 13 hits, roll damage."
"Murph: Oh, good."
Siobhan: Maybe it's your dice.
Emily: Maybe your dice are cursed. We need to do a moon ritual and bath them in salt.
"Murph: Uh, 5 damage?"
Zac: Can we pause for a moon ritual?
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: We need a quick salt bath for the dice.
Ally: Are you blessed?
Murph: Not the rats.
Lou: I didn't bless those damn rats.
"Emily: Yeah, what if you had done that?"
"Ally: Come on, Kingston, use a higher level spell slot."
Emily: Use a third-level spell slot so you can—
"Brennan: The beetle is going to attempt to ram through and get to the bodega, unsuccessfully."
Ally: Okay.
[crashing]
"Beetle: Guys, you can't be in the bodega right now! It's under renovation. I'm gonna eat ya."
"Brennan: You see, that's going to be Kugrash."
Murph: Sweet.
"Zac: Oh, for a bonus action, can I cast Shield of Faith on Kugrash?"
[holy shimmering]
"Murph: Oh, thanks, man."
"Brennan: Oh, hell yeah."
Murph: Plus two.
Zac: Plus two AC.
"Murph: Okay, I'm at 19, all right."
"Brennan: Kugrash, give me a Dexterity saving throw, by the way."
"Murph: Oh, boy."
"Emily: Can we say that that manifests as Kugrash's hair is like, really static-electric?"
Brennan: You take 6 points of fire damage.
[health bar whirring]
Murph: Good.
Zac: You good?
Lou: Thank you.
"Brennan: Cool, that's going to be, yeah, Kugrash, that's your turn."
"Murph: Sweet. I guess I'm gonna see, oh, it's probably such a, okay. So we got two guys back here. I should probably fight them as opposed to..."
Ally: We wanna find out what that--
Emily: I'm going after that.
"Siobhan: Yeah, maybe there's another hole."
"Murph: There's another hole right here, too."
Ally: We need you to fight.
"Emily: Yeah, there's a hole through there."
"Murph: All right, I'm gonna peek in the hole. I'm only like, five feet away from this hole."
"Ally: No, remember, she got 20 damage when she was close to the hole."
Emily: Yah.
"Ally: Just like, immediately."
Siobhan: And that was half damage.
Emily: That was half damage.
"Murph: Okay, in that case, I'm gonna create a Flaming Sphere and send it through the hole."
[clapping]
Siobhan: Sick.
Brennan: Hell yeah! How about it?
Ricky: Just be careful.
"Kugrash: Ah, it's fine."
Emily: Ricky's gonna supervise.
"Brennan: You, boom, create a Flaming Sphere."
Siobhan: Cool!
Brennan: And send it through the hole.
"Murph: This, I'm on this side, so this hole."
Ally: It's a Himalayan salt lamp.
"Brennan: Cool, that hole right there?"
Murph: Yeah.
[flames crackling]
Brennan: You hear some screaming and chittering through there. Let me take a little peak real quick.
[whistling]
"Brennan: Yeah, actually, go ahead and roll damage."
Murph: Sweet.
"Brennan: Or, does it happen on their turn?"
"Murph: It happens if it bumps into one person. They take the damage, and at the end of their turn, if they're in the space, they take damage."
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and roll damage."
"Ally: Yeah, nice, you can do it."
Murph: 5.
"Brennan: Yeah, you hear a screaming, chittering little thing."
"Murph: Sweet, all right, they make a Dexterity saving throw."
Ally: I haven't given this [the plastic Fireball range indicator] back yet because it's so bad-ass.
Emily: It is.
Zac: Can you? [pretends to raise it to his face]
"Emily: Yeah, I was gonna say, keep it over your face."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, Kugrash, that's great."
Emily: That's like your saint picture.
Ally: Yeah. [puts the sphere behind their head like a halo]
Brennan: Are you doing anything else or no?
"Murph: Uh, ba-ba-ba, nope, that's action and bonus action."
Zac: It looked like a stained glass window.
Ally: Yeah.
"Emily: Wow, I would definitely pray to that window."
"Brennan: There's no roaches out over here, are there?"
Siobhan: No.
[insects buzzing]
Siobhan: I killed them all.
Brennan: These two guys drop down here through the vent and are going to attack Ricky.
Zac: Bring it on.
Brennan: Both miss.
"Emily: Cowards, fools."
Brennan: That's gonna be Sofia.
"Emily: Okay, first off, I'm gonna go through this, but I'm gonna roll a Dexterity saving throw because I'm an Acrobat, so, if I just get a DC 15, which I did, I won't have to, it's not difficult terrain."
"Brennan: Cool, awesome."
"Emily: So what I wanna do is I wanna jump through these shelves. I wanna kick through the shelves, like swing on the top of the shelf and put my little body through to get to this thing."
"Brennan: Awesome, I will let you consider the shelves as much as being a wall, which is sort of what they are. If you want to consider them difficult terrain, you gotta give me a DC 20 acrobatics check"
"Emily: DC 20 Acrobatics, okay. I'm blessed too, right?"
Brennan: You are blessed.
"Emily: Ooh, I want this bad."
Zac: Yeah.
"Emily: Okay, 15, I got it!"
[dramatic music]
Murph: Yeah!
"Brennan: You guys see, yeah, you fuckin' parkour. You slide through the webs, and you go through the swinging pincers of that mantis, boom, land on the other side of the shelves, with some--"
"Emily: And then, can I, oh, sorry, what was that?"
"Brennan: Yeah, with some movement to spare, so you get--"
"Emily: Yeah, I still got an action and stuff. I want to do a quick Perception check on this thing. Does it seem like a cocoon that's gonna like, hatch a swarm of bugs?"
"Brennan: You listen. Give me a Perception or an Insight, either one."
Emily: Perception.
Zac: Can you do it blessed?
Emily: That's gonna be 25. I can make it more if you need. I haven't even blessed myself yet.
"Lou: Brennan, just ask, just ask."
"Murph: Brennan, just ask."
"Brennan: You listen to the cocoon as you land, phew, and you hear--"
[purring]
"Emily: You motherfuckers, I fuckin' go to town on that thing, both attacks."
"Siobhan: No, that's a cat!"
"Brennan: No, no, the cocoon!"
Emily: Wait.
Siobhan: Oh.
"Emily: Oh, wait, can I attack it in a way that--"
Brennan: You can try to rip.
Emily: Can I rip the cocoon off?
"Brennan: Yes, you absolutely can."
"Emily: Okay, so—"
Ally: It sounded like bugs.
"Emily: Yeah, I guess I thought, oh my God."
"Brennan: No, you hear a soft breathing of some kind."
"Emily: Oh my God, ha! Okay, wait, I already did it. I had gotten two 9, so do 17, or what am I rolling here? Am I attacking to rip it off? I'm so nervous right now."
"Brennan: I'm sorry, you are attacking to rip, I assume you're attacking to rip the cocoon off."
"Emily: Yeah, okay."
"Brennan: Go for it, yeah."
"Emily: So I had gotten, I got a 9 plus 8 plus 2, so 20. I did that wrong, but, and then--"
Ally: 19.
Emily: And then a 22.
"Brennan: Those both hit, yeah."
"Emily: Okay, and then I'm doing damage to the cocoon?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you're trying to deal--"
"Emily: To make it clear, I'm not hurting the cat."
Ally: Are you hurting the cat?
Brennan: No. You're trying to deal 15 points of damage.
Lou: It sounds like she's hurting the cat.
"Emily: Oh, well, that's..."
Zac: Emily just hates that cat.
"Emily: Okay, so that's gonna be 9 and then 6."
Zac: That's 15.
"Emily: Oh, okay."
"Brennan: Oh, you did it. So you see that you, hah, land over the thing, hear this purring, and I think, once again, probably go for the hairdresser two holes."
"Emily: Yeah, I definitely do."
"Brennan: Snip, snip, snip, snip, snip."
[whooshing]
[shimmering]
"Brennan: Light disappears, the fire goes out."
[whooshing]
Brennan: The axe glows brighter.
[mystical music]
Brennan: Stars appear all over the bodega.
[whooshing]
"Brennan: For a moment, space and time are suspended."
[gasping]
"Brennan: You see endless stars swirling in a cosmic bodega. All of the snacks and cakes and boxes of cereals and ramens and ice creams are suddenly replaced on the shelves with glittering treasures. Swords, shining helms, coins, far- off potions and tinctures. This bodega is a bodega of wonders."
"Sofia: I think I cast a spell, guys!"
Misty: I don't think it was you!
"Brennan: Appearing before you, with one green eye and one blue, is the most beautiful brindled cat."
[Emily screaming]
"Brennan: Its smile Cheshire Cats out, and you see, it goes--"
[deep purring]
La Gran Gata: [very deep voice] Sofia. Yo soy La Gran Gata de la tienda esquina.
Sofia: Me gusta mucho.
La Gran Gata: Te amo.
"Sofia: Quiero, queiro.."
Ally: Are you gonna fuck that cat?
"Siobhan: Look, she's going through her period."
"Ally: All right, all right."
"Sofia: Amigo, amigos."
"Brennan: He says,"
"La Gran Gata: [Spanish accent] My daughter, mija. It is a very good try, I appreciate. You have released me from my prison. Your friends… [excited] oh, a rat."
Kugrash: No.
"Brennan: He goes,"
"La Gran Gata: You have done a great service, and I shall see it repaid. I guard these stores with might and magic. Let us see you repaid for this service you have done me."
[whooshing]
[meowing]
"La Gran Gata: Also, if you want to help yourself to some Ben & Jerry's, it's in the back."
"Sofia: I will take that, and I have one tiny request, and I am so sorry if it disrespectful. Can I please pet you?"
La Gran Gata: You will do this?
"Sofia: Yeah, behind the ears, anywhere you like it. Chinny rubs, I give him chinny rubs."
[purring and moaning]
La Gran Gata: These are the finest chinny rubs ever I have felt.
Sofia: Thank you.
La Gran Gata: You...
Sofia: I was thinking of becoming a masseuse at one point.
Ally: She's good.
"La Gran Gata: Do you know this? I know you are new to this Unsleeping City. Great deeds are being done. You, as well, have a role to play in deeds to come."
[whooshing]
[gasping]
"Brennan: The cat, boom, vanishes. Your movement increases by an additional 10 for the rest of the fight. And you see that this cat becomes a whirling torrent of stars, and says,"
[wind chimes shimmering]
La Gran Gata: I will need these vermin to vacate my bodega at once.
"Brennan: And she, phew, turns into stars and begins to befuddle as a, like, swirling thing of stars. Both of the bugsters still in the bodega."
[whooshing]
Zac: What about those roaches?
"Brennan: Oh, the roaches as well."
"Zac: Oh, okay."
Brennan: You guys within the bodega see that all of these insects are being bamboozled by La Gran Gata.
Emily: Oh my God.
"Sofia: Guys, I think I might be magic after all."
"Brennan: Hell yes, Sofia."
"Misty: Keep trying, Sofia."
"Brennan: That's gonna be your guy's rat swarms, up on the roof."
"Murph: Sweet, I want them to keep attacking these stupid big bugs. I'm gonna hit this time."
Siobhan and Murph: Yes!
Ally: Yeah!
"Murph: 15 and 21 for two of 'em. Uh, and 20 for another one."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, those are hits."
"Murph: The other guys are all misses, sweet. They actually, okay 14 damage."
Brennan: Hell yes.
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: You hear that beetle being like,"
"Beetle: All right, guys, we gotta knock it off."
"Rats: To arms, to arms, my brothers! Let them sing of this day for ages to come! The day where we banded together, rats and rats alike!"
"Kugrash: Yeah, that's right, kill the bug!"
"Brennan: I'm going to need everybody here, uh, is Ricky and Kugrash there? So this is gonna hit Ricky, Kugrash, and Pete, but not Sofia or Misty. I'm gonna need you guys all to make Constitution saving throws."
Ally: Is that blessed also?
"Lou: Oh, yes."
"Murph: Oh, yes, thank goodness."
"Lou: All of you stay blessed, stay blessed."
Ally: 17.
"Murph: Yes, fuckin' 24."
Zac: 17 as well.
"Brennan: Cool, what'd you get?"
"Lou: Oh, am I in it?"
"Ally: No, no, no, he's further."
"Brennan: Just you three. Okay, you guys all make it. All of you guys take 8 points of damage as you hear Becky go,"
"Becky: Um, guys, could somebody go talk to them?"
"Brennan: [buzzing] And the bodega fills with just tons of swarming regular- sized locusts and biting, stinging things. [health bars noise] You guys are just surrounded by these biting, stinging insects."
Ally: Fuck.
"Brennan: That, there's just like plague of swarming things here."
"Zac: How much damage was that again, sorry?"
Brennan: 8.
Ally: I'm down to 13.
"Brennan: That's going to be Kingston, that's you."
"Lou: I can't touch Pete, right? 'Cause he's all the way up there?"
Siobhan: And you'd have to go into the swarm.
"Brennan: No, actually, you could probably reach in and grab Pete's foot."
Lou: Okay.
"Siobhan: All right, is the swarm still there or is it gone?"
Brennan: Swarm is still there.
Lou: So would I have to enter the swarm?
Brennan: You would probably have to enter the swarm.
"Lou: Great, that's great."
"Ally: Ah, it's okay, it's okay."
"Lou: I'll get you in a second. Can I Command the, is that bug, like, sticking its head through the vent, trying to get down still?"
"Brennan: It's up there, you can see it, yeah."
Lou: Can I Command it?
Brennan: Sure.
"Lou: Yeah, I'd like to Command it to,"
"Kingston: Halt and stay up there, you damn bug."
"Brennan: Awesome. It's gonna make a save. You see that it looks at you and goes,"
Bug: Huh?
"Kingston: Stay up there, you damn bug, stay."
"Bug: Are you from like, a zoning board or a neighborhood council?"
"Kingston: One or the other, yes!"
"Bug: All right, guys, we're gonna have to do some paperwork. We gotta, let's wrap it up, huh! We gotta kill these guys later."
"Brennan: You see it turns around and sort of stomps away from the vent. Cool, so you cast Command, but you do enter the space, so I'm gonna need that Constitution saving throw."
"Lou: Okay. Uh, 19."
Ally: Nice.
"Brennan: Cool, you take 15, 9, you take 12 points of damage."
[health bar whirring]
Lou: Great.
Ally: Fuck.
"Brennan: Uh, ba-ba-bum, cool. So that's your action, that's your, go ahead and move your character wherever your character is."
"Lou: Okay, I had a question about moving. Could I attempt to do an old man version of what Sofie Bikes did and like, scramble through the aisle thing?"
Ally: The bottom one?
Emily: Like maybe the section where I kicked through?
"Lou: Yeah, I'd take the safe DC."
"Brennan: Cool, it's a DC 20 Acrobatics, right?"
"Lou: Okay, great."
"Brennan: Yeah, give me a DC 20 Acrobatics check."
"Murph: Oh, Kingston."
Ally: What do you have on Acrobatics?
Emily: You have plus 1.
Lou: I have plus 1.
Murph: You have to roll a 19.
Lou: Nat 20.
"Brennan stares at him, jaw dropped."
[group cheering]
Lou: [standing up out of his seat] Come on!
Ally: Oh my god.
"Lou: I could feel, I truly, I have never been more confident rolling a dice in my entire life."
Emily: It was in your fingers. You just needed to get it out.
Lou: Yeah.
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: You walk into this bodega and the swirling stars around here. You see that it materializes in the stars. You see the face of La Gran Gata appear for a moment, and you see that the cat looks at you. The bodega cat of all bodega cats. He goes,"
"La Gran Gata: Kingston Brown, from Uptown."
"Kingston: Oh, La Gran Gata, oh, nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you."
"Brennan: You see that as you move, the cat, this beautiful ancient cat spirit, bows and you see echoes of like, cultures across time, Ancient Egypt, all the places that cats have been worshiped and the shelves, you don't have to jump at all. The shelves, boom, slide, and you walk calmly through the open place. You can go wherever you want in that bodega."
"Lou: Okay, great, I'll just go stand next to Sofie Bikes."
Brennan: Incredible.
Lou: Gosh. Wild.
"Brennan: Rock and roll. That's fucking wild. Pete, that's you."
"Ally: I'm still floating, right?"
Brennan: Yes.
"Ally: Cool, so that does mean I can just more easily float towards the next webbed hole?"
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Ally: Cool, cool, I go there."
Lou: Just leaving these dudes.
Ally: Yeah.
Siobhan: You can just fuckin' leave 'em.
"Ally: Because they're pre-occupied, right? With like, the stars or whatever? I don't have to like, take a disengage?"
"Brennan: Yeah, well, they might get an attack on you. You're not sure, but yes."
"Zac: You have 13 health, is that what you said?"
Ally: Yeah.
"Siobhan: I have, if you… I mean, you can get to him or get to me. We both have Cure Wounds."
"Lou: If you can get to me, yeah."
"Ally: Hm, it just feels like we have so much more to go through."
Siobhan: I know.
"Ally: It's like we gotta, um, I do have a shield if someone attacks me, so I guess that's like..."
Brennan: Do whatever you wanna do.
Murph: You could disengage and just poke your head.
"Ally: Yeah, I wanna cast something into there."
"Murph: Yeah, that's true."
"Zac: Just knowing what's in there will be really helpful, if you can get--"
"Ally: Okay, yeah, whatever, I'll just go. I'll take the attack of opportunity."
"Brennan: Okay, you see that they are swinging with what appears to be like disadvantage because of this crazy cat magic."
"Ally: Cool, cool, cool."
"Brennan: That was a clutch move, Sofia."
Ally: Yeah!
"Emily: I thought maybe I would get a familiar out of it, but that's fine."
Ally: You don't know yet.
Lou: You just find a cat.
Murph: Always needs a familiar.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, first one misses with the reaction, second one misses with reaction."
"Ally: Yes, all right, cool."
Emily: Whoo!
Ally: I poke my head in there and I cast Fear.
"Brennan: Ooh, fuck!"
[tense music]
"Brennan: Let's see here, whoosh."
"Murph: And my fireball is here, right, on this bug?"
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, the fireball."
"Brennan: Yes, exactly. Also who's here is Becky."
Siobhan: Becky with the bad bug.
"Brennan: She's like over this person on top of the laundromat stuff. So you go into this next hole into the laundromat. Let me see here, so you're here, so it's five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty. You're gonna have to take a double move to kinda get in there."
Ally: And I won't be able to cast Fear?
Brennan: Or you can just cast Fear through the hole here.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, I would love to do that, like a cone facing that way, because this guy has the fireball."
"Brennan: Yeah, he's got the Flaming Sphere there. Cool, they are going to roll their save for Fear. Fear is a cone, I believe, right?"
"Ally: Yeah, a 30-foot cone."
"Brennan: 30-foot cone, cool. You could even, if you want to try to hit Becky, you can maybe like, poke your head in the hole and try to hit them both."
"Ally: Yeah, that's what I'm trying, yeah. I'll try to hit Becky and, uh..."
Murph: Whatever else.
"Brennan: I think this is the cone here, right?"
"Ally: Whatever else is there, yeah."
"Brennan: Yes, you can hit 'em all, yep, cool."
"Ally: Cool, all three of those people?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. We'll roll for the roach and the swarm. What's the DC on that?"
Ally: Your DC is 16.
"Brennan: Cool. Oh man, Becky does not flinch. The roach, however, goes-- [chittering] [screaming] Uh, what does Pete look like as he summons the power of pure nightmare?"
"Ally: Ooh, um… I look like a Defend… Defend, where are we?"
"Brennan: You're in Astoria, yeah."
Ally: Queens?
"Ally: Yeah, Defend Astoria, you know? I've made like a Facebook post of places not to give money to, and it's all the places that they're planning on building, like their WeWorks and shit."
"Brennan: You guys see Pete like, [ominous music] floating there as his eyes sink into his head. Shadows wrap around him and this Facebook post, boom, comes out of his chest."
"Ally: And it's just racking up likes by like, locals. [ticking]"
"Brennan: You see that the roach in front of you goes,"
"Roach: Ah! Socialist community organizing, run!"
"Brennan: Turns and just, this and the swarm fucking scatters, gone."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: That's Pete, it's gonna be these bugsters, baby. Misty, you're right over here, right?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool, this bug's just coming down for Sofia."
Emily: Come at me.
Zac: That's Winston.
Emily: Kingston.
"Zac: Kingston, sorry."
"Brennan: Cool, okay, so one's gonna come for Kingston, one's coming for Misty."
Siobhan: Bring it on!
"Brennan: 17 and 4. Misty, you take, uh, 5 damage from one of the bugsters' claws."
[health bar whirring]
Siobhan: That's not too bad.
"Brennan: And Kingston… Ooh, Kingston, you take, ba-ba-bum… 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 12. You take 14 damage [health bar whirring] from one of them slashing across you with a claw."
"Lou: Great, 21."
"Brennan: Hell yes, that's now going to be Misty, that's you."
Siobhan: Hm.
"Brennan: I'm sorry, at the end of your turn, Pete, you're actually gonna, you're still in that swarm of insects. I need another Constitution throw from you."
Emily: Blessed.
"Ally: Yeah, thank you."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: 22.
"Brennan: Okay, you still take half damage, which is gonna be, you take 8 points of damage."
[health bar whirring]
"Ally: Jesus, fuck. I'm down to 5."
"Brennan: Give me a Wild Magic check, too."
Ally: 15.
"Brennan: Cool, Misty, that's you."
Siobhan: I am going to cast… Is the shelf still moved from when the bodega cat moved it?
"Brennan: I'm gonna say, on a nat 20, yes, it is."
"Siobhan: Great. So I'm gonna cast, hm… I'm just gonna cast Thunderwave on this guy in front of me, so it's a Constitution saving throw."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: And it's 2d8 damage.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll it.
Siobhan: Which is 11.
"Brennan: You look at this guy. What does Misty say as she casts the spell, what happens?"
"Siobhan: I'm gonna say,"
"Misty: I heard you people have been complaining about loud noises at night. Well, listen to this, boom!"
"Brennan: Boom! [explosion banging] Misty's lightning doesn't crackle asymmetrically. It's like a perfect showbiz circle of lightning bolts, and this guy is fucking rent asunder and he goes, [screaming] You see this hipster lady in front of you instead goes like,"
"Hipster Bug: Oh, God, theater, gross! It's so schmaltzy, like so sincere! Like, oh, she should have some perspective. Postmodernism, ugh!"
Brennan: [splats] And she is toast.
"Siobhan: And then can I take a moment, just because we're in this fuckin' fancy adventuring bodega, to see if there's anything on the--"
Emily: We might come back after.
"Siobhan: Yeah, you're probably right, but just since we're here and I'm walking in your direction anyway, I can take a movement."
Brennan: Give me a Sleight of Hand check.
Siobhan: Great.
Murph: Sleight of Hand check.
"Siobhan: I have such good Sleight of Hand. Uh, 19?"
"Brennan: You see that there's a little golden, seashell, pearl-studded hand mirror."
"Misty: Oh, oh my god, I love this."
"Siobhan: But I do it in that famous person way of like, I'm gonna take this. I love this so much."
"Brennan: You see that the cat made of stars goes,"
[wind chimes shimmering]
La Gran Gata: How very interesting. I guess you can leave it on the counter and pay for it when you come back.
"Misty: Sure, can I just check it out for just a second?"
"La Gran Gata: Wait a minute, you're Misty Moore, right?"
"Misty: Yeah, that's right."
La Gran Gata: Maybe you'll post on social media?
"Misty: Oh, I would love to. You know, my friend Ricky, oh, I can't see—"
[violent buzzing]
La Gran Gata: We'll talk later.
"Brennan: So, that's awesome. You pocket that little magic thing."
Siobhan: And then I...
Brennan: Move.
Siobhan: Move to where it would be.
"Brennan: Cool, and you're out of the swarm of bugs, gotcha."
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool, cool, cool."
Ally: Is Bardic a bonus?
"Siobhan: Oh, it is. Can I, since Kingston is right there, I'm gonna say, like..."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Misty: Kingston, have you lost some weight?"
Kingston: Maybe.
Misty: You look great.
"Kingston: Okay, all right."
Misty: Eating a lot of salad.
[shimmering]
"Kingston: Ey, ey."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, Ricky, that's you."
"Zac: Okay, um. Okay, everybody."
"Ally: Okay, everybody."
Zac: I just realized that I have to do Concentration for that shield. What do I roll again for when that took 12 damage?
Brennan: You have to roll a DC 10 Constitution check.
"Zac: Okay, 19."
"Brennan: Cool, got it."
Zac: I think I'm just gonna go through this hole.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: And try to cover the next hole.
Brennan: Awesome.
Zac: So that he can't get away.
"Emily: That's a good move, great call."
"Siobhan: Good head, smart, smart."
"Brennan: Cool, so that's five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, so you get to about here."
"Zac: And I'm gonna ready an action. In case she tries to get by me, I'm gonna attack her."
"Brennan: Awesome, very, very cool."
"Siobhan: Oh, sick, there's another one on the other side."
"Brennan: Dope. Okay, you guys hear the beetle… Absolutely destroys two of the rat swarms."
[crashing]
[mice squeaking]
Murph: Oh no.
"Brennan: He's just taking care of business up on top of the roof. You hear, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!"
"Rats: Brothers, though we die, we do not die in vain!"
"Zac: Wait, is he not halted still?"
"Brennan: He has to stay on the roof, yeah."
"Zac: Oh, I gotcha."
"Kingston: I can't do everything, Ricky, all right? I got the damn--"
Ricky: I'm sorry.
"Kugrash: You should have said, ""Don't kill the rat."""
"Kingston: Okay, what the?"
"Brennan: Kugrash, it's gonna be you."
Ally: You should have blessed the rat!
Siobhan: You get one word with Command!
Lou: Y'all need to chill.
"Kugrash: Um, hey, Pete, I bless you with the blessings of some pigeons who died near a church, and I-- I'm gonna Cure Wounds. You know what, I'll do a third-level."
[holy shimmering]
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: My man.
Murph: Third-level Cure Wounds on Pete.
Ally: Thank you.
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
"Murph: Oh, God damn it. Yo, I literally rolled two 1 in a row, I am insane. 9, ba-ba-ba, plus my, okay, 14."
"Ally: Cool, thank you."
[health bar whirring]
"Brennan: Hell yeah. And is Kugrash moving anywhere, or what?"
"Murph: Yes, so that's an action, then I'm going to move in, just so I can see what's going on, but I think if I—"
"Brennan: You're still in the swarm of bugs there, by the way."
"Murph: Oh, shit, okay, I don't wanna be in the swarm of bugs."
[Emily sneezing]
"Murph: Bless you, okay. Does it go through the door?"
Brennan: It does go through the door.
Murph: Oh.
"Brennan: You're not in it anymore, Ricky. You got out of it."
"Zac: Okay, cool."
"Emily: You got out, man."
[sighing]
"Murph: Okay, I'm going to, yeah, I'm just gonna run in and get as far as I can get in here."
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and count out your movement."
Zac: Can you move your fireball?
"Murph: I can as a bonus action, but I think I have another idea. One..."
"Brennan: Two, three."
"Murph: So two, three, four, five. I'll go like, in the corner here."
"Brennan: Cool, you're out."
"Murph: Sweet, and then I'm going to use a bonus action to summon the, I'm gonna summon a juicy cockroach."
[holy shimmering]
Kugrash: These bugs were fuckin' here before you kids ruined the neighborhood!
"Murph: And I summon a juicy cockroach and me and Ricky get temp HP, 5 plus my druid level and plus advantage on Strength, so Strength saving throws."
[health bars whirring]
Zac: Yeah.
Murph: So 5.
"Emily: That's so good, because he might--"
"Murph: Plus my druid level, so 10."
"Ally: Wow, that's sick."
"Brennan: Rad, awesome. That's Kugrash. It's these roaches' turn. Are there any roaches even left in here?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, there's these, I don't know if this is--"
Emily: There's one right here.
"Brennan: Okay, there's one right here, too."
Siobhan: And there's two right here.
Brennan: There's two right here?
"Emily: Oh no, those guys left, but--"
Lou: Bugsters.
"Ally: Oh yeah, they have like, star magic or whatever, but whatever."
"Brennan: Yes, so these guys are gonna come for Ricky through here."
Ally: Do they pass through the sphere? Shit.
"Brennan: They do not pass through the sphere, and there's some back here, too?"
Ally: There's just one.
Siobhan: The bugster.
Lou: There's a bugster.
"Brennan: Oh, the bugster, don't worry about the bugster. These guys are gonna go after Ricky. Both miss. These guys are unlucky, and then that's gonna be Sofia, that's you."
"Emily: Okay, first off, before I exit this room, I saw what Misty did and I wanna look for a toy."
"Brennan: Cool, give me a Sleight of Hand."
"Emily: Okay. Oh, I knew this was gonna happen. I got a 10."
Brennan: The cat [chimes] winks at you. You roll with advantage.
Emily: Really?
"Brennan: Yeah, you saved the cat."
"Emily: Okay, that's gonna be a 21."
"Brennan: You see that there is a small golden ring that has an embossment on it of a closed fist, so like a bust of a fist on a small golden ring."
"Emily: Oh my God, I look at the cat and I start to put it on."
Sofia: Is this okay?
"La Gran Gata: Please, help yourself, you saved my life, and you gave me the good chin scratches."
Emily: I give some more chinny scratchies.
"La Gran Gata: Oh, this is so good. It is not the same with your paws."
Emily: And then I wanna run through the store and liberate these locals.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
Emily: So I run through this door.
Brennan: Go ahead and grab your figure and move it.
"Emily: Yeah, and then I think I'm just gonna go to town on this cocoon."
"Brennan: Dope, go ahead. I'll say that these are DC 15 Athletics checks, just to simplify it a little bit."
"Emily: Oh okay, cool. Ugh, oh wait, but I'm blessed. 15, okay, 4 plus 3, 7 plus 7, 14 god dammit."
"Brennan: So you rush in, pop, pop, pop. You get a lot of the way through, but they're still trapped in here."
Emily: Can I use my second attack to do another one?
"Brennan: Sure, give me another roll."
"Emily: Okay, that's gonna be a 27."
"Brennan: You rip the cocoons up to these two people in the laundromat and they go,"
"Locals: [panting] Oh my God, thank you, thank you, you're a hero. Do you think if I leave my stuff here, I can come back and get it later? Because I just have one more load in my apartment."
"Sofia: Absolutely.You know what, I'll fold it. I'll throw it in with some wrinkle stuff because it's probably gonna be pretty wrinkled after this."
"Locals: I can imagine, these bugs are from hell!"
"Sofia: Yeah, they really are, get out of here."
Brennan: These two locals sprint away.
Sofia: Tell everyone that Sofia the Sorceress saved you.
"Brennan: Two swarms left to attack, go for it."
"Murph: Sweet, get that fuckin' bug, guys. They are gonna attack the bug. I think, 12 and a 15."
"Brennan: 12 and 15, the 15 hits."
Murph: 8.
Ally: Ey.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You hear the beetle outside going,"
"Beetle: Ow, God damn it, what the fuck?"
"Brennan: And you hear the rats being like,"
"Rats: Though we be but little, we are fierce! Believe in yourselves!"
"Brennan: Great, so that's the swarms. Back to Becky. She looks at you, Ricky, with your readied action."
"Ricky: That's enough, come on."
"Ally: I can hear it from the other room, and I'm just like. [rubs the bridge of their nose]"
"Murph: So convincing, such a commanding voice. It must be killing you that there's a fireball right there."
Ricky: I hate it.
Brennan: I'm gonna need you to make a Wisdom saving throw.
Zac: Okay.
"Lou: You blessed, Ricky."
"Emily: Ricky, you're blessed."
"Zac: With Bless. Ugh, that's only 4, 8, 9."
"Brennan: Your saving throw, you got a 9?"
"Zac: I got a 9, but can I use a Luck point?"
"Brennan: Yes, you may."
"Zac: Great, great, great."
Emily: Okay.
"Ally: Come on, Ricky."
Brennan: So this is your second Luck point?
"Zac: This is my second Luck point and you've been bad to me, but I think you're gonna be good to me this time. Eh, so, I rolled a 6, so now I have 11."
Ally: Fuck.
Zac: Can I use a third Luck point?
Brennan: I don't think you can use a third luck point.
Murph: Had to ask.
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Let me double-check. Yeah, I don't think you can use another one."
"Zac: Okay, cool."
[Brennan sighing]
"Lou: Don't do that, don't sigh like that."
"Brennan: You see, Ricky, you stand with your axe fully ready, and you see Becky looks at you and says,"
"Becky: Um, I'm so sorry, I know you wanna hit me with that axe or whatever because you're like, I don't know, you hate change, but Pete's here now and a lot's gonna change."
Brennan: Your questing blade clatters to the ground. You guys watch Ricky double over. His body changes.
[flesh ripping]
[growling]
"Brennan: You see that she begins to try and warp you into becoming an insect. Pete, I will allow you, if you want to, to spend a sorcery point to not have this be as bad as it's going to be"
"Ally: Yeah, totally, yeah, yeah, yeah, so."
"Brennan: Pete, you try, [whooshing] but you realize that, again, her magic's coming from you and she reaches out. As you begin to turn into a bug, Pete does something. Your magic won't let you stop it, but you can change it."
"Emily: What if I give you a Ki point, too? Hah, I'm just kidding."
"Brennan: Ricky is gone, and a little dog is there on the ground."
"Siobhan: Oh, Ricky!"
[dog barking]
[groaning]
Siobhan: You're so cute!
Emily: That's cute.
Siobhan: It's a buff-ass dog.
"Brennan: Ricky, you have a hard time remembering any of the things that have happened. You know you have friends, you know you're a good boy, but it's hard to remember what else."
Zac: Okay.
"Kugrash: Hey Ricky, you can understand me, right? I'm a Circle of Shepherds druid, I can talk to animals."
Murph: Is he like a dog for all purposes?
"Brennan: You are still somewhere, Ricky Matsui, even if you don't remember that name, but yeah, you could talk to Kugrash."
Ricky: Who’s Ricky? I'm Ricky?
Kugrash: You're Ricky.
"Ricky: Oh great, okay."
Kugrash: You're a firefighter.
"Ricky: Yeah, I am? Awesome."
"Ally: Can I Mindlink with everyone? Can I roll an Insight check and see if me, like, running would take power away from them, or?"
Brennan: Make an Insight check to see what would happen.
Ally: 2.
"Brennan: You don't know, you don't know your own magic."
Ally: Fucker.
"Brennan: Becky turns you into a dog, flies overhead, rushes in here. You can still try to take your attack, but now you're attacking with a dog's attack bonus."
"Zac: I know the thing did this to me, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, you do."
"Zac: Well, I'm just gonna try to bite it."
"Brennan: Go ahead and roll an attack roll. For a dog, I'm--"
Lou: Is the dog blessed? Did I bless the dog?
"Zac: The dog is still blessed, it's still there."
Emily: A blessed dog!
Zac: I don't get two attacks now.
"Brennan: Just one, I'm afraid."
Lou: A dog only attacks once.
"Zac: It's not a disease, right?"
"Lou: Yeah, I can't cure this?"
Zac: You're blessed.
Siobhan: I can maybe do something.
"Emily: If you hit with, wait, wait, does he still have Sentinel, even as a dog?"
Brennan: I believe you still have Sentinel.
"Emily: If he hits a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes zero for the rest of the turn."
"Brennan laughs, wheezing a little."
Siobhan: Oh my God.
"Zac: All right, well, let's see if I..."
"Brennan: Let's see, your bonus to this is you have a plus 3 to hit."
Zac: My dog bonus.
Brennan: Plus 3. You roll with a plus 3.
Zac: This is hard.
Emily: But you have a chance.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll.
"Zac: Okay, Bless. Um, a 15."
Brennan: You hit!
[cast cheering]
"Brennan: So you see, Becky turns you into a dog, you reach up, latch onto one of her insect legs and—"
[dog growling]
"Brennan: Keep her from flying further away. Hell yes. So, she's just right over here."
[growling]
"Becky: Ah, bad dog, fuck you, bad dog!"
[growling]
Brennan: You actually can roll a 1d6 plus 1 damage.
Zac: A 2. 2 damage.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Really bad time over here.
"Ally: Wow, I'm so sorry, Ricky."
"Brennan: But you do see that the cloud of insects disappears as she turns you into a dog. That's going to be Kingston, that's you."
"Lou: Great, can I take a step back and cast Guiding Bolt on this last bugster that's still in here?"
"Brennan: Where is it? Oh yeah, this person right here?"
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Lou: Great.
"Emily: Yeah, fuck 'em up."
"Zac: Oh my God, I'm a dog."
"Lou: Uh, 17?"
Brennan: A 17 hits.
"Lou: Great, so come on, 5. Got a 9, got a 14, 18."
"Brennan: Uh, 18 damage?"
Lou: 18 damage.
Brennan: You extend your hand.
[ominous music]
"Brennan: The stars around the bodega come to your call and are released, phew, as like, little bulbs of streetlamp light,"
[rapid shooting]
Brennan: And eviscerate this bugster. They are no more.
Lou: Fantastic.
"Brennan: So, and then your movement."
"Lou: Great, and I'll come on in. Let's go one, two, three, four."
Brennan: Mhm.
"Lou: Five, six."
Brennan: Cool.
"Kugrash: Welcome to the party, Kingston. Ricky's a dog now."
Kingston: What?
"Kugrash: Yeah, it's fucked up."
Kingston: Like a little—
"Kugrash: Like, he's this fucking dog right here."
Brennan: You see there's a dog pulling on this—
"Emily: What breed, what breed?"
"Brennan: I think he's like a large, brindled, gray and black Akita."
[Emily gasping]
"Ally: Aw, sweet."
Siobhan: So cute.
Emily: Cute.
"Brennan: Kinda like a wolfy, hunting little dog."
"Ally: Fuck yeah, Akitas are dope."
"Sofia: Hi, do you like chinny rubs?"
Ally: Aw.
Zac: I'm still attacking this giant wasp.
"Brennan: Incredible, that's going to be… That's Kingston, roaches go. These two roaches are gonna go for Kugrash now, ba-ba-bum. Both miss, not even a single roach has hit. Sofia, that's you."
"Emily: Okay, I wanna hop up onto this row of dryers and then beeline it for the wasp and jump onto her, attacking her."
"Brennan: Hell yes, so that's gonna be..."
Emily: With a Flurry of Blows.
Zac: A beeline for the wasp?
"Brennan: Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, fourty."
"Emily: And then I have an extra 10, yeah."
"Brennan: That's right, because of the cat, cool."
Emily: But I wanna dive onto her.
"Brennan: Oh, do you wanna try to grapple her or do you wanna make attacks?"
"Emily: No, I mean I wanna make attacks, but airborne."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Go for it.
Emily: And I'm gonna Flurry of Blows also.
Brennan: Jesus.
"Emily: Okay, does a 17 hit and does a 24 hit? I guess they do, because you had a 15."
"Zac: Yeah, hopefully."
"Brennan: You see she throws a shield up, like a magical shield."
[magical shimmering]
"Emily: Okay, well, I'm also blessed, so let me add 2 to the, so it's 19 and 24."
Brennan: Hold on one second.
Emily: And 19 and 28.
"Brennan: 19 and 28, Jesus. The 19, yeah, the 19 hits."
Ally: That's you.
"Emily: The 19 hits, as does the 28."
"Emily: Ugh, okay."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll damage.
Emily: So I'm gonna hit her for..
Ally: You're so tall.
"Emily: 9 and 7, so I hit her for 16, and then I'm Flurry of Blows-ing, so I'm gonna hit her twice more."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: And let's see. 2, 3, so 12 plus 8. 20 and 11 plus 8, 19."
Brennan: Another 19 damage?
"Emily: No, no, no, another, yeah."
Brennan: 20 and then 19 to hit? Both of those hit.
"Emily: Okay, so that's gonna be another 10 and another 10, so then another 20!"
Murph: Whoa.
Ally: Wow.
"Emily: [punching] Pow, pow, pow, pow."
"Brennan: You guys see, I don't, are you drunk anymore after the whole thing with the cat?"
Emily: I'm wasted!
Emily sways around wildly.
"Brennan: You're fuckin', yeah, you see that you are, you vomit a little bit in your mouth."
[mystical shimmering]
"Brennan: Stars are swirling around you. You see that the stars are actually like, pinging off of Sofia to keep her up, and again, these like, twirling—"
"Emily: I wanna bicycle kick, Liu Kang style, for one of my attacks."
"Brennan: Oh yeah, you like hop up and—"
Emily: With stilettos.
"Brennan: Yeah, pow-pow-pow-pow-pow. You stab her four times in the head with your stiletto heels. She is on death's fucking door. Her weird bug skull is caved in. She is so close to being dead."
"Emily: Oh, yeah."
Brennan: That's gonna be the swarms.
Emily: And then I land and chinny rub. [mimes petting the Ricky dog]
"Brennan: Land, chinny rubs, an insane round. The swarms go, well actually, sorry, no, the beetle."
"Emily: Yo, those rats, though."
Murph: My rats.
"Brennan: Oh, the rats are fuckin' toast, they're done. The rat swarms are done. Becky vanishes in mist. [whooshing] Vanish, gone."
Ally: Fuck.
Zac: Even though her movement's zero?
Emily: Even though she had a dog attack?
"Brennan: She just did a spell, just a spell."
"Emily: Oh, she's probably still here. She's like, probably gaseous form or something."
Zac: Am I a goner from fire here?
Brennan: No.
"Siobhan: Or Misty Step, maybe."
"Brennan: Phew, vanishes. That's going to be..."
"Zac: I'm just a dog, sniffing around."
"Emily: Where could she, she has to see where she Misty Steps to, right?"
Murph: Did she Misty Step or did she just teleport or something?
"Siobhan: Yeah, who knows?"
"Emily: He said she disappears in mist, which feels misty."
"Siobhan: Yeah, okay."
"Brennan: Yeah, it's gonna be Pete's turn."
"Ally: Okay, cool. I'm still like floating, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, you are still floating, that's correct."
Ally: Could I float kinda over these bugs and just go straight from door to door into this new place?
"Brennan: Yeah, you totally could."
Ally: Okay.
Murph: How fucked up are you?
Ally: I'm at 19 now.
"Brennan: One, two, three."
Ally: Which isn't that bad.
"Brennan: Four, five, six. You can take a double move if you want to keep moving. Thank you."
"Ally: Ugh, a bunch of bugs and people. Oh no, it's up there."
Siobhan: What the fuck is this?
"Ally: Yeah, some dude. Okay, so I'm peeking my head in there, and so I'm gonna cast Scorching Ray."
"Brennan: Awesome, go ahead and make your attacks."
"Ally: Uh, it's how many?"
"SI: Three, I think."
"Zac: It's three, yeah."
"Murph: It's three, yeah."
Ally: Can I use this?
Murph: Yep.
"Ally: Sheesh, come on, man."
"Murph: Plus your spell attack modifier, so 12, 18, and 25?"
"Ally: And I have Bless, so I could bless that 12 with a 1."
Brennan: So 13?
Ally: 13.
"Brennan: 13, 14, and 26, or something like that, or how much is it?"
"Murph: It's 13, 18, and 25."
"Brennan: 13, 18, 25, awesome. Who are you trying to hit?"
Ally: I can throw the 13 on a regular cockroach and then the 25 on the hipster cockroach and then the 18 on the other cockroach.
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and roll damage."
Ally: Cool.
"Murph: So that's a 2d6 on each, or is it?"
"Lou: [quietly, crosstalk to Emily] You keep a pair of scissors on you this whole time?"
"Brennan: 2d6 on each, yeah."
Ally: 2d6 on each.
Emily: Yeah.
Ally: Two. Yeah!
"Ally rolls rather aggressively. One of their dice falls off the table, which causes a much louder thump after a moment."
"Murph: Oh, shit."
"Siobhan: Ally, good God."
Ally: What was it?
"Murph: Just sit, it's gone."
Ally: What was it though?
Murph: It's down there.
"Ally: Oh, the water bottles fell."
Emily: It doesn't count if it's on the floor unless it's a 6.
Murph: It doesn't count if it's not a 6.
"Brennan: No, it does not count on the floor."
Murph: Roll it again.
"Ally: All right, I got three 6 though, bitches."
Brennan: You have to roll it again for each because they're each a separate attack.
Ally: What's that?
"Brennan: You can't decide how to determine them, so like."
"Ally: Oh, I got you."
"Brennan: So we'll say that's one, that's one, and then roll that dice."
"Ally: Okay, yeah, 5. Fuck yeah."
Brennan: Okay.
"Ally: 12, 11, and 3."
"Brennan: Okay, which one is which? So you're hitting the bugster with which one? right in the doorway, and then three on the cockroach that's further away."
"Brennan: Cool, one of these roaches is--"
[fire blazing]
"Brennan: Just toast. That one takes some serious damage. Hell yeah, that's now going to be… This bugster's going to, phew, rush in here, because you're like, at the doorway basically. He's gonna rush in and attempt to fuck you up."
"Ally: Oh, I cast Shield so that my AC goes up by five."
"Brennan: As your reaction, cool."
"Zac: If something comes in within five feet of me, is it within five feet of me? I can use Sentinel on it."
"Brennan: You could, but he's just in the doorway right now."
"Zac: Oh, okay, yeah."
Brennan: He's fuckin' with Pete. That's gonna be a miss.
Zac: I'm a very good dog.
"Brennan: That's also gonna be a miss on Pete with that shield, so you burn a first-level spell slot for the shield."
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: Bugster misses. That's now going to be Misty.
Ally: Cool.
Siobhan: I would like to cast Dispel Magic on Young Master Matsui.
Emily: Ooh.
"Brennan: Ooh, let me double-check this real quick."
"Siobhan: So if it's a third-level or lower, the target, it just ends, and if it's above a third-level, it's DC 10 plus the spell's level against my attack roll."
Brennan: You have to beat a DC 14.
Siobhan: All right.
Ally: Okay.
Murph: Are you blessed or anything?
Siobhan: No.
"Ally: Bardic, or?"
"Siobhan: I can't give myself, can I give myself Bardic Inspiration? I didn't think so, that seemed like some bullshit. Nat 20, baby."
[cast cheers]
"Ally: [screaming] Yes! This fuckin' game! You're kidding me, oh my God!"
[howling]
Brennan: You step in.
Ally: [holding up a picture of a gray Akita on their phone] Say good-bye.
"Misty: You were a good boy, Ricky."
"Emily: I'm just gonna be, I'm still chinny rubbing him as he transforms back."
"Brennan: You see, Misty, you step in, raise your hand aloft."
Ally: What the fuck?
"Brennan: Shape changing magic is your bread and fuckin' butter. You guys see, I mean like, the broken hip and some scary stuff going on. The wind kicks up and for a moment, you guys see a face of Misty that is not the fun, vivacious, older, whip-smart person, but a face of regal beauty from a timeless age and a land beyond dreaming, and you lift the form of this animal, and you guys see literally that like, the dog turns brighter,"
[magical shimmering]
"Brennan: And as an image of light, just phew, raises through the ceiling and vanishes and Ricky's just where the dog was."
Zac: I'm just naked. I'm sorry.
"Sofia, who had been giving dog Ricky chinny rubs, immediately snatches her hands back."
Ally: Just ripped.
"Brennan: I'm gonna say though, I'm gonna roll something. Ricky, your ears are a little bit pointier than they used to be and you can smell a whole bunch of stuff you didn't use to be able to smell."
Ricky: [sniffing] What happened?
Brennan: In-fucking-credible.
Ally: Wow.
"Siobhan: And then I'd like to, I mean, I'd still like to take a move."
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. There's a bunch of shit going on over there."
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
Brennan: If you wanna swap that dog out for Ricky.
Lou: Swap that dog out.
"Brennan: Ha, swap the dog out."
"Ally: Ricky, I'm floating above you."
"Siobhan: I mean, there's not much I can do in here. I guess I'll just hang out down here, and then since I'm here, I'm gonna say to Ricky,"
"Misty: Ricky, you made a great dog, but you're an even better firefighter."
[magical shimmering]
Zac: I just cry a little bit.
Siobhan: Bardic Inspiration.
"Brennan: You start crying, the axe—"
[whooshing]
Brennan: Comes up off the ground into your hand. It is your turn.
"Ricky: Oh, did I miss anything? I'm assuming not."
"Kugrash: Uh, nah."
"Kingston: We'll catch you up later, go, go."
Pete: There's a bugster right through that door.
Kugrash: The big bug disappeared.
Sofia: Did you see the cat?
"Ricky: I missed all of that, I think."
Sofia: Oh my God.
"Zac: I'm just gonna go through the door and I guess, since the bug hipster, the bugster right there is right in front of me, I'm gonna have to smack it."
"Brennan: Yeah, hell yeah. You go to the doorway. The bug's just in the doorway. Go ahead and take your attack."
Zac: First one is like 24.
Brennan: That definitely hits.
Zac: Second one is more.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and roll damage."
"Zac: Damage is 1d8, sorry."
"Brennan: 1d8's right there, roll it."
Zac: 9 and 12.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Brennan: Is that?
Zac: 9 and 12.
Brennan: 21?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see Ricky back in his full form. God, he's a jacked dude. Steps through the doorway and you see this bugster goes like,"
"Bugster: Oh, what's up, man? Hey, so we're kind of super into killing you guys right now."
"Brennan: Wham, your axe cleaves his chest apart, green goo flies everywhere. [goo oozing] This bugster is dead."
Ally: Yes!
Emily: Whoo!
Ricky: Always hated how you make me feel a little dumb.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, that's going to be, you guys hear… Boom, boom, boom. [crashing] And you hear a smash in the bodega as the beetle [crashing] collapses into the store."
Siobhan: Roll up.
"Brennan: That's now going to be, that was the beetle, Kugrash, that's you."
"Murph: Sweet, okay. I guess first thing's first, I got a little bonus action, so I'm gonna move the fireball onto one of these little cockroach guys."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: So they do a Dex save, or the one guy does a Dex save. And takes 8 if he doesn't save."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, I don't think those guys have been injured before, so yes, you horribly burn one of them."
"Murph: Great, and then, you know what? Let's keep, yeah, I'm gonna keep fuckin' with this big guy over here. I would like to Conjure Animals and use it as a spell. The last one was Rat King Crown. I think it's up to you what I make, but I'm thinkin' some kind of like, stray dogs or stray cats or something like that."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: Like, I can do up to eight beasts of Challenge Rating a quarter or lower, so I would like to make eight."
Brennan: Eight beasts of Challenge Rating quarter or lower.
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yes. You see, Jesus."
"Murph: Or I could do two, like, beefy dogs. I think a dire wolf might be Challenge Rating one."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: That would be two.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, I'm gonna say that you go ahead and summon, yeah, you summon some crazy stuff."
"Murph: Oh, hell yeah."
Brennan: An enormous fucking spider jumps down and this huge stray street mutt all comes running in from the outside and begin to attack.
Emily: Whoa.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll initiative for them. They'll act on the same initiative.
"Murph: Sweet, 17 plus whatever their Dex is."
"Brennan: Um, cool."
"Murph: Sick, sick."
"Siobhan: Tight, tight, tight."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Lou: Sick, sick."
Brennan: That's Kug.
[tense music]
"Brennan: These roaches are about to go. These guys rush up here. They're gonna take some swings at Ricky. This guy gets away from the, these two are coming for Kug, ba-ba-bum."
"Zac: Any of them within five feet of me, the ones that go for Kug?"
"Ally: Oh, there's one down there?"
"Brennan: There's one down here? Oh, this one, yeah, here you go. This guy's coming for Kingston. These guys are going for Misty. Here we go, these two coming for Ricky. They missed, he's coming for Kugrash."
Zac: Do I get to hit the ones coming for Kugrash if they are within five?
"Brennan: They're not. Oh, they actually are within five feet of you."
Zac: Or I get maybe one?
"Brennan: Ricky, go ahead, one of them goes to attack Kugrash. You get a swing on it."
"Zac: All right. Ooh, 19 plus, yeah."
"Brennan: Yeah, huge, go ahead and roll damage."
"Zac: Uh, d8 plus a d8."
"Murph: Kill 'em, please. Kill them, kid."
"Zac: Oh yeah, 8 plus 7."
[flesh ripping]
"Brennan: Hah, decapitated. You don't even look, you just wail out behind you and annihilate one of these roaches, awesome. That was the roach. I'm actually gonna roll a Luck check here real quick. You just killed the roach that otherwise would have scored a nat 20 against Kugrash."
[various shocked “ohh”ing from the cast]
"Murph: I have no idea so I'm just like,"
"Kugrash: Eh, good job, kid, you killed a cockroach."
Brennan: I'm gonna need a Constitution check from you.
Murph: All right.
[groaning]
"Murph: I'm blessed but I'm not blessed in real life, so I got an 11."
"Zac: Oh, yeah. I guess my spells--"
Brennan: 11 saves.
"Murph: Oh, good."
"Zac: My AC thing is gone, probably."
"Brennan: Yes, Concentration thing, yeah. You take seven points of damage."
[health bar whirring]
"Murph: Okay. I need to, 7 points of damage, I need to maintain Concentration to keep my dog and my spider."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll. Go ahead and roll.
"Murph: Yeah, come on, baby, stay with me. Is it a check or a saving throw?"
Brennan: Saving throw.
Murph: I can do blessing?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Murph: Great. Truly incredible, truly incredible."
Ally: Off of a roll from a 22.
Murph: I got a fucking 7.
"Brennan: You see that the spider and dog both come in and the dog goes,"
"Dog: [deep voice] Kugrash, my mentor. I've come to, ah, this guy's big!"
"Brennan: And he turns and runs out the door. The spider says,"
"Spider: [posh British] We shall play another time, Kugrash of the sewers. I have answered your call, but I am too scared to fight."
"Kugrash: Hey, fucking bums. I'm your Goddamn druid."
"Emily: I think you should bring that spider back again some time, I like him."
Ally: What was that smoking hot-ass spider?
Murph: He's a fucking punk. He says he's gonna show up and then he doesn't show up.
Ally: Jack of all trades.
"Emily: Ooh, I like spider."
"Brennan: Sofia, it's gonna be you."
"Emily: Okay, so I want to sort of listen to if I hear anyone on the ceiling. I'm trying to figure out if Becky might be up there through the roof."
Brennan: Give me a Perception check.
"Emily: Okay, it's gonna be… Uh, 19."
Brennan: You don't think she's on the roof.
"Emily: Okay, then I am gonna run through here and go through here."
Brennan: Okay.
"Emily: So, one, two, oh, I'm gonna let them both get opportunity attacks on me."
"Brennan: Cool, you could also do the Flurry of Blows thing and do the, you know, like--"
"Emily: Okay, I'll do that. So I'm gonna come here and I'm gonna Flurry of Blows one of them."
"Brennan: Cool, make an attack."
"Emily: Okay. Oh, I don't think I'm gonna hit either one."
Siobhan: Wow.
"Ally: Do you have Bardic, or?"
Siobhan: That is a 1 and a 2.
"Emily: No, but I do get to add, I'll add, let's see. Let's go for the 4 for this one. So does 14 hit?"
Brennan: 14 does hit.
"Emily: Okay, what about 12?"
Brennan: A 12 does not.
"Emily: Okay, well, I'll hit them with one. And that's gonna be 7."
"Brennan: You hit the injured one, dead, pff."
"Emily: Sweet, and then I still have two unarmed strikes. Can I go at the other guy?"
"Brennan: Yeah, if you want."
"Emily: Yeah, okay, and then… Oh, that's kinda crooked, but whatever. Then I'll, okay, so I'll do… So 19, yeah, they both hit, let's just say that."
"Brennan: Cool, hell yeah, go for it."
"Emily: And then, 6... [tense music] Uh, 15."
"Brennan: Toast, pff."
"Emily: Sweet, and then I'm gonna use my Drunken Technique to take a Dash and then hop through here."
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: Okay, so you Flurry, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: So you don't take attacks of opportunity and your speed, I think, plus 10. Plus the 10 you get from the--"
Emily: So I'm sixty.
"Brennan: So that's five, ten, fifteen, twenty,"
"Emily: Oh, I can do Acrobatic, if you want me to do Acrobatic checks."
"Brennan: So it's just five, ten, fifteen, twenty. Yeah, give me an Acrobatics to clear the hole."
"Emily: Okay, so I got a 16. Is she in here?"
Brennan: She is not in there.
Emily: God damn.
Siobhan: What's in there?
"Ally: Oh, it's a pizza parlor."
Brennan: It's a pizzeria. A little pizza parlor.
"Siobhan: Oh nice, get a slice."
"Brennan: So, okay, that's gonna be five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, fourty."
Murph: Jumpin' about.
Siobhan: Go to the next hole.
"Emily: Go to the next one, I want to go into here."
"Brennan: Uh, forty-five, fifty."
"Murph: Shit, this is—"
"Ally: Oh, we can't back you up, though."
Murph: This is insane.
Emily: That's okay.
Brennan: You get in the pub.
"Emily: Ooh, lively."
Zac: Lively.
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Siobhan: Oh, you're in the kitchen?"
Brennan: You're in the kitchen.
Siobhan: What's in there?
"Brennan: So that's gonna be, yeah, give me one more Acrobatics."
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: I mean, I definitely make it."
Brennan: You are standing--
Emily: On a lit stove?
"Brennan: Not on a lit stove. You're like, where can I get your figure--"
Emily: I can be on the stove.
"Brennan: Cool, you're on the stove. You look out and hear Becky over in this room, talking to another bugster."
"Emily: I look through that little porthole and I'm like,"
"Sofia: Caught ya, bitch."
"Brennan: But you guys see like, pow-pow-pow, take out these two roaches, and just, your Acrobatics stat, when you go through both of these holes, you are not like parkour leaping. You're more like just, flinging your limp body."
Emily: Can we say in one of them I do like a home plate slide through the ooze? So I'm covered in ooze.
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Murph: Oh, gross."
"Brennan: Yes, you're like, pff. You get through here. There's like pizza people that are all tied up in this room, but there's no active monsters. There's like some little ones. You're in here with the big roach, though. That's your movement and action. Truly, what an insane move."
Emily: Whoo!
Brennan: That's going to be--
Emily: I think I beat my chest and chug my CamelBak of wine.
Brennan: Hell yeah. I'm gonna need you now to make a… I'm gonna need you to make another Constitution saving throw.
"Emily: Constitution, okay. It's as good as it could be. Okay, 16."
Brennan: 16.
Emily: 16.
"Brennan: One, two, three… You take 22 points of damage."
[health bar whirring]
Zac: From that guy?
Brennan: From Becky.
Zac: Oh.
Ally: What are you at?
Brennan: Becky looks at you.
Emily: 8. [nervously laughs]
"Brennan: Yeah, Becky looks at you and goes,"
"Becky: Um, you can not come in here! This is trespassing, we're making a hive!"
[whooshing]
[splashing]
Brennan: Sucks the water out of your body again.
"Sofia: Oh, thank you. [laughing] I look so good."
"Ally: Good, God damn it. It's like."
Brennan: And then Becky backs over to this corner. That's going to be Kingston.
"Lou: Kingston, uh, okay. Wow, wow, wow, there's a lot going on."
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
Lou: Me and Misty are trapped by bugs. Everybody's about to have to fight that big bug. I guess I'll cast Sacred Flame on the bug next to me.
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: So it has to make a Dexterity saving throw.
Brennan: It fails.
"Lou: Fantastic, I'll roll 2d8. 6 and 7, 13."
[whooshing]
[flames blazing]
"Brennan: You light this thing up, it is toast."
"Lou: All right, great, and then can I move just down this way?"
"Brennan: Yeah, just take six squares of movement."
"Lou: One, two, three, four, five, six, there we go."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, that's gonna be Pete."
"Ally: What is Dash again, if I take a Dash action?"
Brennan: It just means you're using your action to move twice as far as normal.
"Ally: Oh okay, I'll do that to get as further as I can."
"Brennan: Cool, so you're gonna go like--"
"Ally: If I'm floating, does it add anything extra to my?"
Brennan: You don't need to make an Acrobatics check to get through the hole.
"Ally: Cool, yeah, I'll do that."
"Brennan: Cool, so this is gonna be five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, fourty, fourty-five, fifty. Yeah, you make it. You're floating here, above the cockroach in the kitchen with Misty. That's your full turn, that's your movement. Unless you have a bonus action, that's your movement and your action."
"Ally: I don't have a bonus action, so uh, yeah."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, cool. That is going to be the bugsters. This dude rushes through, boom, through the bathrooms. He's gonna go one, two, three, four, five. He's gonna take some swings at you, Pete, flying up there near the roof."
Ally: Cool.
Brennan: That's a miss. That's a hit.
"Ally: Can I cast Shield again, for 5 plus AC?"
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Ally: Then I would be up to 18.
"Brennan: Okay, unfortunately, bypassed the Shield. He got higher than an 18."
Emily: Wild Magic roll.
Ally: Hm?
Emily: Wild Magic.
"Ally: Oh, yeah."
Brennan: I'm gonna need you to make a Constitution saving throw.
"Ally: Oh, okay, cool. 7, I'll use my Bardic."
Lou: And your Bless.
"Ally: Another 7, so that’s 14, and a 3, so 17. And then what do I add, oh?"
"Brennan: You see that this bugster goes,"
Bugster: I've been getting really into biting people recently.
[growling]
[chittering]
"Brennan: And latches on, deals you 6 points of damage."
[health bar whirring]
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: What are you at right now?
Ally: Now I'm down to 13.
Brennan: That is bugster's turn. Let me look if there's any more bugsters left out there.
Ally: Thank you for the Bardic.
Brennan: That's now going to be Misty.
"Siobhan: Um, hm. I'm gonna just risk an attack of opportunity from these little buggy guys and come 'round where--"
Brennan: Where Kingston is?
"Siobhan: Where Kingston is, and I would like to cast Phantasmal Force in front of this hole."
"Brennan: Oh, awesome."
"Siobhan: And I would like to cast it in the form of the building inspector, and the building inspector is like,"
"Building Inspector: No, no, buddy, there's asbestos in here. Absolutely can't come in here."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, does he make a Wisdom save or something like that?"
Siobhan: It's an Intelligence save.
"Brennan: Ooh, he's not very intelligent."
"Siobhan: And if it's a human-shaped target, a phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target for 1d6 of psychic damage, as well."
"Brennan: This beetle rolled a 2, which gives him a negative 2 as his final roll."
"Siobhan: Oh, he's real dumb."
"Brennan: He's real dumb. Again, every person, every phantasmal thing you make, always looks like a costumed version of it, so there's a beautiful building inspector. Like, young woman, [mystical shimmering] got a shining smile, little official thing, a little white hardhat, goes like,"
"Building Inspector: Sir, you absolutely can't be renovating in here! You haven't gotten the proper [yelling] clearances!"
Brennan: Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Go ahead and roll damage.
Siobhan: 5.
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: You see that the beetle goes like,"
"Beetle: Ah, I'm sorry, I thought we had everything checked out. You know, I got these guys on retainer. My crew, they wanna work, argh!"
"Brennan: And you see, incredible, Ricky, it's gonna be you."
Zac: I'm just gonna run forward as far as I can go.
"Brennan: Fuck yeah, dude."
"Zac: So I'll take, can I do..."
"Brennan: So that's five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty. You can get thirty here. Go ahead and make an Athletics check."
"Zac: Yeah. Uh, that's, yeah."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: 20.
"Brennan: So that's forty, forty-five."
Zac: I'm gonna go through the left.
Brennan: Okay.
Zac: Well.
Ally: Hm. What's your health?
"Zac: I'm pretty good right now, but I'm wondering if--"
Brennan: Make one last Athletics check for me.
"Zac: Ooh, that one's only a 9."
"Brennan: Okay, you do not clear this fine. There's some webbing here you gotta like, slash away at a little bit."
Zac: Cool.
Brennan: But you make it all the way there.
Zac: Probably should have healed y'all.
Ally: Should have what?
Zac: Healed you all.
"Brennan: The beetle leaves this entrance and begins to stalk down and try to pummel through this way. Let's see if it can even make its way through the shelves. Oh, that's a nat 1."
Murph: Hah.
"Brennan: You hear the beetle be like,"
"Beetle: All right, all right, listen. I'll find another way through."
"Brennan: And you hear a voice say,"
La Gran Gata: You will find no other way through there. My number one job is to make sure that the little roaches don't eat the Oreos and Kit Kats on the shelves. [intense growling]
"Brennan: And you hear the beetle go,"
"Beetle: Ah, ah, ah!"
Brennan: As La Gran Gata does something horrifying to this beetle in the other room.
Emily claps.
Ally: Yeah.
"Emily: Go, baby."
"Brennan: That's going to be, then it's Pete. Oh, it's Ricky, Beetle, Kugrash, that's you, baby."
"Murph: Sweet, I'm in this pathetic little duel with this little guy. [laughing] I'm just gonna say,"
"Kugrash: Yeah, fuck you, buddy."
"Murph: And I spit on him and I'm just gonna run away from him, I get as far as I can get."
Brennan: You spit on a roach.
"Ally: Fuck you, buddy."
Brennan: So this is an attack of opportunity.
"Murph: Oh, great."
"Brennan: So you're gonna go five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five."
"Murph: That's as far as I can get. Oh, you know what, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna use my full action to do a Dash action to try to get through the hole."
Brennan: Yep.
"Murph: Um, cool, cool."
Brennan: Just go ahead and give me Athletics or Acrobatics to make it through the hole.
"Murph: Oh God. Uh, Acrobatics 18."
Ally: Acrobatics.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you scurry your little rat ass all the way up here by the pizza parlor."
Murph: Hell yeah.
"Zac: Are people in your aura now, are they?"
"Murph: So now I wanna use a bonus action to, I can move the aura 60 feet."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Murph: So I wanna move it in the middle of the room. About there.
"Brennan: Great, put it in the middle of the room. These two roaches are coming for Sofia. One of them hits. I'm gonna need you to make a Constitution saving throw."
Emily: It's gonna be 18.
"Brennan: 18, no poison damage. You take 6 points of piercing damage. [health bar whirring] [whistling] Sofia, that's you."
"Emily: Okay, I am actually--"
"Ally: There's a door right there, Sofia."
"Emily: Yeah, I'm gonna burst through this. I'm gonna cast Patient Defense. I'm gonna use it, or [laughs] cast, who am I? I'm gonna use a Ki point for Patient Defense, so I will be able to use a Dodge action, and I just wanna jump through here and go after her."
"Brennan: Gotcha, cool, cool. Give me an Acrobatics to move through enemy space."
Emily: Okay. That is 21.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you easily clear the movement. You're on the bar here. I'm gonna roll some attacks against you. They got disadvantage, though."
"Emily: Wait, but I have Dodge."
Brennan: Dodge is not disengage.
Emily: I thought Dodge was--
Brennan: Dodge is everyone has disadvantage to try to hit you for a turn.
"Emily: Oh, okay, sure, yeah, I'll do that."
"Brennan: Cool, all of them miss."
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: Yeah, you have plenty of movement left, you jump--"
Emily: And then I wanna go for her.
"Brennan: You see that she's just standing in the corner. She's like getting the spell energy ready. She goes,"
"Becky: Come on, we've been fictional for so long. We get to be real today. Won't you let us be real?"
"Sofia: That is so heart-breaking, but you can't take other peoples' reality away to be real."
[chittering]
"Emily: And then I fuckin' attack her! Does a, okay, I'm assuming that a 25 hits."
Brennan: 25 hits.
Emily: And then does a 20 hit?
Brennan: 20 does not hit.
"Emily: Ugh, okay, well, I'll hit her once at least."
Ally: Jesus Christ.
Emily: Hit her for 9 and then I'm gonna use my left hook.
"Zac: Oh, I think she's..."
Ally: I think she's dead.
"Brennan: Emily, I'm gonna stop you right here. [dramatic music] You run across, you gear up, phew, you're like, ""Here it comes."" You get ready for this whole fuckin' combo move bicycle kick, you see that she gets the spell energy ready, [magical buzzing] and you swing out and you see, you hear a voice in the back of your head again, once again say,"
"Voice: Hey, kid, knock 'em dead."
"[tense music, subway horn honking]"
"Brennan: Whomp, the fist on your golden ring glows bright, flames streak off of your fist, and you obliterate this bug lady's fuckin' head."
[whooshing]
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Zac: I'm looking through the hole and I'm just like,"
Ricky: Awesome.
[laughing]
"Emily: But I'm so drunk that I don't know that I did it, so I hit her dead body for another 8."
[squishing]
[triumphant music]
"Brennan: You see a kind of gruesome sight of just Sofia pummeling this dead body. You see that the bugs all begin to… The bugs start to turn, like, what were giant cockroaches become like, cockroaches, beetles, [crackling] and now a rhino beetle, then some other thing. They become like chimeric and changing, and they just float up [magical whooshing] and you just see that the Umbral Arcana begins to return and the rent area begins to leave. The beetle is totally gone in the other room. The bugsters, the roaches, all of them vanish and disappear."
"Siobhan: Phew, what about the people who are gummed up? Can we free them, or have they freed themselves?"
Brennan: You can go and start freeing them. All of them remember what they saw.
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: So they start going like,"
Bystander: What happened here? There were bad bug people. Is this a flash mob?
"Kingston: Yeah, it's a flash mob of sorts."
"Misty: Yeah, Improv Everywhere, you heard of them? They're great guys."
"Brennan: You see that one of them goes in and you see that the Umbral Arcana starts to like seep back in, and you can tell that he kind of doesn't believe it, but he goes like,"
"Bystander: Yeah, yeah, those guys are crazy."
"Kingston: Aren't they practical jokesters? [laughing] On truTV, yeah."
Misty: I love that show.
"Kingston: This is an episode of Pranked. It's those four, bunch of guys."
Misty: It's a brand new viral campaign.
"Bystander: I love jokes, I love truTV. I love especially [looks directly into the camera] Adam Ruins Everything."
Emily: Yeah.
Lou: What a show.
Brennan: What a show.
"Ally: What a show, baby."
"Brennan: Tune in.You see that they sort of wander out, but you can tell they remember, somewhere they remember."
"Emily: If I see any of them, I wanna be like,"
"Sofia: Look, I just found out magic is real, too. It's a real fuckin' dick to the face, if you know what I mean."
Siobhan: A dick to the face.
Ally: To the face?
Brennan: Where do you guys gather as the battle--
Zac: Probably in the bodega.
"Kugrash: Yeah, why don't we go to that cool bodega. What's that ring? What's that ring, Sofia?"
"Ally: Yeah, it sounds like there was swords and stuff, right?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, what's up with this mirror that I pocketed?"
"Brennan: You guys leave. You guys see that, as you guys go back, you see that La Gran Gata is there waiting for you in the bodega, going—"
[purring]
"Sofia: La Gran Gata, I pledge myself to you."
La Gran Gata: You pledge yourself to me?
"Sofia: Yeah, do you take pledges?"
"La Gran Gata: I have not in the past, but..."
"Sofia: Well, you got one now."
"La Gran Gata: Mm, your service is honorable. Can I jump up into your arms and you do chin scratchies?"
"Sofia: [about to cry] Oh my God, yes."
"Brennan: You see, vroom, the cat jumps up, snuggles into your shoulder, and goes,"
La Gran Gata: You are a valiant servant. And I like to nuzzle your shirt. You don't mind if I just rub my hairs on it?
"Sofia: La Gran Gato, Gata, you can do whatever you want."
Misty: [whispering] She's gonna fuck that cat.
Kugrash: She is insanely drunk.
Pete: She is gonna fuck that cat.
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys are in the bodega. It's covered in treasures. La Gran Gata looks over, however, and says,"
La Gran Gata: [sniffing] Something is missing from the shelves of the bodega.
"Sofia: Oh, you gave me the ring."
"Misty: Yeah, you gave me this mirror."
"La Gran Gata: No, something else."
[gasping]
Misty: Oh no.
Pete: Fuck.
"Sofia: Oh no, did the cockroach take something?"
"Brennan: You look up and you guys see a shattered piece of glass on the back that was like a display case, an ornate display case, and underneath it, it says, written in gold, ""The Key to the City."""
Pete: In a bodega?
Sofia: Do you think--
La Gran Gata: And what is wrong with a bodega?
"Pete: No, nothing, no, truly nothing, it just--"
La Gran Gata: These stores are the pillars of communities.
"Pete: Totally, I get all my meals—"
"La Gran Gata: You can get a bacon, egg, and cheese and a coffee for like $2.50."
Zac: I Create Water on the small burning parts of it.
[flames sizzling]
Brennan: You start to put out the fires.
"Ricky: Just being careful, just gotta be careful."
"Brennan: You see that the cat's eyes are this beautiful, again, heterochromia of like a blue and green eye."
Sofia: You're really magic. Can I ask you a very selfish favor?
La Gran Gata: Ask away.
Sofia: I want two different color eyes like you. Is that a magic capability?
Misty: That's what you're gonna ask? You drunk bitch.
"Brennan: You see that the cat smiles, reaches up, and says,"
"La Gran Gata: To administer this most powerful of magic, I need to lick your nose."
Sofia: Lick away.
La Gran Gata: The texture of my tongue is very sandpapery. Are you sure it will not discomfort you?
"Sofia: No, anything to get those two different color eyes."
La Gran Gata: [licking]
[purring]
"Pete: She's fucking, she's really making out with that cat."
"Brennan: Now, you see, your eyes are two different colors. You have one brilliant blue and one bright green eye."
"Emily: Oh my God, I'm Bowie."
"Kingston: Hey, I'm sorry, cat. Did you say that the key to the city is gone?"
La Gran Gata: Many treasures are held here at the bodega. Ancient wonders of worlds beyond dreaming. We also have Ho Hos and the entire line of Hostess cake products.
Kingston: Fantastic.
Zac: Can I cast Locate Object?
Brennan: You can.
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: Ricky, you feel the key [ominous music] moving quickly away, across the bridge to Manhattan."
Emily: It can't be any of these guys because they disappeared.
"La Gran Gata: You have much work ahead and I need to take a nap. I'm a very sleepy cat. Good luck, adventurers."
Brennan: And that's where we're gonna stop on this episode of The Unsleeping City.

[RECAP]
"Brennan: The Umbral Arcana is rent here. All of the tears in the Umbral Arcana here are connected to their puppetmaster, Pete. You feel the presence of insects, the buildings are covered in horrifying, gross webs. And you see a horrifying wasp centaur woman. The fist on your golden ring blows bright. Flames streak off of your fist, and you obliterate this bug lady's fucking head."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Zac: I'm looking through the hole and I'm just like,"
Ricky: Awesome.
"Brennan: La Gran Gata looks over, however, and says,"
La Gran Gata: [sniffs] Something's missing from the shelves of the bodega.
"Sofia: Oh no, did the cockroach take something?"
"Brennan: You look up, and you guys see a shattered piece of glass on the back, and underneath it it says, written in gold, “the key to the city”."
Ally: Fuck.
[gasps]
[END RECAP]
[theme music]
"Brennan: Welcome one and all to another episode of, The Unsleeping City. We return to find our intrepid heroes, say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: I love it. Our intrepid heroes are in Astoria, Queens, as the dreaming insect fold, these vermeans, from the realm of Nod are, [sucking] sucked back through the rent that is stitched together and sealed. The magic recedes from Pete. Those of you still in combat mode watch as the insects and bugsters all disappear. You arrive in the Irish pub down the block, still somewhat covered in webs, people sort of leave and walk away. Some of you look worse for wear than others."
Emily: [two peace signs] Just had a fun night.
Ally: I'm trying to get on your level.
"Brennan: You guys all convene in this pub, you begin to hear the noise of people rushing away outside. The Umbral Arcana slowly starts to seep back in, you guys can feel, those of you who are familiar with it. But you see Sofia very injured, and Pete with this kind of wild dream magic receding from his eyes. What do you guys do as you hear the far away sound of distant sirens?"
"Emily: I think I need some calories in me, 'cause I'm a little drunk, so I'm going to see if they have a Guinness."
Ally: I was just going to say I'm getting a Guinness! You are kidding me.
Kingston: It's 10:00 in the morning.
"Kugrash: You're fucked up, you're fucked up."
Ally: We both start pouring Guinness for ourselves.
"Misty: I'll take a Guinness, if you're going to have a Guinness."
"Kingston: Alright, no!"
"Kugrash: Thank you, thank you"
Pete: Do you want one?
"Misty: When I was a child, we didn't even drink water."
Kingston: Stop! Nobody if we're going to do...
Pete: You know what this is? It's like four bagels.
"Kugrash: Shut the fuck up, Pete! No, Pete, what the fuck is going on?"
Kingston: What was that? You caused the bugs?
Lou: I'd like to slap the Guinness out of Pete's hand.
[glass breaking]
Pete: No!
"Kingston: Pete, what the fuck was that?"
"Pete: [getting another drink] Look, man, alright, I'll explain."
Lou: Smack.
[glass breaking]
"Pete: Okay. Look, I don't know how I caused that. Okay? Your guess is as good as mine. And, you know what? I just feel like a..."
Zac: There's a tap?
"Kugrash: Alright. There are police coming, and now we're destroying property."
Zac: I Lay on Hands you for 15.
"Sofia: Oh. Mr. March, okay."
Ricky: Are you okay?
Sofia: Yeah. I’m doing better now.
Ricky: Is anyone else hurt?
"Pete: No, man."
Misty: I'm good. But if you want to [wiggling eyebrows] lay your hands on me.
Kugrash: Should we go to that bodega?
Kingston: Let's go back to the bodega.
"Pete: Absolutely, yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: You guys rush back to the bodega. You see La Gran Gata on the counter perched. She looks over at you and goes,"
La Gran Gata: Ahh. My chosen. You have returned here to the bodega.
Sofia: What do you wish of me? Anything you wish.
Kugrash: She's so goddamn drunk.
Kingston: This is why the Umbral Arcana is so important.
Kugrash: She bent the knee to a cat.
"Sofia: I'm your champion, what do you need?"
"La Gran Gata: I will come to you in my own time. Where you cannot expect. Walk the streets of this New York City. And I will come to you, when it is time for you to fight."
"Sofia: Okay. I'll be waiting, but not in an impatient desperate way."
Brennan: You see the cat leaps up onto your shoulder and nuzzles your face.
"Misty: We'll leave, you can have him."
Kingston: What is happening?
Pete: You'll wait for the cat?
"Sofia: Kitty rubs, kitty rubs, kitty rubs."
[purring]
Brennan: Her tail goes over back.
La Gran Gata: It feels almost too good.
"Brennan: You see, she looks at you and says,"
"La Gran Gata: Mija, know this. You have a special role to play in the times to come. You are not the first woman to turn to a cat when her marriage has fallen apart."
"Sofia: Yes, I know. I'm very aware I'm treading in dangerous territory here. But you're going to be my only cat, so..."
"La Gran Gata: And I will be your only cat, for you have sworn yourself to my service. [whooshing]"
Sofia’s character card changes from “Drunken Master Monk” to “Drunken Master Monk/Hexblade Warlock”.
Brennan: The cat disappears. You guys see that your ring and your little compact seashell mirror gleam with light.
Ally: Cool! I offer you a cigarette.
Siobhan: Look at how many pages!
Emily: I take it.
Zac: Any other cool stuff?
"Brennan: You guys, the bodega at the disappearance of La Gran Gata, has gone back to a more standard, the gold and ancient wonders have sort of disappeared. But you're welcome to search around if you want to search around in the bodega, you can make an investigation check."
Ally: I'll do it.
Murph: Sure.
Ally: 19.
Lou: If we're all doing it.
"Murph: Oh, nat 20!"
[cheering]
Murph: Searching around a non-magical bodega.
Ally: Mine is 20 but not nat.
Lou: I also got a 19.
Ally: Hey!
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
Zac: Do I get advantage on it now?
"Brennan: No, you do not get advantage on Investigate."
Ally: What'd you get?
Zac: 5.
Ally: Aww!
"Emily: Aww, Ricky Matsui!"
Lou: Can I look for something for Ricky?
"Brennan: Yes, you can look for something. I'll say with that nat 20, too, you guys root around."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I got a 15, I can see if I can find something for Mr. March over there. Mr. March, Mr. March!"
"Brennan: You guys find a couple of items here, they're not as gleaming and wondrous as they were when the spirit of the cat was present here in the bodega. You find a couple different things. You find, Kugrash, you are scooting around. By the way, the bodega owner is still here kind of looking at you guys, scooting around looking for stuff. You find an extremely fascinating looking bagel up in the bagel tray. It's an everything bagel. And as you look at the toppings of the everything bagel, it really seems like this bagel has everything that there ever..."
Kugrash: My god.
Emily: Is it the bagel of infinite holding?
Siobhan: You can have lox and lox and lox and it never doesn't fade out.
Ally: You can put whatever you want on it.
"Brennan: I don't think any of you guys have an identify spell, so some of these artifacts are going to be a bit mysterious. But you find an incredibly potent magical bagel."
"Sofia: Well maybe, maybe I'm magical, maybe that's my magic, I put my hand on it to identify it."
"Brennan: Cool, you reach out, do you have access to the Identify spell?"
"Emily, who is reaching her hand out with her eyes closed, shakes her head."
"Brennan: You put your hand out, and it's a fine bagel. You know, it's not like H&H or anything, but..."
"Sofia: I'd eat this one quick, 'cause it's good."
"Pete: Don't eat it man, don't eat it."
"Brennan: Ricky's having a hard time finding anything. You also find something up in the little thing of like, of 10 hour energies, you find something that is labeled 1000 hour energy."
Ally: I need that.
Brennan: It's called 1000 hour energy.
"Kugrash: Ricky, you're the only one I trust not to abuse this."
Pete: Let me just taste it man.
Kugrash: Get out of here.
Pete: Let me just taste it.
"Zac: Put it in my like, little belt pocket."
"Brennan: Kingston, you find a bottle of, over by the laundry detergent, there's something called holy grail laundry detergent."
Lou: Great. Can I take that over the counter and pay for it?
"Brennan: Sure, you see the bodega owner, he goes,"
"Owner: Oh great, that'll be, this, $12.50."
"Kingston: That's a little expensive for detergent. I mean I'm going to pay it, but I'm going to say it."
Owner: It's a premium detergent!
Kingston: Okay. It's premium detergent?
Misty: I got it.
"Kingston: I'm going to pay for it, I mean, it's just, $12 for detergent's a lot, right? I can get Tide for 8."
Owner: It's for 64 loads!
"Kingston: I didn't see that, I didn't see it was 64 loads. Is this HOV?"
Ricky: Hand you five dollars.
"Kingston: No! [slaps his hand] I don't need anybody's money, I can buy it."
Emily: I take it and walk out.
Ally: I hand you $5000 in a wad.
Lou: I slap the shit out of it.
Pete: Goddammit man.
"Brennan: And Pete, you actually find a little holdover from when it was a little bit more golden in here, underneath one of the shelves, you find a chunk of gold, and you think at first it's like a bracelet or something, but then you see it is actually a diamond flecked golden grill for your teeth."
Siobhan: No.
Ally: Image.
"Lou: Oh god, I hate this."
Siobhan: As if you weren’t skanky enough already.
"Pete: I've been warned about cultural appropriation before,"
"Ricky: Wait, Pete. Pete."
Pete: So I will not be wearing this.
Ricky: Might want to rinse that off before you put that in your mouth.
"Pete: I don't know, it doesn't..."
Kugrash: It's fine!
Sofia: Why don't you turn it into a necklace?
Kugrash: I put it in my mouth.
Pete: You look so cool.
"Brennan: You pay for it. You guys suddenly hear, as the sirens approach closer, you hear [blowing], you see Alejandro, Esther, Ana, and Amelia all teleport right outside of the bodega. Alejandro steps in. You see Esther walks out and begins doing something to affect the Umbral Arcana. Ana and Amelia rush over, preparing some kind of enchantment spell as the police close in. Alejandro walks in the bodega, looking at all the carnage and destruction and goes,"
Alejandro: What has happened here?
Kugrash: Pete happened.
Kingston: This motherfucker can't control his shit!
"Pete: No, I was in a dream, and I let these like, bugsters into the real life, but it was a dream, I thought I could just do whatever. I didn't think that it would really happen in real life."
"Alejandro: What part of your situation remains unclear to you? You are the voice of the dreaming realm. Since you have come here, in the past, it is Monday morning. Since Saturday, Santa Claus has been mugged."
Pete puts something on his tongue.
Alejandro: His sled broken. [yelling] Did you just microdose right now?
Pete: No!
Brennan: I'm going to need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Emily: It was a regular dose.
Ally: 19.
"Brennan: You see that Alejandro raises up to try to lift you up off the ground with telekinesis. And instead, you [whooshes] anchor there and everything else in the bodega starts floating around you. Alejandro looks totally surprised by this magical event occurring. Looks back at you. You hear voices in your head, start to go,"
"Voice: He shouldn't get to, he shouldn't, he shouldn't get to tell you what to do, he's just jealous of your power. Let him know what real power feels like."
Brennan: I'm going to need a wild magic surge roll from you.
Ally: 14.
Brennan: Cool. What does Pete do?
"Ally: I really like Alejandro. I think I'm ignoring those voices a little bit. So, I say,"
Pete: Sorry. I'm sorry man. How do I work on this? Also what does this grill do?
Alejandro: Where did you find that?
"Pete: I found it on the ground underneath a shelf, I was flat on the ground in this bodega."
Alejandro: You are...
"Pete: Special. Sorry, I'm so sorry."
Alejandro: You are a voice.
Pete: Brave. Sorry.
"Brennan: He whips his cap off and says,"
Alejandro: Real people's lives are at stake!
"Pete: Okay, okay."
"Alejandro: You are a fool! You are a, why do you not seem to care about the real cost of what these actions are? These beings were released into the real world! People died!"
"Brennan: Pete hears the voices again say,"
"Voice: You owe these people nothing. We can take you away from here. You don't have to be yelled at by these people. What do they know of your life, your pain, your struggle? There's nothing for you here."
Ally: I take more acid to quiet the voices.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me another wild magic roll.
Ally: Great. 18.
"Brennan: Cool. You're keeping the magic down as much as you can. But you can tell that while you're being yelled at, this is stressing you out. And you can feel, while you have control on it, that it's going to keep being a fight while you're here getting yelled at."
Ally: Fuck.
Murph: Can we see kind of what's going on?
Brennan: Anyone make an Arcana check that wants to.
Siobhan: Yeah.
Murph: Okay.
Siobhan: 6.
Murph: 6.
Lou: 12.
Emily: Oh look. A 12!
Brennan: You guys I don't think can fully see what's happening at this moment.
"Ally: Can I like, crack, pop open the door, and say like,"
"Pete: I'm just going to smoke, I'm still listening, Alejandro."
"Zac: I want to try to interrupt, and ask about… Just go up to Esther, and tell her that,"
Ricky: Someone took the key to the city.
"Brennan: She looks and goes,"
"Esther: The key, one of the, Gran Gata's wonders?"
"Sofia: Yeah, they're going across 59th Street bridge."
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Esther: Okay, um, do either of you want to follow them? Or see if you can track them down?"
Ricky: I'll go for it.
"Sofia: Yeah of course, yeah."
"Brennan: Awesome. You guys, were you guys just going to take off, or are you going to let them know that you're going?"
Sofia: You guys want to go chase this key?
"Kugrash: Yeah, I mean..."
Misty: Can we take your bus?
Kingston: You can take my bus.
Brennan: Cool. Now Locate Object has a range of 1000 feet. So I'm going to actually need an investigate check from Ricky to see if you can keep up with this thing as it's going over the bridge.
"Zac: Can I use Find Steed too, and just like, chase after it on my steed? Or is..."
"Brennan: Rad. You may absolutely cast, well first of all, give me the Investigate check to see if you can even locate where this thing is."
Zac: Okay. I got an 18.
"Brennan: 18\. Yeah, you sense it heading over the bridge fast, but you're going to have to hoof it."
Emily: What about pawing it?
Brennan: Cool. Ricky. You're going to need help chasing this thing down. How does Ricky summon his steed?
"Zac: Well I just had become a dog, right? And so I'm feeling this sort of canine energy in me. And I know I have to get over there and I just… So just calling out to the dogs of the world, [howls] Howl."
"Brennan: You reach out and call to these dog spirits. You guys see a flash of morning light. The sun coming up, it is about 10:00 in the morning. And you see running around a corner, this beautiful like, red fire hydrant, golden light. Like time slows down. And the most beautiful dalmatian in the world starts running, [barks]. Begins to rush towards Ricky, and leaps up into your arms. [slurping]"
Zac: I lick it back.
[panting]
Dog: You're my best friend in the whole world.
Ricky: You're my best friend.
"Kingston: Whoa, it can talk?"
"Brennan: Oh, sorry. That's only Ricky hearing that."
Murph: Can I hear it too?
Brennan: You can hear it too.
Murph: Awesome.
Ricky: You're my best friend. I need some help finding something right now.
Dog: Okay.
Ricky: Big old key.
Dog: Big old key.
"Ricky: Can I get on your back, or can I just run with you?"
"Brennan: As you run alongside your dalmatian, you find that your speed greatly increases as you enjoy running alongside your dog."
Zac: I'm just having an incredible time.
Brennan: Incredible time. So Ricky sprints off.
"Murph: I'd like to turn into a dog as well, just a real busted dalmatian though."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Just tongue permanently out,"
"Siobhan: Just like, fucked up from inbreeding."
"Murph: Just like, jaw broken."
Lou: Oh god.
"Brennan: You see that your dog looks over at Kugrash and goes,"
Dog: Something's wrong with that dog.
Murph: He's always got so much saliva.
Kugrash: This is fun guys.
"Brennan: Cool. You guys I think, even with the bus, are probably not going to be hoofing it as fast as Ricky and his dog and Kugrash are. Does anyone else join, or is it Kugrash and Ricky peeling off to go chase them?"
Lou: Can I talk to Alejandro?
"Brennan: Yeah, you see Ana and Amelia kind of handling the cops. Esther and Alejandro both look very kind of serious and downcast as you guys are in the bodega. Also, by the way I will say, as you guys take off, it's 10:00 AM Monday morning. So like, Ricky, your like, shift starts in like, an hour and a half. And Kingston, you… You [Misty] have like rehearsal and stuff coming up."
"Kingston: Yeah, I've got to get to work."
Brennan: You got to get to work.
"Murph: My schedule's open, I’m a rat"
"Brennan: Yeah, Kugrash is always open. And yeah, and Pete, you, you step outside to smoke, so you're like out in front of the bodega. So this is I think, Esther, Sofia, Kingston, and Misty, and Alejandro are all in the bodega still."
"Emily: Yeah, I think if they're safe, I'll just chill in the bodega."
"Brennan: Cool, awesome. Alejandro looks over at you, Kingston."
Alejandro: [sighs] This is very bad.
Kingston: Tell me about it.
Alejandro: I am… Listen. Pete is a troubled young man.
Kingston: Mm-hmm.
Alejandro: He's very very cool.
Kingston: I like the kid a lot.
Alejandro takes a drag from his Juul.
"Kingston: My man, you got to… What flavor?"
"Alejandro: Oh, this is, oh this is melon passion fruit guava."
"Kingston: Why'd I even ask? But you're right, I like the kid, but this is bad stuff."
"Alejandro: [sighs] Perhaps we should, we have plenty of work here, trying to clean up this mess and restore the Umbral Arcana. Maybe it would do for us to meet later tonight. And have a discussion about what is to be done."
Kingston: Got a bunch of leftover salad at my place. If you just want to...
Alejandro: Did that keep?
"Kingston: I mean, it's salad. We can probably get, we can get a day out of salad."
"Sofia: Sorry to interject, I'm pretty sure I was good with the tupperware before we left."
"Kingston: Okay, great."
"Sofia: Sorry, I'm gone."
"Alejandro: Okay. Sure, we can come by and have some salad at your place."
"Misty: You know Alejandro, I think they've discontinued those fruit flavored Juul pods, so, maybe you should stock up on them before they disappear."
"Kingston: Okay, nobody needs to be stocking up on this."
Alejandro: Really?
"Misty: Yeah. Kids were smoking them. They were all like, chocolate banana flavored."
Alejandro: There's a chocolate banana flavor?
Misty: Probably.
Alejandro: Oh. That rules.
Kingston: I'm going to show you pictures of popcorn lung when you come over to my place tonight. I'm going to show you pictures of popcorn lung.
"Alejandro: Kingston, I am 92 years old, a little popcorn lung is not a bad way for me to go out and this tastes so good. You can smoke it inside it's just vapor!"
"Kingston: Okay, you cannot smoke it inside, laws are changing!"
Alejandro smokes his Juul.
"Kingston: Okay, stop, stop."
Lou: I look over at the owner.
"Brennan: A flock of smoke, of vapor pigeons flies out of his mouth."
Lou: Alright.
"Brennan: Wonderful. So, you guys, what's Pete doing outside as he's like, catching up with himself?"
"Ally: I think I'm just kind of like, pacing, and like, angry."
"Brennan: Uh, yeah. Your phone lights up with a little text from Priya."
"Ally: Great. Cool, I read it."
"Brennan: It does not address any of the things in your wall of text to your ex. It says,"
Priya: What's your schedule like today?
Pete: Fuck you.
"Ally: I write back,"
Pete: I'm free before 5:00 pm.
"Brennan: A response back,"
Priya: Splendid. Do you think we could grab a quick cup of coffee? Wanted to talk to you about us.
Ally: I leave it on read for a little while.
Emily: Vicious.
"Brennan: Yeah, wonderful. You also have some like, messages from 53\/3N, you also have like, been sleeping in Kingston's place."
"Ally: Yeah. I really want to check in with my… my like, criminal network, and see if anyone knows who Robert is. Or like, do some investigating instead of meeting up with him."
"Brennan: Awesome, do you want to send those questions over electronic messaging, or do you want to be like, hey, let's meet up and talk, and ask them in person?"
Ally: I want to make a couple stops and ask some people in person.
"Brennan: Cool, so I think Pete you just dip."
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: Pete dips.
Ally: I only look in through the window and say bye to Kingston.
Lou: Nothing.
Emily: Sofia sees this and is really hurt.
"Ally: I feel bad, but I just didn't want to talk to Alejandro again."
"Emily: I look at the cigarette that you gave me and I'm like,"
Sofia: I guess it meant nothing.
Ally: Do I have Sofia's number?
"Brennan: Yes, I think you have Sofia."
"Ally: I text like,"
"Pete: Had to dip, bye Sofia!"
"Sofia: Okay, I instantly feel great."
"Brennan: Incredible. We'll cut over first. An 18 is awesome. So Ricky, you are sprinting at the pace of a full running dog."
Ricky: For the city!
"Brennan: You just like, rip across the 59th Street bridge with the two dalmatians. You've got the gleaming ax in your hand. You rip across the bridge. You manage to keep this. You're like, [sniffs] sniffing out this key yourself. You get a little message from Esther. It actually is like a magical message, not on your phone. She says,"
"Esther: The key to the city is a very powerful magical artifact. Its signature should be easy to read. There are certain pockets in the city that are dead zones, where things are hard to divine or scry. Try to get it before you get to one of those dead zones."
"Brennan: I'm going to need, for these sort of like, running checks, I'm actually going to need Constitution checks from you, and your dog, to like, set the pace and keep up, and from Kugrash as well."
"Zac: Are these like, saving throws or just straight up."
"Brennan: They're actually checks, nothing bad's happened to you. It's about you full speed running after a vehicle trying to catch up with it basically."
Zac: Cool. 11.
Murph: Natural 3.
"Brennan: Okay, go ahead and give me a roll for your steed as well."
Zac: I don't know what I would add to that though.
"Brennan: By the way, what's the name of your wonderful sweet dog?"
"Zac: Oh, um..."
Brennan: You can take a moment to think about it if you want.
"Zac: Yeah, I'll take a second."
"Emily: Oh my god, I can't wait for you to debut it."
Lou: Can't wait for a debut.
"Zac: And then for the mount, I rolled a 15. And do I add my constitution to that?"
"Brennan: You would add, so just plus one."
Zac: Okay so 16 for that.
"Brennan: Cool. Your magical dog, magical dalmatian is keeping up. Kugrash, you have a hard time, your lungs."
[breathes heavily]
Ricky: Come on Kug!
"Kugrash: Fucking so fast kid. Your stupid magic dog. Goddammit. I hate my goddamn life. Why'd I follow you? You're in such good shape, goddammit."
"Ricky: Looking great, it's awesome to exercise, man."
Kugrash: [panting] Fuck you! [groans]
"Brennan: Kugrash, you're hurting. It's a hard time keeping up. Ricky, you could probably keep up with the car but you'd be leaving Kugrash behind."
"Kugrash: It's fine, fuck me, go goddammit!"
Ricky: You sure?
"Kugrash: You stupid kid, go! You goddamn beautiful boy! You fucker! You absolute asshole!"
Ricky: Are you okay?
"Kugrash: Go fuck yourself, Ricky!"
Ricky: Awesome.
"Brennan: Ricky you are just sprinting, [whooshes] just like, the awnings of delis and storefronts and the little umbrellas and hot dog carts like, [whooshes] flutter in the wind as you [grunts] just sprint down the street. Your dog is like [barking] just like, running beside you."
"Zac: Oh, I've decided the dog's name is Ox."
Brennan: Ox.
Emily: Yeah!
Ally: A-U-X?
Emily: Like a cable.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
Ox: Ricky! Ricky this is the best time in the world! You're my best friend!
Ricky: You're my best friend.
Ox: I love to help!
Ricky: You're helping me a ton.
Ally: Aww.
Kugrash: Fuck you!
Brennan: That's incredible.
Emily: Animal control has descended on you.
Brennan: Great.
Lou: Calling 9-1-1 about a strange dog.
"Brennan: I also need you to, weirdly, actually make a Stealth check for me, as you catch up on the vehicle, to see if it doesn't spot you."
Emily: It was a car.
Siobhan: How could nobody spot this hot man and his beautiful dog?
Zac: I rolled a 12.
Brennan: Okay. Going to need to roll back here.
"Siobhan: People are already Instagramming him and he's famous, he's hashtag trending on Twitter."
Brennan: You have disadvantage on stealth.
"Zac: Okay, so. Shit. Okay. So 10. Oh wait no, 7, fuck."
Brennan: Gotcha.
"Siobhan: You have disadvantage on stealth, why?"
"Zac: 'Cause of plate, I guess?"
"Brennan: Ricky has the effect of plate armor, which normally gives you disadvantage on stealth. But we're saying that Ricky's just, doesn't have plate, but has the armor class, and doesn't have the disadvantage, but is too hot. So, it's hard to be stealthy."
"Emily: His like, muscles. He has so much bulk."
Murph: He's got them big thick pants too.
"Ally: That is so funny. Yeah he's already fully trending on like, online."
Brennan: Actually I'm going to say a bunch of people...
"Lou: Have posted Insta, hot guy running!"
"Zac: Are people like, cheering for me?"
Siobhan: Hot guy running with dog.
Emily: Hashtag beauty and the beast.
"Brennan: Like Misty, you're like, on your way out of the bodega and you look at your like, your social media, and there's like an incredible thing of like, ooh, March in December, what's this hashtag? Ooh, Mr. March just runs! Yeah, a lot of incredible things. I'm also going to make a little roll back here real quick. You see that as you're running, Ricky, while you're sprinting down the street, there are a lot of opportunities like, someone's like, baby stroller almost goes out into the street, and you like, [baby crying] push it back against them. Someone like,"
"Bystander: Oh, I'm dropping all these pies!"
Ricky perfectly catches all of the pies.
Bystander: Wow! Thanks Mr. March!
Ricky: Smells great.
"Brennan: Just another perfect day for the luckiest, hottest man in New York. Cool."
"Siobhan: Tom Cruise's characters are all based on him. Just following behind like, how can I do this? How can I make this my next role?"
Brennan: Incredible.
Murph: I barrel through all of these people 15 minutes later.
"Ally: And you ruin everything. You kick the baby, you crush the pies."
Murph: Jump over the baby.
Lou: Giant weight is pushing.
Brennan: Ricky give me one last investigate check.
"Zac: Okay. Come on. Ugh, fuck. What's my investigation? Okay, 5."
"Brennan: 5\. Cool. You rolled a lot of really great rolls in a row. You sprint up down through Manhattan, you get up onto the FDR, going down the East River. Running in between cars. You get all the way down to the financial district. As you get there, your Divine Sense tingles a little bit. You're down on Wall Street, and, it is busy down here, but there is a faint aura of death around this place. Your Locate Object spell goes blank, and [whooshes] kind of disappears. And you see that Ox kind of, [whimpers] huddles up behind your legs, and crouches down."
"Ricky: Come here, come here, come here. [whimpering]"
Brennan: Big dog jumps up in your arms.
Zac: Just looking around holding my dalmatian.
Ally: Like a giant baby.
Siobhan: Everybody in the world has heard of you now.
Ricky: Something's off here.
Siobhan: This beautiful man is holding a huge dog.
"Emily: Ellen is on the phone being like, what are you up to this week?"
"Ally: We need him, we need him."
"Zac: I take a selfie with the dog, and send it to Esther, like,"
"Ricky: Made it to the financial district, something's off here. Smells like death. How are you?"
"Brennan: She responds,"
Esther: Very busy at the moment. Thank you for the update.
"Brennan: You, with that five, lose the car here. But, you do have a sense of the five or six block area where you kind of had line of sight, you're like, couldn't have gotten that far. Couldn't have gotten that far. So there's a couple blocks of buildings where you think it probably landed or could be in this area. And it's the center of like, Wall Street, like, from like, you know, Trinity Place and the church, down like, down Wall Street a couple blocks, down to like, Stone Street, maybe up to like, Gold Street on the other side. There's like this couple block radius. But, these are high rise buildings, and it is like a warren, like a hive here, of different places and buildings and companies and stuff like that."
Zac: Okay.
"Siobhan: Did he ever see the van, or was he just following?"
"Brennan: Never got close enough. I don't think any, none of your investigate checks beat a 20 I don't think."
"Zac: I don't think so, no."
"Brennan: So you never actually got full line of sight to the vehicle, but, you've sensed it with your spell."
Zac: Okay. Well. I guess I start a group text. I don't know if we have one going.
"Siobhan: Pete’s on an Android, so it's all green."
"Pete: I don't fuck with Apple, okay? All you sheeple."
"Ricky: Made it to the financial district, I don't see it any more. There's something wrong here."
"Brennan: Wonderful. And then you get a text from the fire chief, Kevin, being like,"
"Kevin: Hey, Rick, just making sure you're coming in today."
Zac: Oh shit. I just text him back.
Ricky: On my way.
"Zac: And then, just, one last look, and then head out."
Brennan: [barks] You see Ox jumps down and starts walking along beside you. [panting]
"Ricky: Ox. You've been great, and I'll see you soon. You can go be light, I guess?"
"Ox: Okay. If you want me to be light, I can. Do you want me to go be light?"
Ricky: Yes.
[panting]
[screeching]
"Brennan: Spans, and like diffuses into the light."
Ally: Aww.
Zac: I run to the fire station.
Brennan: Cool. You go to the fire station. For those that are leaving the bodega. What are you guys off to go do? Obviously some of you have work.
"Siobhan: I have to go to rehearsal, which I have not been to for..."
"Kingston: Well everybody can get on the bus, and the bus can drop people off wherever they need to be."
Brennan: Cool.
"Kingston: Oh, and by the way. Was talking to Willy last night."
Misty: Hmm.
"Kingston: He said the Lazarus we might be looking for might have something to do with the Statue of Liberty, or something like that. So."
Misty: Goddammit. I'm stupid!
Kingston: What?
"Misty: Emma Lazarus, it's not Lazarus from the bible, it's Emma Lazarus!"
Kingston: Who is that?
Misty: Emma Lazarus wrote the poem.
Kingston: Which poem?
"Misty: The, bring me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to break free."
Kingston: Wow.
"Sofia: If I may interject. Have you guys maybe considered it's both? That maybe they're some kind of, like, I'm saying like,"
Misty: Meta duality of Lazarus references?
Sofia: I'm saying Lazarus arose from the dead. Emma Lazarus is all about immigration. What if they're using the thing to launder the souls to sort of give these souls a second chance in heaven?
Misty: I think it's possible. I'm really worried about anything that wants to break free.
Kingston: Hmm. Well.
Sofia: I just wanted.
"Misty: Emma Lazarus, though, fun. She was a fun lady."
Kingston: Oh I believe it.
Misty: You know? She was fun.
"Brennan: Wonderful. You guys head off to your various places of employ. The only people that, so you guys all go to work. Misty, you arrive at rehearsal. You walk in, Perry looks up to you and goes,"
"Perry: Well! Miss Moore, hello! Excited for you to grace us with your presence. Shall we go ahead and get it started?"
Misty: I'd love to get it started.
"Siobhan: I perfectly fucking word perfect, note perfect."
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and give me a Performance check."
Siobhan: I'll give you a Performance check.
"Murph: Please roll low, please roll low."
"Emily: Oh my god, I want you to roll low too. I'm sorry."
"Siobhan rolls. Murph, seeing it, claps and grins in victory."
"Siobhan: Um… Is this a dexterity performance? No, this is a regular performance check?"
Brennan: This is a regular perform.
Siobhan: I got a 13.
Brennan: A 13!
Murph: She has a plus 10 in performance.
"Siobhan: I have a plus 10 in performance, I did roll a 3."
"Lou: Wow, okay."
Ally: A plus 10.
"Brennan: So, you go through his rehearsal. There's all these people dressed in these like, crazy fairy get ups, it's like this like, high, schmaltzy, Midsummer Night's Dream. Perry goes like,"
"Perry: Alright, from the top people!"
"Brennan: You launch into the song, and, you, how do you navigate through a 13? 'Cause it is not going to be word perfect."
[show tune music]
"Siobhan: I get through the first verse and a half, and then I just start yelling, line? And then I'm like,"
"Misty: The beat is off, there's something off with this. Is this a new pianist? I feel like the beat is off. This is what we're doing, a five, six, seven, eight! This is where we need to be."
"Brennan: You see your piano accompanist, Benjamin, looks up at you and says,"
"Benjamin: I'm so sorry, the beat is off? Someone help me figure this out."
"Brennan: The drummer looks over and says,"
"Drummer: Um, yes, if the beat, if the beat was off, then, I'll do a different, I'll do it differently for you Ms. Moore."
"Misty: Pick it up, pick it up."
Drummer: I will pick it up.
Siobhan: We're singing a very slow ballad.
"Brennan: At the end of rehearsal, you see that Perry comes over you, and says,"
Perry: Misty.
Misty: Darling. Sweetheart. Angel.
Perry: You are a vision. And I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to make sure that...
Misty: The show as a whole? I mean that is your job.
"Perry: No, certainly! I guess what I'm asking is..."
Misty: I just love your vision for this whole play. I just think you're doing a great job.
Perry: Thank you.
Misty: The flowers look wonderful. Bottom's head is so expressive.
"Brennan: You see that Alissa, your assistant, comes up, and goes,"
"Alissa: Um, hi, Ms. Moore, sorry to bother you. I picked up these different leaves of holly, and a couple other things, you wanted some salt, and some other, it's a little silver."
"Misty: Sure, sure, we don't need to do this now."
Alissa: But you wanted me to sort of build some little things.
Misty: I'm having a conversation with my friend here.
Alissa: [jaw dropped] I am so sorry.
"Misty: Just bring them to my apartment, I'll deal with it then."
"Alissa: [whispers] I am so sorry, I'm very so sorry."
"Misty: Yeah, no, I know you're sorry."
Ally: This is so painful.
Alissa: This will never happen again.
"Misty: No, it won't."
"Brennan: She turns around, and just broken, like shambles off. Perry looks over to you and says,"
"Perry: Misty, there is nothing more important to me than your health and wellbeing. So you let me know if you're not feeling up to it."
"Misty: Darling, I've never felt healthier. I mean, look, 800 is the new 20, know what I'm saying? I'm kidding, I'm not that old."
"Perry: I know you're being cheeky. [laughs, a little overblown] What? Ah, alright. Let's take it again."
Brennan: And you get back into rehearsal. And then Kugrash. What are you up to?
"Murph: I get to the financial district way way way after Ricky has left. And it's daytime, right? It's like, kind of early?"
"Brennan: Yeah, it's a Monday morning."
"Murph: I would like to, hopefully my son David is at work. I would like to swing by his house to see if I can't find something."
"Brennan: Wonderful. His house is, he lives way out in Forest Hills. So, you can probably, you scurry out there. You've got nothing else."
Siobhan: Take the ferry.
"Murph: I'll take, yeah."
"Brennan: You scurry out, or take a ferry."
Siobhan: Take the ferry down to Red Hook?
"Brennan: Yeah, so you take the ferry to Red Hook, you get out there however you get there. Go ahead. When you get there, make a little Stealth."
Murph: I would like do Pass Without A Trace on myself.
Brennan: Awesome.
Murph: Oh my god. 32 With pass without trace.
"Brennan: Yeah, I'm going to say, also probably like, you shift into like an actual, like, rat."
"Murph: Yeah, being myself again."
"Brennan: You, do you have, you know rats can fit through any opening their skull can fit through, 'cause they're cartilaginous."
Murph makes rat chittering noises and wiggles creepily.
Emily: Jesus I didn't know that.
[gentle piano music]
"Brennan: You get in under like a door, like through like a rain gutter, like [slurping]. And there's this lovely little house, this is Forest Hills, so these are like, one story houses out here. You're way out in Queens. This is like the kind of Peter Parker kind of neighborhood out here."
Kugrash: Looks like he's done well for himself.
Murph: I start sobbing.
Brennan: You squish through.
Ally: A little rat crying.
"Brennan: You get in. You see your daughter-in-law is home right now, she's working out of her home office. And your grandchildren are not here, they're at school. But you see there, up above the little fireplace, there is a little soccer trophy. And you see there's like a little plaque or something, having to do with someone getting a first place in a science project."
Kugrash: [fist pressed to his mouth] So goddamn proud of this kid. Wish I could talk to him.
"Murph: Then I would like to, I guess see if I can find David's office, see if I can find my old like, financial records, anything like that. Look for stuff about like, Robert, 'cause I'd worked with him before."
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and make an Investigate check for me."
Murph: Oh god. Nat 20!
[cheering]
Brennan: Baby!
Emily: Oh that's a good nat 20.
"Murph: So inspired by my grandchildren's first place, I need to be good at things now."
"Brennan: Incredible. You scoot around. Your son David is a lawyer, who works for financial watchdog groups to basically hunt down and prosecute white collar criminals."
"Kugrash: [a little strained] Mm-hmm, yep, yep, this is good. This is good."
"Brennan: You see that there are a number of files in his sort of home desk office area. And there's a closet with a bunch of those kind of legal files, you know. A lot of legal stuff is still done in paper, and there's a bunch of those cardboard, like legal file boxes, file folders and stuff like that. You see stuff in the back that's been taped up. And you see, it says on it, Bruce Kugrich on it. Which is your name, there's a lot of files on there. You open it up, start to go through your files and everything like that. And you see a lot of financial information here. You go back through a lot of deals. There's a bunch of stuff about your old hedge fund. A lot of stuff about the deals you made. There's some stuff there, you see signatures, like your signatures, you also see signatures from Gabriela Sinclair. As you go further and further through these files, you arrive at deals where you remember something being made with this group that had a long name in it. But, hold on one second."
Murph: Sure.
[typing]
Murph: Sobbing the whole time.
Lou: Just a little rat.
"Ally: Yeah, tiny rat lifting up a file like this. [Ally mimes holding something massive over their head]"
Murph: Stealing from my son.
"Kugrash: I guess technically, this is mine, so it's not stealing, but it feels like stealing."
Emily: Eye boogers getting caught in your fur.
Kugrash: Absolutely fuck me.
Ally: I need another perm.
"Brennan: You find a file with financial information in it, from an old, old money group. The kind of, where, they didn't even like, take meetings, they like, called you, to come in and take meetings with them, right? Called O'Neil, Dwyer, Burns, and Moses. And as you say that, you suddenly remember being at a party back in the 80s, where you saw that guy Robert. And heard someone refer to him out of the corner of your ear as Mr. Moses."
Kugrash: Oh fuck me.
"Brennan: Go ahead and make a, with that nat 20, make a history check, with advantage."
[humming]
Murph: 14.
"Brennan: You suddenly think back. Robert Moses is a figure of New York history. And as you suddenly realize that you never got that guy's first name, and now you got it here from Pete, Robert Moses is a powerful historical figure, within the history of New York. With a 14, you remember that he was not only sort of a businessman, but also had a lot to do with like the civic life of New York. He was part of a lot of, never elected, but was part of a lot of government boards, had a lot to do with the building and infrastructure of New York, specifically, a lot with the building of roads and highways."
Emily: Hmm. Causing interference in the magical world. Highway hex.
"Brennan: You also find in these boxes back here, on top of the last box in this closet, you see there is a little envelope that is closed, but not sealed. And it says, to Dad, on it."
Murph: [groans] I read it. Goddammit.
Brennan: You open this letter up. And start to read it.
[emotional music]
"David: Dear Dad. I don't expect this letter will find you before my funeral. Which I would hope that you had the decency to come back to. I don't know where you are, or why you left. Having raised a family of my own, I can tell you that it takes a lot of bravery to steer kids right in this world. And so I'm not surprised that you couldn't hack it. Because I can't tell it to your face, I'll say it to you here. Thank you. Thank you for showing me the type of person in this world that you need to devote your life to stopping. I've spent my life's work raising kids, being a good husband to my wife, and making sure that people like you who hurt people for profit face consequences for it. I think I've come to terms with what you did to me. I'm strong enough that this is something I won't let stand in the way of a happy and good life for myself. What you did to Wally, I can never forgive, because he needed you. Hope this letter finds you well, and in good health. For all you've done, I still wish you nothing but the best. And know that everybody has a chance to turn their life around. I don't think I'll ever live to see yours, but here's hoping. David."
[sighs deeply]
"Murph: I leave the letter, because I'll remember it."
Siobhan: Jesus Christ. Brutal.
Murph: Fuck me. Was such a goddamn rat.
"Brennan: You finish the letter, put it down, and there's a soft silence as this furry little rat stands in this little closet, full of these financial records and papers. And, you hear a car pulling up into the driveway outside."
Murph: I leave.
"Brennan: You sneak out the back, afraid to see who's probably coming in the front door. We'll go from Kugrash to… We'll head over now to Kingston. Cool, what's going on with Kingston as he gets over to St. Owen's?"
"Lou: I guess I got to get through the day. So I don't know, I think like a, very like a head down kind of day, at work."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You're getting through your day there at work. You see that Emiko is there, she smiles, she says,"
Emiko: You seen this crazy shit on Instagram?
"Kingston: What, what is that?"
Emiko: March in December?
"Brennan: Shows you a bunch of stories of Ricky running and like waving at people and catching like falling… As he like, sprints through the city."
Kingston: That boy is crazy.
Siobhan: Get that boy on The Bachelor.
Lou: I swear.
"Zac: Like, accidentally flexing."
"Brennan: You see her, she looks and says,"
"Emiko: I don't get, it's just all these thirsty women online, and a lot of thirsty men as well. And I don't understand why he won't let me set him up with my fucking friends!"
"Kingston: Is he not, he's not… I presumed he is dating thousands of people."
"Emiko: I don't think so. I also don't know when he would. He works out two hours a day, cardio and resistance. Gets nine hours of sleep, and works a full firefighter job. And then also has this weird hobby. He's part of like a Gramercy, there's something in Gramercy he does."
"Kingston: Oh, cool. Something, cool, and in Gramercy, that's a cool part of town, right, there must be interesting things going down."
Emiko: I guess so.
Kingston: He's not dating anybody.
"Emiko: No, not that I know."
"Kingston: Hey. I mean, people's people."
Emiko: You're not wrong.
Brennan: You get a call on your phone while you're at work. [phone ringing]
Lou: Who is it?
Brennan: An unknown number.
Lou: I pick up.
Epona: Is this Mr. Kingston Brown?
"Kingston: Yes, and who do I have the pleasure of speaking to?"
Epona: This is officer Epona Cirillo.
"Kingston: Oh, what's up Epona?"
"Epona: How's it going, Kingston?"
"Kingston: I'm good, how are you?"
"Epona: Listen, we're working with the DA's office down here. And we're looking to collect testimony from you and we have no way of reaching Kugrash, and we don't have Misty Moore's number on file, but basically, anyone who was a witness to the events of Santa Claus's assault in the park. We'd love you to come down to city hall today if you can, we'd like to get a testimony from you."
"Kingston: You want me to bring everybody, or you want me to just come by myself?"
"Epona: We'll take whoever we can, if you have those other people that were with you, anyone that saw it, we'd love to try to track them down, but we can also collect that information from you down here at city hall."
"Kingston: Okay, great."
Brennan: Cool. What does Kingston do?
Lou: Guess I'll head down to city hall real quick.
"Brennan: Great. You head down to city hall. As you head down there, you walk in, and you see that Epona greets you. City hall, massive building with the golden statue on top, huge stone steps everywhere. Epona leads you up these stone steps, meets you out front,"
"Epona: Ah, Kingston, thanks for coming down, I appreciate it."
"Kingston: Of course, Epona, happy to do my civic duty."
Brennan: She clip clop clip clop clip clops her centaur hooves up the stone steps.
Kingston: Hey does that ever get annoying to you?
Epona: What?
"Kingston: The sound of your own feet? Now listen, I don't know, I don't find it annoying personally, I'm just, like, it's an interesting thing. You know, 'cause when I put on nice shoes, and I hear like the tip tap tip tap, I like that. But I don't wear nice shoes all the time, so it's like, for you, clip clopping all the time. Is it clip clopping, is that offensive? I'm just trying to be respectful."
"Epona: Hey, you know what, I understand."
"Kingston: I'm just trying to understand you better, you know?"
"Epona: For sure. Kingston, I'm going to be honest with you, first of all, I don't have feet I have hooves."
Kingston: Okay my bad.
"Epona: That's alright, I mean, that's okay. Second of all. You know. I mean yes, yes, it's a little annoying. It's a little bit annoying. Because it's a reminder that you know, this, listen, this city is not built for me."
"Kingston: You want something for that? I can probably get a guy to make like a soft shoe, like a soft horseshoe. I'd probably find a guy for that."
"Epona: Yeah, you know, I'm good Kingston, I appreciate that, I really do appreciate that."
"Kingston: You ever want a soft horseshoe, you let me know, okay?"
Siobhan: Fucking Air Jordans for a centaur.
"Epona: I don't know, you know, I don't know what kind of flubber horseshoes you're talking about here, but, these horseshoes are fine."
Kingston: Okay.
"Brennan: You see that she leads you to city hall. As you go in, there's a bunch of metal detectors there. You see that there is, they're gray and kind of those beigey metal detectors. And there's one metal detector at the far end that has a tiny little goblin in like a clerk's uniform that, it's like crazy sparkling lapis lazuli and amethyst, like [crackling]."
Lou: Mm-hmm.
"Clerk: Hey, how's it going?"
"Brennan: So he goes,"
"Clerk: Epona, is this a guest of yours?"
"Brennan: She says,"
Epona: Yeah. We're going into the 17th circuit.
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Clerk: Oh, alright. Right down here."
Brennan: Leads you through.
"Clerk: Sir, are you carrying any firearms, weapons of any kind, flammable liquids, spectral entities, souls, memories, dreams?"
Kingston: None other than my own.
"Clerk: Sometimes people. You stepped on my joke. Sometimes people say, I don't have any, no souls, and I'll go, oh no! Not even your own!"
Kingston laughs extremely aggressively.
"Clerk: This guy's, that's good. Great minds, huh?"
"Kingston: Next time I'll let you have that one, alright?"
"Clerk: There, yeah, don't step on it next time."
"Kingston: Yeah, I won't."
"Brennan: You go through, beep beep. [beeping] And see that you walk through, Epona steps around. She leads you to a small room. And she actually looks at you and says,"
"Epona: As Vox Populi, we don't have to actually swear you in 'cause everything you say is legally speaking, admissible testimony and evidence. However if you would like to be sworn in, we're happy to do that. Is there something you'd like to be sworn in on?"
Lou: Can I take off my eternal coat and give it to her?
"Brennan: You see that she nods. She like, wraps your hand around it and says,"
"Epona: Kingston Brown, offering testimony on behalf of the city of New York. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? To the best of your ability?"
Kingston: Of course.
Epona: Wonderful. We're done but here you go.
"Brennan: She steps into one of those mirror rooms where you see a lineup. You see there is a lineup of a giant, massive, like tree, with a face. Up against the height thing. A weird, like, what looks like a mound of human excrement with eyes and a mouth."
Lou: Like an emoji?
Ally: I was thinking the same thing.
"Brennan: Yeah, it looks a weird, horrifying poop emoji, but its eyes are all yellow and jaundiced and very bloodshot, like it just woke up. And you see there are two extremely tough, tattooed little pixies, and they have like, tattoos, like undershirts, like tanktops. And then saying, the fifth person in the lineup, is a human who just is looking around extremely confused. You see that Epona asks,"
Epona: Mr. Brown. Did you witness any of these individuals within the vicinity of the sleigh when you were adjacent to it?
Kingston: No I did not.
Epona: Okay. Can you point to any of these people that you recognize from personal affairs?
Kingston: I mean. I text sometimes. So I do recognize the excrement with eyes as the poop emoji. At least that's what the kids call it.
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Epona: That's very funny, but, that's just a normal excrement."
Kingston: A normal what?
"Epona: Normal excrement elemental, from the sewers, so."
"Kingston: And that's Kugrash's, not mine."
"Epona: If you can get Kugrash down here, this guy actually asked for a lawyer, and when we offered a public defender, said he wanted Kugrash."
"Kingston: Okay, I'll make sure he knows about that."
Epona: That would be great.
"Kingston: But I do, I was at the Confetti wedding on Sunday. And Don had told me that those two boys, the tough looking pixies, that they were..."
Epona: We should hold this testimony for the DA. If you want to come with me that'd actually be great.
"Kingston: Oh, great."
"Brennan: You walk into a side room. You see that that big thing of shit goes,"
[garbling]
"Brennan: Kug, whatever little device you have is like, blowing up."
Kugrash: Fucking leave me alone you piece of shit!
Murph: I'm going to cry just reading the note again.
"Kugrash: Shit, it's texting me!"
"Brennan: Yeah, I don't know how you have the saved, this is Buddy, is what he asked to be called. But I don't know if you have him saved that way on your phone. Cool."
Siobhan: Feel like you have 18 different buddies in your phone.
Ally: Buddy.
Siobhan: Just call him Buddy man.
Emily: Different numbers of Ys.
Ally: Buddyyyyy.
"Brennan: You walk into a side room, you are seated at a comfortable wooden table, Epona goes,"
"Epona: Hey is there anything you want here? Eat, drink, coffee, you want something else?"
"Kingston: I'll just take a glass of water, a little lime."
Epona: Glass of water.
"Brennan: She walks out to go get a glass of water for you. She walks back in with the glass of water, and right behind her is Liz."
"Kingston: Oh, come on. [scoffs]"
"Brennan: Liz Herrera walks in. She clearly knows who she's going in to talk to, so she has her game face on. She sits down, looks at you."
"Liz: [strong NY accent] Mr. Brown, thank you for coming in today, my name is Liz."
"Kingston: Don't call me. Don't call me Mr. Brown. Okay, okay."
Liz: Are we going to do this?
"Kingston: No, I can do it."
Liz: Are we going to do this?
"Kingston: No, Mr. Brown's ready to talk."
"Liz: I'm at work. So the thing with me here, Kingston, is that I am at work right now."
Kingston: Okay.
"Brennan: You see Epona puts the water down and says,"
Epona: I'm going to fully go.
"Brennan: She steps out. You see that Liz turns a recorder on, and keeps her voice professional, but is just fucking staring daggers at you."
"Liz: So, Kingston. It's my understanding that you attended the wedding of Angela Confetti to, Ronald Pigeon."
"Kingston: Yes, I was on a date with Misty Moore to the Confetti wedding on Sunday."
Brennan: Click.
Liz: Fuck you.
"Kingston: No, fuck you!"
Liz: Fuck you!
Kingston: Fuck you!
Liz: Go fuck yourself!
Kingston: You know I don't want to do this.
Liz: I always knew there was something weird with you and her.
Kingston: It was nothing!
"Liz: She's wanted to fuck you for years, I knew it. You're such a piece of shit."
Kingston: I never fucked her.
Liz: You are such a fucking dog.
"Kingston: Don't even do this, you know."
"Liz: You're telling me you were faithful, voice to the city."
"Kingston: [shouting] I am faithful. I was faithful. I would've continued to be faithful. It wasn't a date. [quieter] I just… I'm… I'm mad, okay? It was, we just… We were going there because there was some stuff going, some business stuff going on, with the whole Santa Claus thing. Yeah. It was business. I don't know why I said it was a date."
"Liz: Business. So what's, the mummy's back or something?"
"Kingston: No, the mummy's not back. Something's going on with Nod."
"Liz: [sighs] Nod. Refresh my memory, that is..."
"Kingston: It's the sixth borough, it's the dream land. It's, I don't know, there's this new kid on the block named Pete, who I guess is the Vox Phantasma. He's me, but for them. Anyway."
Brennan: She clicks the thing back on.
[quiet recorder hum]
"Liz: [signs] So, Mr. Brown. You were attending at the wedding. Did you hear anything amounting to criminal conspiracy, having to do with the assault on Santa Claus in Central Park?"
"Kingston: According to Don Confetti, two pixies had gone downtown, and confessed to being the ones, who, you know, had hijacked, or, you know, vandalized the sled."
Liz: And the names of these individuals are?
Kingston: Pixie and Trixie or something like that. I don't mean to be rude.
"Liz: No, their names are stupid. It’s Twinkle and Pinkie."
"Kingston: There it is, Twinkle and Pinkie, that's what I heard."
"Brennan: Click,"
Liz: And because I have to fucking work in this department now.
Kingston: [face in his hand] Mm-hmm.
Liz: I have to prosecute Twinkle and Pinkie.
Kingston: It's still law. These are still people.
"Liz: It is of, [yelling] I live in a fucking cartoon now!"
"Kingston: You don't live, this not a..."
Liz: Because of you I live in a fucking cartoon!
"Kingston: This is New York City, this is the real thing!"
"Liz: Oh, oh, oh! A horse woman just brought you a cup of water, and these two pixies I got to put away for attacking Santa Claus!"
Kingston: She's a goddamn centaur!
"Liz: I go through I would say half a bottle of whiskey every night, just to get through the day."
Kingston: That is so bad for you. You have to come see me.
Liz: Oh what so you can do your magic hands?
Kingston: I don't want to fight with you.
Liz: I was on track to be the… the district attorney. I was on track to be somebody. And now I'm here. I had to watch them fingerprint a pile of shit. Today. Do you know how unpleasant that is to watch?
"Kingston: I can only imagine. Liz, what do you want me to say, alright? I'm sorry? I'm sorry I fell in love with you, I'm sorry you fell in love with me, I'm sorry we were married, I'm sorry it didn't work out, I'm sorry I brought you onto all of this? What do you want me to say? And please don't call me Mr. Brown."
Brennan: Click.
"Liz: Mr. Brown, thank you very much for your time."
Emily: [whisper] Ice cold.
"Kingston: Great, I'll see you later. Call me if you need anything, and tell that pile of shit I'll get Kugrash down here."
Murph: Our lives suck so bad.
Ally: Oh my god.
Brennan: You can't do a campaign about New York City and have people's lives not be truly fucking miserable. Incredible.
Siobhan: Greatest city in the world!
Brennan: Awesome. We're going to cut over now to Sofia. What does Sofia get up to after the bodega?
"Emily: Okay, well. First off I'm starting to sober up. I think I go to a drug store. I'm trying on some sunglasses. Maybe I'm impulse shopping some Christmas stuff. 'Cause they have, like, you know, a nice display, and… When you are missing something in your life, you try to replace it with material items. Anyways, I text my brother, and I say,"
"Sofia: Mario, I'm heading back to Staten Island. I need to talk to you."
"Brennan: You see he gives a text back and says,"
"Mario: Missed you last night. Sure, let's talk."
"Sofia: Okay. So I think that's my objective. I take my huge bag of Christmas stuff. And then while I'm on the ferry, I also want to try to meditate for the first time. Actually, oh, you know what I also do at the drug store? Are there any self help books?"
Brennan: You start looking at these self help books. Make a perception check for me.
"Emily: Okay. [groans] Okay, 11."
"Brennan: You don't notice it. But you hear a voice behind you go,"
"Voice: [a little raspy, lower] Don't look at all that stuff, that's all fucking trash, you don't need that."
Emily: I turn around. Who's there?
"Brennan: You see a guy with a little shopping cart in his hand. He's like a five foot four, extremely built older guy. You see he's, looks like he's probably in his late 50s, early 60s. Chinese American guy. He's got a Mets windbreaker on. And a little Mets hat. And you see that he has like, very comfy kind of athletic sandals and socks. You see he's got some stuff in there that looks like rash cream and ointment and stuff in his basket."
Emily: I never thought how intimate it is to run into someone at the drug store.
Brennan: But he sees you looking at it.
"Sofia: Oh. Well, you know, honestly, I may look, on the outside, very put together, but, that's because I'm an aesthetician. Truthfully, I want to make some changes, I don't know if that means I need to be like, journaling or like, you know, meditating or something like that, so, I just was interested in a book. It doesn't mean you're a bad person if you turn to self help books."
"Brennan: You see he shrugs and goes,"
"Drugstore Man: I mean, listen. Meditation is, maybe the most important practice one can partake in. Center oneself. Become aware. I get that 100%, it's just that, these books are commerce, they're not real wisdom, you know what I mean?"
Sofia: Then how am I supposed to learn how to meditate? A podcast or what? Get one of those little apps? That's commerce as well.
"Brennan: You see he looks and goes,"
"Drugstore Man: [sigh] Forget it, do what you're going to do. Hey. It is what it is."
Brennan: And you see that he walks.
Drugstore Man: You sound real familiar. Someone recently told me it is what it is.
"Brennan: You see he turns around and looks back to you and says,"
"Drugstore Man: Fuck you talk, fuck you, I didn't talk to you."
"Brennan: You see that a whisper of sparkles appears around him, and over his shoulders that he can't see, La Gran Gata's eyes appear, and wink at you. And he goes,"
"Drugstore Man: Fuck you, what's your fucking problem?"
"Sofia: I don't know, what's your fucking problem? Also what's your fucking name?"
"Jackson: My name's fucking Jackson, what's your fucking name?"
"Sofia: My fucking name's Sofia! Lee, I mean, Sofia, [clears throat] Bicicleta."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Jackson: Why'd you stutter, what'd you say before that?"
"Sofia: I said my, ugh, whatever the, I said my married name, I was married, I was Sofia Lee. I'm not any more. Now I'm the crazy old woman who's got a cat she loves, and is shopping for self help books in a drug store [crying] and I've got a pocket full of Santas that spit up colorful red and green M&Ms!"
Jackson: Jesus Christ. I didn't ask for your whole fucking life story.
Sofia: You asked what's my fucking problem.
"Brennan: You see that he looks at you. He looks at you, and says,"
Jackson: Sofia Lee.
Sofia: Sofia Lee.
Emily: I'm getting into the M&Ms.
"Brennan: You see that he looks at you and says,"
Jackson: You're a fucking mess. The fuck you crying for?
Sofia: I don't know. [wipes a tear]
"Brennan: You have, he says,"
"Sofia: Honestly I didn't sleep well, I didn't sleep at all last night."
"Brennan: You see he looks at you, and puts down his basket, as you go to eat something else, he, lightning fast, you can't even see his hand move, snatches out from in front of your mouth."
"Sofia: Oh my god, I got the sharing size, you could've just asked for some."
"Brennan: He leans back, kicks your basket into the air, and all the candy scatters everywhere and goes,"
[whooshing]
[gong bangs]
"Jackson: [strikes a martial arts pose] Come on, toots."
"Emily: Okay. I fight him. Alright, I take my earrings out, I take my Spanx off, I shimmy out of my Spanx."
Sofia: Let's do this.
"Brennan: You see that he says,"
"Jackson: You fucking get left by some guy, you fucking get a little bit sad, and all of a sudden you got to plow into some chocolate? Have some fucking self respect!"
"Brennan: Pow pow pow pow pow pow pow! And you see he just boxes your fucking ears. Go ahead and give me an attack, give me some attack rolls."
"Emily: Oh my god, I want to fucking do well so bad. [groans] 13 and 27, Nat 20!"
[cheering]
"Brennan: So you see that you, he comes at you. He plows into your sternum, and you straight up lose two ki points. You just, [whooshing], he like..."
Emily: I only had one left for today.
"Brennan: Oh he, [whooshes] robs you of your ki points. [whooshes] As you like, stumble back. See he goes like,"
"Jackson: I don't know who the fuck you are lady, but, let me tell you right now. You got to get your fucking,"
"Brennan: And you, [whooshing] spin, roundhouse kick him, right in the chin, and you see that he skids back about three feet. [cracking] Sets his jaw back in, and he goes,"
"Jackson: That's a nice hit, kid."
"Sofia: Thank you. And I just want you to know that I wasn't kicking to, I wasn't kicking to kill."
Brennan: He says...
Sofia: This was a friendly spar for me.
"Brennan: He looks at you and says,"
"Jackson: Yeah, we'll work on that."
Sofia: Okay. Guess we fucking will.
"Brennan: He looks at you and goes [nodding, grunting] And you see that La Gran Gata appears on your shoulder. And she goes."
"La Gran Gata: Jackson Wei of the Order of the Concrete Fist. This is my chosen, Sofia Lee. Or Sofia Bicicleta."
"Brennan: You see that he looks and goes,"
"Jackson: Yeah. Sofia Lee, huh? Alright. Listen. If you are chosen of the great cat, and you wish to study at the Monastery of the Midnight Sun, learn the secrets of our art. I will accept you as a student, but our monastery is extremely challenging to get to. It lies far away, in a remote place, where only the most dedicated can reach it."
"Sofia: Yeah, I know something about that, I'm from Staten Island."
"Jackson: Oh, we're in Staten Island."
Sofia: Oh!
"Jackson: No, that's what I was referring to."
Sofia: Oh my god!
"Jackson: Yeah, the monastery's in Staten Island."
"Sofia: Oh my god, where? How close are you to Spaghetti's?"
Jackson: We're literally across the street from Spaghetti's!
Sofia: I'm there every other day.
"Jackson: Oh god, that's crazy. Alright. Yeah, that's where the monastery is, it's in Staten Island."
"Sofia: Oh, okay."
"Jackson: Honestly, people think, people usually guess wrong about where the center of kung fu is in..."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Jackson: No, it's Staten Island."
"Sofia: If you listen to Wu Tang, there is a commitment to Staten Island."
Jackson: Can I show you something?
"Brennan: You see he takes his wallet out, and goes through some pictures of his kids, and gets a picture of Method Man and him sparring in the Monastery of the Midnight Sun."
Sofia: Oh my god.
Jackson: He was my best and greatest student.
"Sofia: Yeah, well I'm hoping to give him a run for his money. Honestly."
"Brennan: Oh, he says,"
Jackson: We'll see.
"Sofia: Okay, yeah."
"Brennan: So you see that, so you take the ferry. You see that Jackson goes and gets a little cup of coffee and sits next to you, and goes,"
"Jackson: So, you know. Tell me a little bit about yourself. You have to know you have a gift. Your ki power is incredibly strong."
"Sofia: Thank you. Honestly until recently I did not really understand, I mean I always knew I was like a tough cookie, but I didn't know that maybe that toughness was coming from something magical. I didn't know about, I didn't see anything magical for a while, but recently I've been running with quite a magical crowd, and it's been really helpful for some soul searching."
"Brennan: He says,"
Jackson: You know Kingston Brown?
Sofia: Yeah.
Jackson: Old friend of mine.
"Sofia: Honestly, this is going to drive you crazy but I was just with him."
Jackson: What?
Sofia: Yeah!
"Jackson: Ah, that son of a bitch, tell him to come by and visit, no one ever visits Staten Island."
Sofia: I can't get any of them. I have a huge house and no one will fucking come to it.
Jackson: I have a three bedroom! My oldest went off to college.
Sofia: Yeah!
Jackson: And I'm over here with a spare bedroom. Do I put a gym in there or an office? I don't know.
"Sofia: You think if I have the guest rooms, they'll come stay. They don't."
"Brennan: You arrive in Staten Island, and walk with Jackson, who, you see immediately has like, taken a shine to you. And you keep seeing out of the corner of your eye, never fully manifesting, kind of like spectral or ghostly, La Gran Gata smiling and winking at you."
"Sofia: Jackson, can I tell you. So as you know I am the chosen of La Gran Gata. La Gran Gata loves you."
"Jackson: [touched] Oh. Well, you know, I'll explain a bit what we sort of do is,"
"Brennan: You guys walk up to the ferry and he says,"
"Jackson: So I'm part of the Order of the Concrete Fist. We are dedicated to the defense of New York City, against those things which break through from the other side. We have a number of spiritual practices, and there are spirits like La Gran Gata and others that are actually of the magic of the waking world, of the treasures and splendor and wonder of this place. So, it's very wonderful that the great cat has smiled on me in that way, as she's chosen to smile on you."
Sofia: Yeah.
Brennan: Make an Insight check for me.
Emily: 9.
"Brennan: He gets like a little bit of a sad look in his eye when he looks at you. And you see he just goes,"
"Jackson: Yeah. In any case. I don't think it's an accident that I found you in that drug store, and, I will be very happy to induct you into this monastery."
"Brennan: And you see, as you get into this little place across from Spaghetti's— [to himself] Jesus."
"Murph: Spaghetti's Bakery, was it?"
Brennan: Spaghetti's Bakery. [Italian accent] We bake the best spaghetti! You see the hat—
Siobhan: Staten Island's specialty. Baked spaghetti.
"Brennan: There's a little three story kind of apartment building across from Spaghetti's. You see that he, you get there and you see that there's like a little kind of, a little like, fire hydrant. And you see that there are two metal buckets next to it with one of those like, shoulder yokes. You see he says,"
"Jackson: Alright kid, you ready for your first test?"
"Sofia: I guess so. My only question would be maybe we start with meditation, 'cause I think I could give you, I'm running on empty right now, and I'm willing to continue to run on empty, but if you want I can..."
"Jackson: Yeah, there'll be healing at the top."
"Brennan: You see he points to a fire escape. And you see that the fire escape goes to the third floor, and then you see kind of, you can see that it keeps going up above the top of the building. And as you follow it, the Umbral Arcana fades away. And you see a, it's like a gray overcast day. The fire escape goes up into the sky."
Sofia: Okay. You want me to climb that bitch?
Jackson: I want you to fill these two buckets with water and bring it up to the top.
"Sofia: Okay, yeah. I can do that."
Jackson: I'll see you up there.
Brennan: [whooshing] Jackson jumps straight into the sky.
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
Sofia: I think I'll be able to do that in like a day.
Emily: So I guess I look for a hose.
"Brennan: Yeah, you fill up the two buckets next to this little fire, you can undo the fire hydrant. Fill up the buckets."
Sofia: God. Okay.
"Brennan: And you head off. Pete, we're going to go over to you."
Ally: Alright.
"Brennan: Cool, what are you up to that day?"
"Ally: I think I'm fucking pissed. I think I want to be as intimidating as possible as I just like, walk down the street, and I'm listening to like, fucking, The Prodigy, blasting out of my wireless headphones."
Emily: “I’m a fire starter!”
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Go ahead and make a check for me, about looking over your criminal network, for any like, clues about this...."
"Ally: Oh cool, like, insight?"
"Brennan: Yeah actually. Just do, I think do a flat charisma check for me."
Ally: [to a beat] Ga ga ga ga ga ga ga.
Lou snaps.
Ally: Where is Charisma? 18.
"Brennan: Cool. You begin to like, hustle your criminal contacts. Do you go to see Priya that day?"
"Ally: So I have a plan. I'm going to get a tattoo, 'cause I need to calm down. And I've been wanting to find an eight letter word to go across my fists, and I'm going to do fantasma, across. So that I'm like, freshly tattooed, and I'm just like,"
"Pete: Hey Priya. Oh, weird."
"Brennan: F-A-N-T. F-A-N-T-A-S-M-A? Fuck yeah, very cool."
"Emily: It's not going to look really cool, you're going to have like, bandaged."
"Ally: It's going to look so red and cool, anyway, I'm definitely doing it. So, I'm getting that tattoo, and then I text Priya back like,"
"Pete: Oh, I happen to be in the area of this coffee shop, can you meet up there."
"Ally: And it's like, the one that we had our first date at."
"Brennan: She responds back,"
Priya: Naturally.
"Siobhan: Oh, god this girl's language is infuriating."
"Ally: I hate that I love it. Okay cool, so I'm getting that tattoo and then I… I think I try to hit up my like, the dealers who work with like, Wall Street or like, business people. Like the ones who look very like, suit and tie and can talk to these people and sell them all like, drugs."
"Brennan: Okay, you're looking for like, so like the square, most like, suity people in your network."
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, that might know of Robert or sold around him or something like that and I'm like, getting a fucking sick ass tattoo and bleeding."
Brennan: You get a fucking dope ass tattoo. It's like that crazy playing card font. You know what I mean?
Ally: Exactly.
"Brennan: Yeah, exactly"
"Ally: Exactly, yeah."
Brennan: I get you. I get you.
Ally: Fantasma.
Brennan: Fantasma.
Siobhan: What does the word asma mean? Do you have asthma? Did you misspell the world asthma?
"Ally: No, I don't have asthma, okay? I smoke all the fucking time."
Zac: What's a fant?
"Emily: What are the letters, precisely?"
Ally: F-A-N-T...
"Emily: Oh, okay, so it's with an F."
"Brennan: It's with an F instead of a P-H, that's for sure. So. You arrive at the coffee shop. You started to kind of put your feelers out."
Pete: Ow!
"Brennan: And you see Priya is there. She looks gorgeous, she's in this enormous green army jacket. Her hair's kind of off to one side, beautiful nose piercing. She's got this like, weird little shredded undershirt that has a picture of like a weird cartoon mouse, saying kill me, and paint spattered skinny jeans. You can see she goes,"
Priya: [posh British] [sighs] Peter. You have some new ink on your fingers.
"Pete: Oh yeah, I've been getting some new tattoos. How are you?"
"Priya: You know that phantasma's spelled with a P-H, right?"
"Pete: Oh not this one, no."
"Brennan: You see she nods and says,"
Priya: Would you like some coffee?
Pete: Hmm?
Priya: Would you like some coffee?
"Ally: Yeah, I'll probably get some coffee. How are you, how are you, you look great, how are you doing?"
"Priya: Well, I'm very sleepless at the moment, I have a big gallery showing on the 30th, and, I am just absolutely inundated, as usual, I've said yes to everything when I should have said no, and there's just too much going on. How about you darling?"
"Pete: Yeah, I'm good. Um… Uh…"
Ally: Can I roll Insight to see what's going on here?
"Brennan: Sure, go for it."
"Ally: 11, with… 16"
[humming]
"Brennan: She's a little bit inscrutable. You think that there's like stuff she's sort of not saying. See she goes,"
"Priya: Well listen. I heard through the grapevine that you were homeless at the moment, and I wanted to make sure that everything was alright, because I know that things didn't end well between us, but I still do care about your well being. I want you to be safe."
"Pete: Oh, that's fucking really nice of you. Oh, thanks."
"Ally: I'm like, maybe going to cry, and I'm like,"
Pete: I'm going to go get the coffee really quick.
"Priya: Please take your time, absolutely."
Ally: I get the coffee and I hold all the tears back.
"Brennan: You walk up. You walk up, you go, there's the barista is this like, enormous jacked dude with a handlebar mustache and a neck tat. You see he goes,"
"Barista: Hey man. You want a pour over? And we have a little booth around the corner, do you want to go, do that real quick? I'll cover for you."
"Pete: Wait, what the fuck?"
Barista: Do you need to go cry?
Pete: There's a cry booth?
Barista: Yeah. We're all about it here.
"Pete: That's really nice, but I actually wasn't going to fucking cry, so I'll just take that pour over."
"Brennan: You see he goes like,"
"Barista: Hey. Dog, everyone's relationship to their masculinity is a journey, and I get that. But this right here, fucking kills."
"Pete: What makes you think I'm going to cry, dude?"
"Barista: Dude, my fucking dad died at fucking 67 because he never fucking let it out. And stress clogs your arteries dude, it's a fucking medical condition."
"Pete: Where's the booth, man?"
Brennan: He brings you around to a booth.
Ally: I just let go in the booth. I'm like heaving.
Brennan: He comes over and holds you at a certain point and he starts crying.
"Barista: Fuck, dude. Shit's rough, man."
"Ally: That's fucking insane. Alright I get my pour over, I'm back to Priya, I look great."
"Brennan: She goes,"
Priya: Everything's all right?
Pete: Huh?
Priya: Everything's alright?
"Pete: Yeah, yeah, we, he mistimed the pour over. That's so nice of you. So nice of you to offer. I do actually have a place to live, I have a really good new mentor and friend in my life."
Priya: That's wonderful. I asked you to come here because I had a dream about you.
Pete: Cool.
"Priya: I had this insane dream where I was talking to a man on a giant clock who was like a broken glass man. And I saw you and you were there, and you started to run away, and he was dancing, and, I talked with my therapist about that, and she basically said to me, you are on a clock because the time is now for you to resettle what your relationship to Peter was, because even though it didn't work out, he still means something to you."
"Brennan: And you see that she slides a hand onto your knee, and says,"
"Priya: I think that there might be a role that we have yet to play in each other's lives, and I want to discover what that is, and I want to discover it with you."
Pete: [stammers] I am dating a lot of people.
"Brennan: She says,"
"Priya: No, I don't want to get back together with you."
"Pete: Oh, cool, 'cause again. All the people that I am dating. But yeah to just like, be more in each other's lives. Yeah I'm going to need to think about that."
Priya: Can I ask something? It's just one favor that I want to ask.
Pete: Yeah.
"Priya: Think about it. And can you, I'm nervous about my opening. Would you come to my gallery opening on the 30th, and we can talk about it there?"
"Pete: Sure, yeah, I would love to. Do you have like a flyer or something, or is it like an event, story I can screenshot?"
"Priya: No what's happening is, we actually only have one invitation, and it's being forwarded from person to person. And each time they do, they're going to take a Polaroid of the exchange of the invitation."
"Pete: That's cool, that's really cool. Okay, cool. The art world, it makes sense. And it's very new. It's always new. Oh well that's so great Priya. Yeah, I'll definitely be at your show though. Like I wouldn't miss, ahh! It for the world. Wouldn't miss it for the world."
Priya: Wonderful. I'm going to leave now Peter.
Pete: I was also going to leave.
Priya: Alright.
Pete: Race you.
Priya: I'll let you leave first.
Pete: Hmm?
Priya: You can go.
Pete: So you can watch me go.
"Ally: I like, flex my back."
Brennan: And Pete walks out of the coffee shop.
Emily: We are all such rejects.
Murph: [singing] Everyone’s life sucks.
"Brennan: Cool, couple real quick things. Kingston. As you are leaving city hall to go back to work, Epona comes up to you, and basically says,"
"Epona: Hey, I wanted to talk to you real quick, Kingston, if I could."
Kingston: Yeah.
"Epona: Look. I was wondering if, there were some people with you that I didn't recognize before, there was the firefighter and that young woman."
Kingston: Ricky.
Epona: And that young kid.
Kingston: Uh huh? Pete.
"Epona: Who are these, who are these guys?"
"Kingston: They are new friends, they are all..."
Brennan: Give me an insight check.
Lou: Great. 19
"Brennan: You just think there's just a weird thing where Epona's talking to you outside of city hall while this is happening. And not talking to you in any of the rooms that you were in where stuff was being like, officially recorded. Says like,"
"Epona: Yeah, so this kid, what you said, Ricky, and what was the other name you said?"
"Kingston: Yeah, they're all new people. Would you prefer if we went inside and had a chat about this? It just feels informal, you know, to be talking out here. Seeing as you're an officer and I'm a citizen."
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Epona: No, man, I'm not trying to bust your balls or nothing, I just want to know about the kid, just because, it seems like, you know, if we can collect statements from them, or anything like that. Or honestly if you even tell me where I can find this kid, I'll actually be able to go and just talk to him myself."
"Kingston: Why would you need to do that? I mean, why can't they just come downtown? It just feels like, you know. What can I say, I'm one for, everyone needs to do their civic duty. And they should do it civically. So, you know, I'll just send them down to city hall. How about that?"
"Brennan: She looks at you, nods, and says,"
"Epona: That sounds alright. If you want to give them my information, I'd appreciate that, Kingston."
Kingston: Of course.
"Brennan: And Kingston walks away. We're going to scoot over now to Ricky. You're over at the firehouse. You're hanging out, having a ball."
Zac: Having a great time.
Brennan: Having a great time.
"Emily: Literally playing with balls, you're a dog now."
"Brennan: You're like looking at your phone over like, texts from Esther. And you see, you know, looking at her last messages were very curt. You see that there's three firefighters all named John."
Zac: The Johns.
"Brennan: The Johns, yeah. You see the Johns are all kind of like, lifting weights and one's making a protein smoothie, the other one's doing sit ups. And you see they all look over, and you see one of them goes"
"Johns: [sighs] Hey Rick. What you looking at over there on your phone, man?"
Ricky: Oh I just… Just going and looking at my texts.
"Brennan: You see they all look at each other and go,"
Johns: [frat boy voice] Texts from a girl? Ooh! Come on man!
"Brennan: They're all so jacked. They come over and start shoving you, and they're like,"
Johns: Come on.
"Ricky: Ah, come on, come on."
"Johns: Come on, man. Dude! Come on, like, we were going to go to AC last weekend, and you were like not about it, and like, what's going on, man?"
"Ricky: You know, just… Texting with this girl."
"Brennan: All them pull up chairs and sit them backwards and go like,"
Johns: Talk to me bro. What's she saying?
"Ricky: Well. I think we're just kind of different. And I'm just trying to, you know, find some middle ground, being on the same wavelength."
"Johns: How so? Is she like a different sign than you, incompatible, or are you like, I mean talk to me, like talk to me man, like..."
"Ricky: She's very… She's so smart. And I'm, you know."
Brennan: They all look and nod at each other.
"Ricky: She's more of a learned person, and I'm trying to become a learned person."
"Johns: Bro. I feel that. 'Cause here's the thing man. It's fucking hard in this world for any educated person, let alone, I mean is this, are you talking like she's like, smart, or you mean like, educated, like academic?"
"Ricky: Academic, yeah."
"Brennan: You see that one of the Johns looks at you and goes,"
"Johns: Bro, I'm going to tell you straight right now. That's a hard obstacle to overcome, because a women trying to make it in academia is overcoming so many hurdles and obstacles, and honestly, that is a fucking challenge, bro."
Ricky: Yeah.
Zac: I'm just doing a big fly. [mimes strength training]
"Brennan: You see that one of them is doing one armed pull ups and is just like,"
"Johns: so like, talk to me, like, are you getting a vibe from this chick, or is it like, do you think that she doesn't feel that way about you?"
"Ricky: You know. There are moments when I feel like there's some sort of vibe going on, but overall, she's pretty much about her business, which is something that I really respect. You know."
"Johns: Dude I respect that, I respect that, I respect that too, man, that's so respectable."
"Ricky: Yeah. You know, I'm not really worried about it right now."
"Brennan: You see they all nod and they go,"
"Johns: Honestly dude, that's awesome, because, here's the thing man, like, if you have feelings for somebody, and you feel that you are attracted to them, that attraction is a form of respect. There's something about them that you find beautiful. And if you respect somebody, fuck dude, you have to let them go. Right?"
"Brennan: You see the other one's like [grunts]. You see that the fire chief walks in and goes like,"
Kevin: Who's by the alarm right now? You're all out here working out?
"Johns: Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!"
"Brennan: You guys sort of tumble out of there. You guys start to get little texts back and forth, from Alejandro and Esther being like, we want to have that meeting tonight, as sort of tonight rolls around."
Lou: Salads at my place!
"Brennan: Cool, you guys arrive there. Is Sofia going, or did you want to go talk to Mario?"
"Emily: [whistles] I do want to talk to Mario, but I mean, did I make it to the top of the ladder?"
"Brennan: Yes, you did."
Emily: Yes!
"Brennan: At the top of the ladder, this enormous, awesome monastery in the clouds is there. You see it's all gray. The walls look like they're made of sidewalk material, those big sidewalk squares with like, gum on them. And you see that, you're like, oh, everything here is made of sidewalk or floor. And you see, because it all looks like that, the monks are able to walk on walls, because the walls are, everything here is floor."
Emily: I put my foot to a wall. Can I walk on it?
"Brennan: You can walk on it. Gravity shifts. And you see there's tons of other monks here training who look and smile at you as you walk in. You see that there is this incredible yin and yang symbol up. The yin yang is made of, not black and white though. There is a golden half that is speckled with grime and soot. And there' an incredible like, purple pink blue half with like star energy in it. You see that Jackson looks over at you and goes,"
"Jackson: [sighs] Yep, there it is. The dreaming and the waking world."
Sofia: Ah.
"Jackson: Let's get your training started, kid."
"Brennan: You heal, but, you are healed by your presence in the monastery, but then also just spend a whole day fucking training in all these awesome martial arts."
"Emily: This is too cool, I text Mario and I'm like,"
"Sofia: Rain check. I'm like, it's super pressing that we talk, and it is really important, if you're in Manhattan, please let me know, but for now, rain check."
"Brennan: Cool, you get no response back. Jackson is awesome. The first thing he works with you on, is he gets all the other students to pile into this room, and they start walking like a crowd. He puts a bucket of water on your head, and says,"
"Jackson: Alright. Crowd of people, Penn station. Rush hour. What are you going to do? You gotta get—"
"Sofia: Oh, I can do this."
Brennan: [laughs] And you just do these sprints through a crowd of people with a bucket of...
Emily: Can we say that part of the reason I do it well is 'cause I got really good hip movements? [wiggles]
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"Jackson: [yelling] Great hip movements out there! Your center of gravity's great. Watch your hands, you're sloppy with your hands!"
"Sofia: Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry!"
"Brennan: He says,"
"Jackson: You're always talking with your hands, keep your hands to your side!"
"Sofia: [gesticulating] That's a good point, oh! [snatches her hands back]"
Brennan: And he starts to drill you in this awesome New York kung fu.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You train for the rest of that day. So, Alejandro I think probably calls up Ricky, Kingston, Misty, and Kugrash. But Sofia also heard about it. So if Sofia wants to go, she can go as well."
"Emily: I'm going to deferentially refer to Jackson and say,"
"Sofia: I have an invitation from Kingston to talk some shop. I'm cool to stay here and train. However if you'd prefer me lend my services there, I can also do that."
"Brennan: Hey says,"
"Jackson: Kid. You put in a hard day's work, alright? Go for it."
Ally: Alright.
"Brennan: He says,"
"Jackson: Remember. We'll start working on meditation tomorrow, alright?"
Sofia: I'm going to start doing it on the ferry. I got these really big sunglasses so I can close my eyes and no one will know I'm meditating.
"Brennan: He nods. You head off. You guys get to the meeting place of Alejandro. You see that he looks around at you guys, Esther is there as well. Pete is not here. But he looks at the other five of you, and goes, friends of the Gramercy Occult Society,"
"Alejandro: Thank you for answering this message. Congratulations as well, to Sofia, for being our newest member of The Unsleeping City, and joining the Monastery of the Midnight Sun."
Kingston: Ooh! You running around with Jackson?
"Sofia: Yes, he speaks very highly of you. He was asking for you."
"Kingston: I'm telling you, that man did damage in the 90s. Whew!"
"Brennan: Alejandro looks around and says,"
"Alejandro: The presence of the Vox Phantasma begs a question. There have in the past been Vox… [confused] Phantasmi? Phantasmas, Phantasmus?"
Ricky: Phantasmasas.
Misty: I'm going to say it's an English word and we're going to say Phantasmas.
Alejandro: Thank you.
Misty: It's not a Latin… We're not speaking Latin here.
"Alejandro: No, we are not."
"Misty: Language is mutable, you know, it's a beautiful thing."
"Kingston: Misty, sit down, sit down, you don't need to stand up."
"Brennan: You see that Alejandro looks out and says,"
Alejandro: There is a version of the fight that happened in Astoria that goes a very different way. I want to offer forward the question of what should be done if young Peter loses control of his magic in a way that is even more dangerous than what we have already seen.
"Misty: [signs] I mean, I'm certainly worried about it. I'm wondering actually if your friend Jackson can help, he's such a centered man, focused on meditation."
"Sofia: Jackson was really cool, I'd love to spend more time with him, should I text him? This is a great first reason to text him. Jackson."
"Kingston: I mean, here's the truth, Alejandro. If things get out of hand, we put him down."
"The camera cuts to Ally, who grins and looks over at Lou."
Ricky: What?
Kingston: Straight up.
Kugrash: I think… I have kids. I have kids.
Kingston: What?
"Kugrash: I fucked up. I fucked up raising,"
Kingston: You have rat kids?
"Kugrash: No, you know I was a human, you know I was a human."
Kingston: Oh you have human kids.
"Kugrash: Yes I have human kids. And I've made this mistake before, of overlooking people. And making them angry and bitter, and we need, Pete should be part of this discussion."
"Sofia: You know what? Kug is right. Kug is right because if you mess up someone's hair, you don't just, like if you fry someone's hair dyeing it, you don't just shave their head. You do like a deep conditioning treatment."
Kugrash: Yes.
"Kingston: The problem is we are not talking about hair. We're not talking about your kids. We're talking about the entire population of New York City, now if you're asking me to choose between New York City or Pete? 10 out of 10 times I choose New York City."
"Misty: I am just say, maybe we should consider locking him in some kind of magical cave for eternity? We don't have to kill him."
Sofia: That's the worst one so far.
Kingston: I don't want...
"Brennan: Alejandro goes,"
"Alejandro: Misty, you cannot keep suggesting to lock people in caves."
Misty: It's a useful tool! I'm just saying.
Kingston: You were trying to get us to lock the mummy in a cave for a long time.
"Alejandro: I saw one time when you were at the first Sephora that opened up in New York City, and the person wouldn't let you speak to a manager, and you demanded to lock them in a giant crystal cave."
Misty: Those stores are confusing and I don't know what's good. I need some help. And they don't clean their brushes properly.
"Sofia: Oh, they don't? That's why I was getting pink eye from it. I wanted to know. Just so I can better understand this situation, why would the, is there a reason that the inhabitants of the Vox Phantasma would want to come here, instead? What's wrong with what they've got going on?"
"Brennan: You see Alejandro, he says,"
"Alejandro: When you continue your training you should ask Jackson about that. The Order of the Concrete Fist was created because of the danger represented by the realms of dreaming. It was the response of a waking world constantly besieged by the forces beyond. In dream, things are insubstantial, chimeric and ephemeral. Acts of sudden change and chaos in the realms of dream do not fundamentally alter the nature of that plane. But when raw, pure magic enters forth into the waking world, as often as it creates wonder, or joy, it creates destruction and chaos. It is not fair to the people who have come to this city or been born here and lived here their entire lives, that their well being, safety, and in fact, even their life or death should be thrown into chaos, because of what amounts to often a joke. The spirits of dreaming are frenzied and wild, and you can even see from Peter, the sense of weight or gravity of his actions escapes him. When a Vox Phantasma comes to New York, in the case of Josefina Gatsby, which you knew."
"Misty: Oh, so fun."
"Alejandro: She manifested dreaming through delight and wonder and whimsy. Peter actively courts the darkness more than the light. And the realm of dream has much in the way of destruction to offer. If Peter treads his path recklessly, he could become something far more dangerous than we have the capacity to handle."
"Sofia: Okay, so we just replace all his drugs with Tic Tacs. Right?"
Misty: I mean I think that's obvious.
Kugrash: We're giving Pete something to rebel against.
Misty: We're having a meeting without him.
"Kingston: Well okay, but we need, okay."
Sofia: Let's get Pete.
"Kingston: No, you need to, no! Hold on. Y'all need to slow down, alright? Because I get it. I get that you feel that Pete is being left out and thus he thinks he needs to rebel. He is already rebelling without that. So we do need to have this meeting, we do need to have this space, because we need to decide how we are acting towards him."
"Misty: Yeah I'm a big fan of mischief, obviously, personally myself, but there's a difference between mischief and danger. I do need this city to be stable enough for..."
Sofia: For your show to come out.
"Misty: Honestly, for theater to happen, because otherwise I can't live."
Sofia: 'Cause there's not a lot of art during uncertain times.
Misty: Truly.
Ricky: I'm all for keeping New York safe. But that includes Pete in my mind.
"Misty: Again. Just a magical cave, we can make it a nice cave."
Esther: Alright.
"Brennan: You can see that Esther looks up, and looks at you Kingston and goes,"
"Esther: I agree with Kingston. When Kingston speaks he speaks for the people of this city, and I think Pete is a swell guy. I've also seen him multiple times attempt to sell drugs to children. And… We would be really foolish not to acknowledge the danger. Why don't we let Alejandro hit the books? I will as well. And we can see if there… I'm not saying crystal cave. But I'm saying some magical remedies to our situation. Maybe something that can at least lessen Pete's level of power while he's learning about himself."
"Sofia: Can I just interject? Because I'm in a somewhat similar situation to Pete here, which is that this is all very new to me, and it's all very overwhelming. So magic feels really old hat and normal to you guys, but to him, he's barely just beginning to grasp it. So it's not the same as like, mishandling magic that he's known all his life, it's mishandling magic that he learned about a couple days ago. So I think that there's got to be more of a grace window, for someone."
Brennan: Alejandro. Make a Persuasion check with advantage.
Emily: Okay. 18.
"Brennan: Alejandro takes the little jewel out of his jacket and looks at it and you see his eyes water up a little bit and he says,"
"Alejandro: Sofia, I think you are absolutely right. There is research to be done. Pete has only known of his powers for a few days. I would ask that we keep these a secret from him for the time being. All of us are very busy. You have your training. You have your ward over the city. The rest of you of course have your own duties and responsibilities to attend to. We will be in touch in a few days time."
"Misty: All I'm saying is Merlin, after a couple of hundred years, was happier."
"Alejandro: [yelling, wild gesticulating] I cannot hear about this crystal cave one more time!"
"Brennan: You see that [laughs], you guys head off. A few days of downtime pass. You're training. All you guys were plenty busy before the weekend from hell. Pete. You in your searches a couple days after that. You get a call from one of your suit buddies, saying,"
Suit Buddy: Know where the guy's going to be.
"Ally: I'm talking to him, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you're talking to him."
"Ally: Okay, uh..."
"Brennan: He's like,"
"Suit Buddy: Hey man, if you're looking for Robert, if you even want to get a beat on him, or you want to talk to him, I know where he's going to be."
Ally: I have a card with his address on it. Is this the same address?
"Brennan: The guys says,"
"Suit Buddy: Yeah, you could probably also spot him there if you wanted to."
"Pete: Okay, where's he going to be?"
"Suit Buddy: He's like, a party up in Hell's Kitchen."
Pete: Cool. Nice. What's he like? Like what's his...
Brennan: You see he says...
Pete: Who is he?
"Brennan: He says,"
"Suit Buddy: A big finance guy. Old, old power behind the throne in Wall Street circles."
"Pete: But is he known for anything, is he like, brutal, does he have..."
"Brennan: You see he says, he's like,"
"Suit Buddy: No, he's not brutal, he's a smooth operator, and a pretty easy guy to talk to, actually."
Pete: Hmm. Fucker. Okay. [laughs] Thanks man.
"Brennan: Cool. So Pete has this info on this dude, what's Pete going to do?"
Ally: Can I try to talk to Alejandro's daughters?
"Brennan: Sure, you can text them."
"Ally: Cool. I'm like,"
"Pete: Hey. Your dad, I hate it when men yell at me. Can I talk to you?"
"Brennan: You see they both, they both text you back in this group chain, and one of them sends a gif of someone rolling over laughing. And another one sends something of a very old man falling over in a walker with “fail” under it. And you see one of them says,"
"Ana and Amelia: G-pa sucks, what up?"
"Ally: Yeah, okay cool, I try to meet up with them, because I have a bunch of questions."
"Brennan: Cool. You meet up with them. You meet up on a corner. You see, yeah, they arrive and meet you on a street corner."
"Pete: Okay. Do you guys know anything about Vox Phantasma, or like, what's going on, or..."
"Ana and Amelia: We can like, look stuff up if you want."
"Brennan: One of them looks over and says,"
Ana and Amelia: Yeah. Grandpa's super pissed. I… I would probably not hang out with him much in the future.
Pete: What do you mean? He doesn't calm down? It's been like a week.
"Brennan: You see they say,"
"Ana and Amelia: Look, Pete. We think you're awesome. And just like, be careful, okay?"
Pete: What? Why?
Ana and Amelia: The Society has to come first.
[whooshing]
Brennan: They vanish. Make a Perception check for me.
Ally: Okay. Nat 20.
Siobhan: Jesus.
"Brennan: There is a car idling, a black town car idling at the street corner. And you see that its doors unlock."
[clicking]
Ally: I walk towards it.
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Brennan: A door, back door opens up."
"Ally: I mean I don't get in. I like, kind of have my gun."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
"Ally: And I'm like,"
Pete: What's up?
"Brennan: You hear a voice from inside go,"
"Robert: [sighs] Friends let you down, huh, kid?"
"Ally: I say,"
Pete: Who are you?
Robert: My name is Robert Moses. Do you want to figure it out? Why don't you hop in? We'll take a ride.
"Ally: I say,"
Pete: Fuck you!
Ally: And I run.
Pete: I'm sick of all these men in my life!
Ally: I don't have a home to go to. I think I go to an Equinox for a free trial.
"Brennan: You start, as you start to run, you see that he gets out of the backseat of the car, and stands, and you see he says,"
"Robert: I like to talk in a town car, but,"
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Robert: If that makes you uncomfortable, I'd be happy to talk somewhere else. You have been running me down through your criminal network, so I thought you'd like the opportunity to speak."
"Pete: I know everything. Alright, you can come to this Equinox too."
Brennan: He starts walking with you down the street.
Emily: Get on the ellipticals!
Siobhan: Get a date and peanut butter smoothie.
"Brennan: He's just walking with you down the street. You see he starts walking and goes,"
Robert: While we're heading to Equinox.
"Brennan: He says,"
Robert: You want a cubano my friend?
"Pete: Uh, yeah,"
"Ally: I take it. Can I like, check it?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it, yeah, check it."
Ally: 8.
Brennan: Seems fine to you.
Ally: Alright.
"Brennan: You see that he says, here you go. And takes an old match case out and lights up a match [match igniting] and holds it to light the cigar. He walks along with you and goes,"
"Robert: Well… I want to apologize, I think we got off on the wrong foot."
Pete: How did you know that thing about my dad?
"Robert: I make it my business to know these things, and I don't know if this is going to catch you off guard. But you're not the most subtle Vox Phantasma there's ever been."
"Pete: What. Okay, I have a lot of questions. What happened with my dad? Did I cause that?"
"Robert: In a sense, yeah, you did."
Pete: Hmm.
"Robert: You… You got fucked, kid. I'm sorry."
Pete: What do you mean?
Robert: Well. Did you sign up for this Vox Phantasma job? Did you weigh the health benefits? Did you get a choice in the matter?
Pete: No.
Robert: No.
Pete: Does it suck to be the Vox Phantasma?
Robert: What do you think? You're homeless. You've got a bunch of problems.
Pete: That's just New York.
"Brennan: You see that he holds up a camera, and plays something on his phone and shows it to you. You see a security cam footage from the Gramercy Occult Society, and see Kingston talking about killing you."
"Siobhan: Oh, fuck."
Brennan: And you see Alejandro and Esther weighing that option.
"Kingston: If things get out of hand, we put him down. We're talking about—"
Pete: That's not real.
Kingston: the entire population of New York City.
"Pete: No, that's not real."
"Robert: Your call, kid."
Kingston: You're asking me to choose between New York City.
Ally: No. I text Kingston.
"Pete: Hey, what up?"
"Kingston: What's going on, Pete?"
"Brennan: He walks with you a little while. You see that he goes,"
Robert: Texting Kingston Brown? Why?
"Pete: How do you know everything? Goddammit. Alright. He's my friend, man. That must have been out of context or something like that."
"Brennan: You see that he turns around. You are suddenly standing sort of outside this like, very big looking sort of like nightclub place. You see that he goes,"
"Robert: Well, as another Vox, you should know, Kingston Brown's the biggest schmuck there ever was."
Pete: You're a Vox also?
"Robert: No, hell no. I don't do a job unless I'm getting paid."
Pete: I'm not getting paid for this?
"Robert: No, you're not."
Pete: Goddammit.
"Robert: Look, kiddo, you're a businessman, I get you, you're an entrepreneur."
Pete: Yeah I am.
"Brennan: You see that he opens this door and walks into this nightclub, and you see it is filled with vampires. And there are a bunch of humans everywhere who are like, having their blood drunk around you. And you see that he looks and says,"
"Robert: You get it, right? They think you're some kind of threat or something like that. Everybody here chose to be here. All these humans—"
"Brennan: You see people again, looking like haunted and empty."
Robert: They all want to be here.
"Pete: What are you doing, what's happening with them?"
"Robert: Well, they need money. These vampires need blood."
Pete: So they're selling their blood to these vampires?
Robert: Look. You get it. I didn't create the demand. People did.
"Ally: Um, fuck. So pissed. I text the group, the nightclub that we're at."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: And the address.
"Brennan: You see as he walks through with you, he looks and says,"
"Robert: There's nothing wrong with you using these powers for yourself, you don't owe anything to anybody, alright? This city is the gateway to the American Dream, kid. Rags to riches, making something of yourself, that's your story, that's my story too. It's that little gray kid. They put this curse on you. It's this little gray kid that made you this thing, against your will."
"Pete: What, why me, and who's the baby?"
Robert: Nod.
Pete: Yeah.
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: You see that he walks in a little bit further. And… He says,"
"Robert: So. Here's what I'm thinking. You want to make money. I want to take care of my business and protect my interests. So. Why don't both of us do each other a favor, and talk to this little gray kid and see what the story is?"
Pete: Is the gray kid here?
"Robert: Could be. I can't get the gray kid to come here, but you're the Vox Phantasma."
Ally: Goddammit. I look at my phone to see if there are any texts from any of the crew.
"Murph: I would like to text saying I'm on my way, yeah."
"Emily: I don't have anything else going on, I was standing in front of the mailbox trying to open it."
"Ally: Yeah, a lot of people have been hitting me back that they're interested so I'm going to be like,"
"Pete: That sounds really interesting, I'm going to think on it, and get a cocktail across the street at my favorite bar."
"Brennan: He nods. And as you turn around, you see that there's a large mirror in the nightclub."
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Brennan: You see in the mirror as you turn to look, you see that you have no reflection, and where your reflection should be, is Nod. Who looks around and goes [gasps]. You see Robert raises his hand, a seam opens in his wrist, and a rope of blood shoots out of his arm around the child, and he rips the child out of the mirror as it skids onto the floor in front of you."
"Ally: Okay, I point True Strike at Robert, so hopefully that will activate next turn, and I like, lunge to grab the baby as like, my own."
Brennan: What is the emotion you're feeling towards the baby?
Ally: Protection. Full protection.
"Brennan: You grab it, roll for wild magic surge."
"Brennan: 2\. You go, hold on a second."
Ally: [covering their face] Fuck.
"Zac: Wait, 2 is—?"
Ally: I've already done so many.
Siobhan: Every time they roll.
"Brennan: You grab the child. You see that Nod immediately, its skin starts to like, crack, as it is pulled out of the dream world. [gasps] It starts to die, and you glow with every color that has ever been. You fill the nightclub, incinerate about 20 vampires around you, and Robert is flung backwards, fwoom! You see that Nod looks at you and goes,"
Nod: I knew I chose right.
Brennan: And kisses your cheek. And you teleport away.
Siobhan: What?
Brennan: And you are standing in the Lorimer Street subway stop.
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Brennan: Far the fuck away from that bad place. Your wild magic surges, and Nod is dying in your arms."
Ally: Fuck!
"Brennan: But still alive. You have service here, if you need to text these guys."
"Ally: Okay, I retext,"
Pete: Now I'm at the Lorimer. Like this is an emergency.
Kingston: We got to turn around!
Murph: I turn into the fastest animal I can.
Siobhan: So far away.
Emily: I try to get the ferry driver to make a detour.
Ally: You’re on the ferry?
"Brennan: You guys all descend on the Lorimer stop, it's from all the corners of the city. You [panting] hoof it there as fast as you can."
Siobhan: Are we on the G stop or the L stop on the Lorimer?
"Brennan: You well, you are on the L. [realizes suddenly] Oh, the L stop on the Lorimer!"
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: Yes. What does Misty say as, do any of you text each other after that to text being on that stop?"
Kingston: G stop or L stop?
Misty: G stop or L stop? Am I going left or right as I come down the stairs?
"Brennan: You get a text from Alejandro saying,"
"Alejandro: L stop, L stop!"
Brennan: Do you mention that you have Nod?
Misty: Brooklyn bound or Canarsie bound or Manhattan bound?
"Brennan: You remember, well Misty, you remember, the L train, Canarsie bound,"
Siobhan: Goes to the...
Brennan: Goes to dream.
Siobhan: Sleeping City. Goes to Dreamland.
"Brennan: Goes to Dreamland. So, probably Canarsie bound, or Nod bound."
"Siobhan: Yeah, let's do it, let's go to Nod."
"Brennan: Alejandro also on his way. Does anybody, do you guys call anybody else or no?"
Emily: I think I tell Jackson.
"Brennan: You tell Jackson, cool."
Zac: I probably text Esther about it.
Brennan: Esther as well.
"Emily: I tell Jackson I probably also like, in my heart I'm like, La Gran Gata, just 'cause I feel like you should know what's going on, but you don't have to come, I know you're busy, but, shit's going down."
"Brennan: You guys all arrive. You get to the L train, you see Pete standing there, holding this gray child that's like, skin is like starting to crack and wheezing with breath. You also see that… So yeah, you all arrive there on the train platform together."
"Kugrash: Pete, what happened?"
Pete: Okay.
Murph: Cure Wounds on the baby.
Brennan: Cool. You cast Cure Wounds on the baby. [gasps] See some of the damage is starting to be healed.
Ally: Fuck!
"Brennan: Alejandro is there as well and he says,"
"Alejandro: Okay. Listen, it's a Friday night. So, it's hard to tell when the train. 'Cause that particular train to Nod is a little bit tricky, the MTA, the fucking MTA!"
"Misty: God, we've got to be in the front two carriages and then move to the back two carriages, after we get to Canarsie, but we've got to be the front two at the beginning."
"Brennan: Alejandro says,"
"Alejandro: Okay. I'm going to summon all of my power,"
Brennan: His eye goes gold.
Alejandro: We must make the MTA run.
Brennan: Clocks appear all around him.
Alejandro: On time for once! [whooshing]
"Brennan: You hear another voice. Hear a voice, clip clop clip clop clip clop clip clop clip clop clip clop. Epona shows up. She looks up and says,"
"Epona: Oh my god, is everything alright?"
"Sofia: Honestly, I don't know what the fuck is going on."
"Kingston: No, not at all."
Zac: Can I do a Perception check on Epona?
Siobhan: Yeah I would like to do that too.
Zac: Perception I can do twice?
"Brennan: Yeah, do twice."
Emily: I got a 17.
Zac: Oh god.
Siobhan: 11.
Lou: Perception?
Brennan: Yah.
Lou: I got a 29.
"Brennan: You see that her police badge is replaced by a different badge than you've ever seen before. It is a shimmering onyx badge, and it is specifically crooked. Zigzags woven into the pattern of the badge."
Kingston: Epona? What are you doing here? 'Cause clearly it's not police business.
"Misty: This is bad, right?"
Kingston: This is very bad.
"Misty: Epona,"
Siobhan: And I cast Suggestion.
"Misty: Wouldn't it be great, I heard there's some shenanigans going on downtown."
"Brennan: You see that as you start to cast the spell, the spell is [whooshes] sucked into the badge and steam begins to coalesce and form out of the subway."
Siobhan: That's bad.
"Brennan: You see as she looks and says,"
"Epona: Problem is Kingston, I am here on police business."
"Siobhan: Oh, fuck."
Brennan: I'm going to need all of you to roll initiative.
"Siobhan: Fuck, fuck, fuck."
"Brennan: That's all for this episode of The Unsleeping City! Tune in next week, as we have a little rumble in the subway. Hope the trains run on time, see you then, bye!"
Ally: Fuck!

[RECAP]
"Pete: I don't know how I caused that, okay? Your guess is as good as mine."
Brennan: La Gran Gata appears on your shoulder.
La Gran Gata: This is my chosen.
Alejandro: Peter actively courts the darkness more than the light.
"Kingston: If things get out of hand, we put him down."
"Ally: I like, lunge to grab the baby."
Brennan: You glow with every color that has ever been and Robert is flung backwards and you teleport away. You are standing in the Lorimer Street subway stop.
Ally: Fuck.
Brennan: And Nod is dying in your arms.
Ally: Fuck.
Kingston: Epona? What are you doing here? 'Cause clearly it's not police business.
"Epona: The problem is Kingston, I am here on police business."
[END RECAP]
[dark music]
"Brennan: Welcome one and all as we return to The Unsleeping City. We are here at the Lorimer L train stop with our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
All: Hi intrepid heroes.
"Siobhan: I used to live a block and a half away from this so,"
Emily: I know I --
Brennan: I did too.
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, we lived, Brennan took over my room."
"Brennan: I took over your room, yep."
"Emily: This is, what is it, alligator pizza? Crocodile Lounge?"
"Brennan: Oh, it's right, yeah it's--"
"Siobhan: Oh, yeah, it's right--"
Emily: it's Lorimer.
"Brennan: This stop is, although it's crazy with the rush hour going from the G to the L, it's nuts."
Brennan stops talking for a beat.
"Brennan: [tense music, growling voice] The battle begins. [laughing] We see our intrepid heroes here gathered facing down Officer Epona Cirillo. You are here with Alejandro and in the arms of Pete is Nod the Monarch of Dreams. Also, Ox, the dalmatian appears next to Ricky Matsui. You see steam and smoke echoing forth from the cracks of the subway, Alejandro is casting an incredibly powerful concentration spell. Appearing to summon the train to Nod. Summon the train to Dream, because Nod the Monarch of Dream is dying here in the waking world. You see that he is actively trying to hold onto that spell, it is incredibly powerful. No active magic could be stronger than making the MTA run on a timely schedule. It is combat, Kugrash, you are the first to act."
Murph: Can I do a little Insight check right off the bat to see if Alejandro's surprised that our police officer friend showed up?
"Brennan: Give me an insight check, yep."
"Murph: 'Cause, um. 17."
"Brennan: You see Alejandro looks mostly focused on his spell. He seems shocked that Epona is doing this. You guys have known Epona for a while, she's been on the force for a couple of years now. But, you know, you guys didn't really know her during your adventuring days. She's too young. But he seems shocked that she's doing this."
"Murph: Okay,"
"Kugrash: All right. I trust him. Sorry that you didn't know about the thoughts I had in my head Alejandro but you're good, you're a good guy keep concentrating, concentrate bud. I'm gonna summon the power of the juicy cockroach. I need the juiciest mother fucker that has ever sucked on some fucking garbage in some shit-hole house apartment."
"Emily: Wow, yeah."
Lou: What is about to come out?
Zac: Sucked on some—
Brennan pulls out a massive juicy cockroach mini.
[cheering]
"Brennan: Go ahead, where do you want that to be man?"
Murph: Just like right around Misty. I wanna give us all the temp HP.
"Lou: Oh, God."
[all make sounds of excitement]
"Murph: Oh, it's 11 now."
[cheering]
"Brennan: By the way, that cockroach is spectral. You see it appears, he goes,"
"Cockroach: [high, squeaky little voice] All right, look it's Kugrash. we gotta help this guy fight. Everyone be real strong like a cockroach is."
"Emily: I feel inspired, yeah."
Kugrash: This dude sucks shit and he rules.
"Murph: And in addition to that I am going to call upon my people, the rats. And, use my action 'cause that was a bonus action to summon four rat swarms."
"Emily: Kugrash is in his element, this is his place."
"Lou: We're underground, baby, yeah."
Siobhan: This station is actually pretty clean as subway stations go.
"Emily: Yeah, you're right. Oh, there is one little splotch but there's no vomit."
"Brennan: Kugrash, you feel your power surging. We have been fighting some places that are not your realm. This is the subway, this is the center of--"
"Kugrash: I own this shit, you fucking asshole. You walk around in your hooves?"
Emily: That's true.
Brennan: Do you want these all around Epona?
"Murph: I would, can I do two, let me do two around Epona. And I actually, and tell me if I can do this, I'd kind of like to set up a little barrier around Pete."
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: 'Cause I want to make sure nobody gets the baby.
"Brennan: So, like there?"
"Murph: Yeah, I want them to like hold reactions to jump forward if,"
Brennan: If anything tries to fuck with--
Murph: If anything starts to fuck with the baby.
Emily: With gray baby.
Murph: With gray baby.
Ally: Gray Baby.
"Brennan: Um, hell yeah."
"Murph: And I guess I would like to use my movement as well to go where the cockroach is, to get like, up in the middle between--"
"Brennan: Gotcha, cool cool cool. Okay, this cockroach right here. And these two you want next to Epona?"
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool. Like here in front or?
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool.
"Kugrash: We're all willing to die, right rats?"
[royal music]
"Rats: We serve at the pleasure of the rat king. Let our deaths be a monument to his glory. Build your city right on our bones, majestic one."
Kugrash: Our lives suck ass anyway.
Rats: We prefer death.
Brennan: [laughing] So filth roils around Kugrash as this cockroach appears and rats scurry from all corners of the subway.
"Rats: To arms, to arms."
"Brennan: Pete, that is gonna be your, and the rats—"
Murph: Roll an initiative.
Brennan: Roll their own initiative.
"Murph: 11, or no, 9, sorry."
"Brennan: 9, gotcha."
"Murph: And they have magic, because I'm a mighty summoner as a Shepherd Druid, they have 2 extra hit points per hit dice."
"Brennan: Hell, yeah. Dope."
Murph: Those don't say they're hit dice.
Emily: Those rats are jacked.
Murph: I would say they're probably like level two so maybe they get four extra hit points.
"Brennan: Cool. Wonderful, that is going to be Pete."
Ally: Okay. If I'm using like Mind Link or something does that count as my action?
"Brennan: Mind Link? I believe Mind Link is an action, yes."
"Ally: Okay, cool. I'm gonna go back, kind of like, now the rats are in front of me, just move back like two squares if you guys don't mind, thank you. And I'm gonna--"
"Brennan: Sorry, that's a bonus action. Mind link is a bonus action."
"Ally: Oh, sick sick, okay."
Murph: Sweet.
Ally: Cool. So I'm gonna move back. I'm gonna cast Fireball on Epona.
"Murph: Oh, hell yeah."
Emily: Shit. so that--
Murph: Goodbye rats.
Siobhan: Instantly fuck her up.
"Ally: Oh, and the rats, oh no."
Murph: It's fine.
"Ally: I can, it's a 20 foot radius so I can put it back."
"Murph: You can move it back a little bit, that's cool."
Brennan pulls out the big plastic Fireball range ring again.
Ally: Oh!
Brennan: If you wanna—
Siobhan: This whole stairs.
Brennan: Hit the stairs and catch her in the edge—
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: You can absolutely do that—
Ally: That's what I wanna do. I'm gonna ruin the stairs.
Emily: Oh my God. The commuters.
Siobhan: They just wanna go to Union Pool.
"Ally: Okay, so this is a Dex saving throw by her. I roll 8d6, can I use you guys' d6?"
Murph: Yeah.
"Zac: 8? Oh, shit."
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
"Ally: Yeah. I've six, I need two more."
Emily: There.
"Ally: Thank you. Okay, and if she fails she takes half of this."
"Brennan: Or if she succeeds, yeah."
"Ally: Or if she saves, yeah yeah."
Lou: She really wants to fail.
Ally: Yeah!
Siobhan: Whoa.
"Ally: Oh that's such a good roll. All right, that's 10."
"Emily: Oh, I love seeing my dice get 5."
Ally: 10.
Emily: Good job.
"Ally: 10, 1, 31."
Brennan: [sucks in a breath] Woo!
Emily: Take it all [grunts].
"Brennan: Pete, you are holding onto Nod. You see that Nod is like wheezing in your arms. And they look [wheezes] and whisper in your ear,"
"Nod: I'm sorry you didn't get a choice. I needed someone, and there wasn't any way for me to ask. I'm sorry. You can have all the strength you—"
"Brennan: You see that Nod like falls into your shoulder, like sort of passing out for a moment and you feel a power in your arm you haven't felt before and throw the biggest fireball you ever had and you see that these fires are not the nasty horrible nightmare ones you've done before, but these are like, torches and watchfires and bonfires and campfires of these fires of like stories shared and marches and struggles for victory and the entire subway gleams with light. Epona is very much still standing. But, stumbles back going [groans],"
"Epona: Kid, you're going down for that buddy."
"Ally: Oh, and then I use my bonus action to mind-link with Kingston and be like,"
Pete: I saw a recording of you saying you were gonna kill me.
Ally: And that's it.
"Brennan: [sucks in a breath] That's going to be, these guys. [moves Epona’s mini] Go ahead and take your attacks of opportunity."
"Murph: Oh, the rats? The rats don't stop her? [laughing] Insane. One of them's probably gonna hit. That's a, oh where's your attack? 18 to hit"
Brennan: 18 hits.
Murph: Sweet.
Emily: Ooh!
"Murph: 8 damage, good job, little guys."
Emily: [clapping] yeah.
Brennan: Holy shit!
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: Look at those little fuckers.
"Brennan: Yeah you see that a bunch of, Epona leaps over them but you see the rats go"
Rats: For our king!
"Brennan: And do that, you know in rugby when they'll like suddenly lift someone up in the air?"
Murph: Yeah [laughing].
Brennan: The rats lift up a tower of rats to bite her stomach and she goes
Epona: Fuck!
Brennan: As she leaps over them. [laughs] But she is going to take a swing at Kingston.
"Emily: Oh, my God."
Brennan: Hits—
Emily: So personal.
[whistling]
Zac: She has a two square range.
Brennan: Yep she has reach.
[tense music]
Siobhan: She got a flail?
Murph: Don't let her grab the baby with whatever the fuck that is.
"Brennan: Kingston, you take 30 points of damage."
[surprised noises from all]
Ally: What are you at?
Lou: 36.
"Brennan: You take 30 points of damage and are wrapped up in Epona's flail restrained. [gasping] You see, wham! She hits hard and says"
"Epona: Doesn't have to go down like this. if you just give me the kid. Otherwise, we're gonna have to do something about this."
Brennan: The onyx badge glows.
"Siobhan: Oh, no. Oh no, oh no."
[all groan with annoyance]
Murph: You knew it wasn't just the one person.
Brennan: Steam forms into shadowy spectral officers of the law.
"Ally: Fuck, I made a mistake by backing up."
Brennan: You see that the crooked badge glows and these crooked cops made of smoke appear in all the corners of the subway.
Murph: Shit.
Zac: All the cor— oh.
[tense music]
"Brennan: These two appear right here. And each of them appears, and that's gonna take their movement."
[air whooshing]
[music intensifies]
"Siobhan: God, they are so quick."
"Brennan: You see that, [air whooshing] these ones, one, two, three, four, five. [ghostly music] These guys rush towards you but do not have, just the one Sofia and the one's gonna attack Ox."
"Emily: Okay, 19 armor class."
"Zac: Do they not, do you not get an attack. Oh, wait, nevermind."
Murph: You only get one reaction per turn.
"Brennan: One misses Sofia, another one goes for Ox. What's Ox's AC?"
Ally: No!
"Zac: Oh, Ox's AC is a--"
"Emily: Jesus, this is dark."
Siobhan: 10.000.
Zac: Armor class is 13.
Emily: I throw my body in front of Ox.
Brennan: Ox takes 20 points of damage.
Emily: Ah.
"Zac: But he has 22 per the rat, does he get the juicy cockroach aura?"
"Brennan: Yeah, he gets the juicy cockroach."
"Zac: Okay, so then he's at 2 points of--"
Ally: No!
Murph: God bless the juicy cockroach
"Siobhan: Oh, my God."
Lou: How dare you?
"Emily: I hate, you are a sick son of a bitch."
"Brennan gives the camera two peace signs and cups his hands around his mouth, smugly."
Brennan: Gonna kill that dog.
[exclaiming]
Siobhan: He's the bad guy.
Brennan gives the camera two middle fingers.
Brennan: I'm all the bad guys. [makes cunnilingus gesture] So—
"Emily: Oh, my God--"
Brennan: I'm also gonna need Ox to make a constitution saving throw.
Zac: Ox!
"Lou: Wow, you monster."
Zac: 13.
Lou: Has to be enough.
Brennan: 13? That's not enough.
Ally: Fuck.
"Brennan: As one of these spectral cops reaches in, clutches Ox's heart, Ox's HP maximum is reduced by the amount of damage. Meaning he's—"
Zac: It can't go higher than 2?
Brennan: He can't go higher than 2.
Emily: For how long?
Brennan: Who knows?
Siobhan: Fuck.
[groaning]
Brennan: So Ox cannot be healed.
Emily: You are such a fucking sick son of a bitch—
"Ally: You are, that's not even real."
"Brennan: Ooh, we're having a ball with these bugsters. We're having a good time with Santa Claus. It's fight number four, baby. So, that is now going to be Ricky."
Emily: Yah.
[Ricky screams and the cast laughs]
Siobhan: Can Ricky go into a Rage because they hurt his dog?
Emily: Yeah!
"Zac: These are spectral, that's different from fiend and undead?"
Brennan: You think these are undead.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: In fact, if your Divine Sense—"
Zac: Yes.
Brennan: They're undead.
"Zac: Okay, do you know what the—"
"Brennan: You think these might be the spirits of like, crooked cops."
Emily: Crooked cops that died? Ugh.
Zac: Can I see what thirty feet is?
Brennan: Thirty feet? Yeah.
Zac: I'm trying to see if I can turn it—
"Brennan: What is it, 30 radius or 30 diameter?"
Zac: Within 30 feet.
"Brennan: Okay, oh, 30 foot radius, this is a 20 foot radius, so that's even bigger then that."
[whistling].
"Zac: Okay. I'm tryin' to figure out what, if there's a way to get all four of these dudes, if I moved here, could I turn all of these guys?"
"Brennan: Oh, you turn everybody in 30 foot radius?"
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: Okay.
Zac: If they fail a Wisdom saving throw.
"Brennan: Potentially, Epona's not undead. You know that?"
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: Okay.
"Emily: No, we want her here."
"Zac: I think Ricky notices something's going on with the badge. And that feels like an important part of this. So, I guess instead of that, maybe Kingston has something similar. Ricky's just gonna take a step forward and try to Divine Smite Epona."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Cool. So that would be, that's a 21 and a nat 20."
Ally: Yeah!
"Emily: Woo, woo!"
Zac: So those are my two attacks.
"Brennan: Cool. Okay, so you're trying to Divine Smite--"
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Go ahead and, I think you can add Divine Smite after you've rolled, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: So you can—
Murph: You can crit on a Divine Smite.
"Brennan: Yeah, you can crit and then be like ""that's a Divine Smite."""
Murph: Do you have other spell levels besides one?
Zac: I have one level two.
"Ally: Yeah, you could do—"
Murph: You could do level two.
"Brennan: Okay, so your first hit, yeah, find out what your first hit is."
Zac: That's 14 on the first hit.
Brennan: Okay.
"Zac: 1d8 plus seven so, yeah, 14."
Murph: Shouldn't it be 2 d8's 'cause you crit?
"Zac: Oh, well that was this, yeah."
"Brennan: Now the second one. So this one, it would be 3d8 plus your normal d8 so it's 4d8. Is that all times two? I think that's all--"
Murph: 4d8 times two. Yeah.
"Brennan: So, you're gonna roll 8d8."
"Siobhan: Fuck, okay I gotta bunch."
Ally: I gotta d8.
Murph: Critting as a Paladin is amazing.
Ally: Here's two d8 if you need them.
"Zac: Wait, so, okay."
Emily: It's not even my crit and I still feel like--
Ally: Woo! I didn't know what that nat 20 meant.
Zac: 8d8 on Epona.
Brennan: And then plus whatever you add to damage.
Murph: Plus your 7 or whatever.
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: Plus your 7, I think, right?"
Emily: Would it be 7 twice?
Brennan: No it's not 7 twice.
Zac: Okay.
"Emily: Okay, a couple 1s in there, that happens."
"Zac: This is 10, 12, 15, 25."
Emily: We have a really fun--
Zac: 31 plus 7
Ally: 38.
Zac: 38.
Ally: Woo!
Brennan: Jesus Christ.
"Ally: Damn, March."
"Brennan: You see, this one of these fucking specters hurts your dog. You look up at Epona, your ax gleams so bright you guys actually can't look at it. And, the shadow, it casts from Epona, you see that her shadow hits the wall crooked. Her long horse legs all jigsawed and zigzagging up on the wall. See, she goes,"
"Epona: Aye kid, New York's bravest versus New York's finest. You think you got what it takes?"
Ricky: I know I do.
"Brennan: Boom! You see that she staggers back, not dead, but so bad looking, and you see that you split her shadow in half and her shadow, part of her shadow is just missing."
Ally: Whoa!
Siobhan: What?
Lou: Shit.
Brennan: What an insane hit.
Zac: Does Ox go on this turn?
"Brennan: Yes, Ox goes on your turn."
"Zac: Ox is just going to try to bite the spectral thing in front of him. So, that's—"
Ally: Go Ox.
"Emily: Come on, Ox."
"Zac: Plus 4 to attack. Oh, it's just a 10."
"Brennan: Okay, so you, 10 does not hit. Ox lunges at this specter, nothing happens. That's going to be—"
"Zac: Oh, and as a bonus action I'll cast Shield of Faith on, who should I put it on? I guess I'll do that to Pete."
Brennan: Cool. Pete's AC goes up by 2. While you maintain concentration.
Ally: Thank you.
"Brennan: That's now going to be, the rats."
Murph: Hell yeah.
[giggling]
"Kugrash: All right, my children, my rat children, different then the other children, we'll talk about that later,"
Misty: So you do have rat children?
"Kugrash: Yeah, I mean these guys kind of, but, I'm using it, you know, kind of conversationally. Guys, kill the fucking centaur."
"Murph: The two in the back go towards centaur, or these guys towards centaur, these guys over here to the crooked cops."
"Brennan: Awesome, cool. These ones rush over here, these guys rush over here. These two go to close in on the centaur."
"Murph: Okay, so I'll do centaur first. 1 and a 9, that's not gonna do anything."
[exclaiming]
Ally: Crit.
Murph: Great! The other one got a 13.
"Brennan: Cool, a 13 for one of the cops in the back?"
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: That hits.
"Murph: Oh, sweet, okay. So I'll roll crit damage first. Uh, 7, 11, and their attacks count as magical because I'm a mighty summoner. So, I don't know if 'cause there ghosts they have like, resistance or anything but--"
"Brennan: Okay, these count as magical attacks?"
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: Got you, that's great."
"Murph: Okay, cool, and then the other guy hits for 10."
Ally: Hey.
Brennan: Woo! So the first one hits for what?
"Murph: 11 and then 10. Yeah, the crit was very similar to the--"
Brennan: Wild.
Ally: Yeah. Well?
"Brennan: You see that here in the subway it's Kugrash time, baby. These rats, they look and say,"
"Rat: Specters of those who swore to serve and broke their vow, let justice have its day!"
"Brennan: And they go into a little wave and crash on these, and actually badly fuck up these ghosts."
Emily: Yeah!
Murph: Okay.
"Brennan: They have featureless faces but you can imagine their surprise. That's going to be, Sofia."
"Emily: Okay, I wanna look at, first off, if i move into this square who gets opportunity attacks on me?"
"Brennan: Actually, no one gets an opportunity attack on you because you're not leaving any threatened areas."
"Emily: Okay, cool. Then I'm going to look at this, at Epona, and I'm going to put a curse on her. Look at her and channel the ferocity of the feline La Gran Gata and she is now under my curse."
[hissing sound]
"Siobhan: Wow, the curse of a woman from Staten Island."
Emily: AKA the Hexblade's Curse.
"Brennan: Yeah, a string of Italian and cat noises."
"Siobhan: Cazzo, vaffanculo!"
Brennan: Formaggio!
Ricky: What are you doing? I don't think I understand what--
Kugrash: I thought you were a monk. What's going on?
"Emily: And then, that was my bonus action, so I'm just gonna do two regular attacks."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: 'Kay, 26 to hit and then nat 1."
Brennan: Where are you stepping into? Right in front of her?
Emily: Right in front of her.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: What does it mean that she's cursed?
"Emily: Oh, so that means that now I crit on 19's and 20's. I add my proficiency bonus to damage rolls. If she dies I get more hit points."
"Ally: Whoa, that's huge."
Siobhan: Do we all crit on 19 and 20 or is it just you?
"Emily: Just me, and just on her."
"Brennan: Cool, one of yours hits."
"Emily: Okay, so, I have, it's gonna be just a 9 plus 3. So just 12."
Brennan: 12 gotcha.
"Emily: And then, I can't use any of these 'cause that's a bonus action, right?"
Brennan: Yep.
"Emily: All right, you know what? I'm gonna also throw up a fucking shield, 'cause that's a reaction."
"Brennan: Oh, can you just do that, or I think you probably can, right?"
Siobhan: I think it's before somebody attacks you.
"Murph: I think you can do it, do it before someone hits you."
"Emily: Okay, so I'll wait. So I don't throw up a shield."
"Brennan: Cool, awesome. That is going to be Kingston. You are still grappled right there."
"Lou: All right, she's grappling me with the?"
"Brennan: With the chain, yes."
"Lou: Great, can I cast Heat Metal?"
[sounds of agreement]
"Brennan: Yeah, you can cast Heat Metal, absolutely."
"Lou: Great, I'd like to cast Heat Metal. And do any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8."
"Zac: Wait, you take 2d8?"
"Lou: Yeah. No, they take, well, yes, she's holding it so she'll take 2d8."
"Brennan: You are also in contact, so if you're down to take the damage as well, you can do that."
"Lou: Great. I'll take the damage. Yeah, I'll take the damage."
"Brennan: Woo, baby!"
"Ally: Wow, okay."
"Lou: If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can."
"Ally: Oh, great."
"Lou: If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of its next turn."
"Brennan: Wow, fuck! Okay, so, she's gonna make a Constitution saving throw she has to drop the object. 8 plus… DC12, no that doesn't beat your DC. So, incredible. First of all roll your 2d8 damage."
"Lou: 6 and 8, 14."
Ally: Nice.
Brennan: You each take that.
"Lou: Yeah, okay."
"Brennan: Kingston, what do you do? You see that you're like restrained in these chains and you guys can hear the screeching of far away chains as Kingston's eyes glow. Epona looks at you as her hands begin to smoke. What do you say to her?"
"Lou: Nothing. [laughing] I think I'm weirdly, I'm not weirdly shaken but I'm shaken by Pete's revelation. And, I don't know, just kind of spinning on my own thoughts and just, yeah, gonna cast a massive—"
Brennan: She drops the weapon and you are freed. The chains fall away from you.
Lou: Great.
"Brennan: That... What an incredible use of Heat Metal. That's going to be, and then you also have your movement if you want."
Lou: I'll take a step just on the other side of Misty. Right here next to Alejandro.
"Brennan: Cool, and she would have gotten an attack of opportunity if she was holding her flail. That's now going to be, that's Sofia, Kingston, this little rat over here, scurries to here."
Ally: It's under a piece of pizza.
Brennan: It's under a little piece of pizza.
Siobhan: I haven't gone yet.
Brennan: Huh?
Siobhan: I haven't gone yet.
Brennan: You are after Pizza Rat.
Siobhan: Okay great. There's Pizza Rat?
"Brennan: Yeah, wait hold on, I'll show you. [picks up its mini, grins] Little Pizza Rat."
"Siobhan: Oh my goodness, he's so cute."
Ally: It’s so cute!
"Brennan: Cool, that's gonna be Misty."
"Siobhan: I would like to turn to Epona and go,"
"Misty: Hey, think you can beat this?"
"Siobhan: And I do a little tap dance, that's the exact choreography of the Officer Krupke dance— [Brennan laughing] from West Side Story. And, using that, I cast Irresistible Dance."
Brennan: Go ahead and give me the DC with the Performance check.
Siobhan: I have advantage on a Dexterity Performance check.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: And I got, ooh, a 17 plus 6, 23."
Brennan: She's gotta beat a 23. She begins to dance.
[hoof tapping noises]
"Siobhan: Hell yeah, so she now has, must use all of its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls."
Emily: [gasps] Interesting.
"Siobhan: And then she can, while the target is affected by the spell other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. So she has disadvantage on attack rolls and we all have advantage on attack rolls against her."
Emily: And she has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.
Siobhan: And she can take a wisdom saving throw to regain control of it on her turn.
"Brennan: Gotcha, so it's on her turn or at the end of her turn?"
Siobhan: As an action a dancing creature makes a wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself.
"Ally: Oh, as an action."
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: So it's, that is her turn if she wants to do it."
"Brennan: Gotcha, understood. Do you have any other actions you're taking?"
"Siobhan: Oh, I would like to, I'm gonna turn to Alejandro and be like,"
"Misty: Alejandro, that hat looks cool."
Siobhan: And I give Alejandro Bardic Inspiration.
"Brennan: Oh, wonderful, that's great. He smiles. As you give it to him you see he shouts at you and says,"
Alejandro: Holding onto this spell is extremely challenging for me. Any spells you can spare will make it easier for me to keep the trains on time.
Emily: Awesome.
Siobhan: So we can give him our spell slots?
"Brennan: If you guys throw spells at him on your turn, obviously you guys are dealing with plenty, but if you guys throw spells at him on your turn, it will help him out."
Siobhan: The train will get here faster.
"Brennan: Cool, speaking of which, that's going to be Alejandro. Which brings our first Box of Doom roll."
Lou: I like how casually you said it.
"Brennan: Alejandro is busy casting a spell to summon the train that takes you to Nod. Alejandro is going to roll a d20 on every one of his turns. The difficulty for this first turn summoning the train, he has to roll a nat 20."
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Brennan: Every time you guys give him a spell, he gets to roll an extra die on this roll."
Ally: Okay.
Siobhan: Does a nat 20 include the Bardic Inspiration or no?
Brennan: It does not include the bardic--
"Lou: Do you mind if I clarify something real quick? Giving him a spell, gives him like another chance--"
Brennan: Another d20 to roll on his turn.
"Lou: Like, that's on this turns. So if you gave him spells next turn it would be—"
Brennan: For the next turn.
"Lou: Got it, but it's not forever."
Brennan: Not forever.
Lou: It's not he rolls two dice forever.
Brennan: Correct.
Emily: Does anyone wanna give him a thing now?
Zac: I could give him a spell.
Murph: I think we need to--
Brennan: You guys have to do it on your turn.
Emily: But what if our spell's a reaction?
Brennan: You could do it.
Murph: Can it be any level of spell?
Brennan: It can be any level of spell.
"Emily: Okay, I guess, I have a spell. I have one spell slot and I can use a reaction to give it to him right now."
"Brennan: Cool, you look at him, extend your arm and some of La Gran Gata's sparkling glittering treasure magic flows from your hand. Alejandro's gonna roll two d20. 7 and 4. He holds onto the spell,"
Alejandro: Where is this fucking train?
"Lou: Hey, thank you."
Ally: Wow.
Emily: Maybe I should have saved it.
"Brennan: Great, that's gonna go to the top of the order, its gonna be Kugrash."
"Kugrash: Okay. We got a juicy cockroach. We got some rats, but it's not nearly dirty enough in here yet."
Murph: And I wanna summon some shit. More shit head animals. I'm gonna cast conjure and I'm—
"Brennan: What is the challenge rating that, the max challenge rating you can do. Or how many of these challenge ratings can you do?"
Murph: I can do one of two or lower. I think I'd like to do four of half rating.
"Brennan: Murph, you're my best friend."
Murph: Great.
Brennan: Do you know why?
Murph: Why?
"Brennan: You call forth for the dirtiest, beefiest boys in the world, and our friends [cast cheering!] the albino alligators go [panting] and charge up out of the cracks underneath the sewer here. Where do you want them to appear?"
Murph: I want them to go after these ghosts that are approaching Pete.
Brennan: The beefiest boys come charging out of the subway—
"Kugrash: Oh, they're so fucking beefy."
[panting]
Brennan: You see that one of them glares over at Misty. You see he has like a little smokey eye and is still bitter about your assessing its chances in show business.
Misty: You know what kid? I like your spunk. Send me your resume.
Ally: Always networking.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll an initiative for the beefy boys?
"Murph: What is there, I don't have their stats in front me but I got an 11."
"Brennan: Oh, an 11 is going to be. So they're going to act on an 11. They're actually on the same initiative as your rats. So the rats and the alligators are gonna go together."
Emily: It's crooked cops versus crooked crocs.
"Brennan: Incredible, is Kugrash doing any moves?"
"Murph: Let me see, okay. So that's my action, I am just gonna stay put."
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: I think.
"Brennan: Rad, then that's gonna be Pete."
"Ally: Okay, I'm gonna move up two squares so that I'm more like with the group, next to,"
Brennan: Right here?
Ally: My friend formally known as Kingston. And I'm gonna face this way and I'm gonna start casting Scorching Rays out at these ghosts. Can I reach if it's 120? 120 feet?
"Brennan: Yeah, or for sure you can reach those ghosts."
Ally: Cool.
Brennan: You could probably reach any ghosts in here.
"Ally: Great, I'm gonna cast it as a third level so I get one extra ray and that makes four. So I'm gonna attack these four."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead. Go ahead and roll that attack 'cause you're gonna blast each of those incoming."
Ally: Is it four separate attacks?
"Brennan: It is four separate attacks, let me know what you get."
Ally: Nat 1.
Brennan: First once misses.
"Ally: 18, 10—"
Murph: You're not adding the spell on the attack.
Siobhan: It’s on the next page.
Murph: Plus an 18.
"Brennan: Cool, and roll the last one."
Ally: 16.
"Brennan: Cool, and so you hit the three, those last three that you go for. Go ahead and mark your sorcery point that you spent. And then I'm gonna--"
"Ally: Oh no, I just as a higher spell slot."
"Brennan: Oh, higher spell slot, got you. Go ahead and give me, roll 2d6 for each one of them."
"Ally: Cool. Okay, thanks. And I only hit two right?"
"Brennan: You only hit two, or you hit three, sorry."
"Ally: Oh, yeah yeah, okay cool. Oh, I'll do these separate, right. Yeah, fuck yeah. Yeah, bitch. I got a 6 and 8. One is 11, one is 8 and one is 7."
"Brennan: Cool, one is 11, one is 8, one is 7, gotcha."
Ally: Thank you.
Murph: Of course.
"Brennan: Dope, that's now going to be, that's Pete, awesome. I'm gonna make a little roll here."
Emily: Is it a Wisdom saving throw?
"Brennan: No, nothing for saving throw. You guys hear— [train noises]"
Lou: This is a wild sight—
"Siobhan: No, no, ooh."
"Brennan: And you guys see almost clipping the tails of your beefy boys, a train whizzes past you. But this is a normal L train that just pushes past into the station. You guys, so you see the train sort of rushes by. As it rushes by it actually skips this stop as Alejandro's golden eye glows brighter and he goes,"
Alejandro: Come on!
Emily: So if we had been standing there we would have got hit by a train.
Brennan: That's absolutely correct. Big old fucking train would have clobbered somebody.
"Murph: Cool, cool, cool."
Lou: Good to know.
"Zac: It'd be crazy if like, nevermind."
Emily: Let's all try and push Epona in there.
"Lou: Epona, get in the thing."
"Emily: It feels too cruel, I'd rather just kill her."
"Lou: Yeah right, her body'd just be mutilated."
Murph: What does the MTA employee see? It’s just hitting a horse cop with a train?
"Lou: Just a horse in the center just, hitting a horse."
Emily: They would definitely have an internal review about what happened.
Brennan: Sofia takes 25 points of damage as Epona kicks out with her hooves.
"Emily: Wait but, I thought she was dancing. Did she pass—"
Brennan: Ooh!
Emily: Her Wisdom saving throw?
"Brennan: Does the dance actually? Yeah, she's gotta make her Wisdom saving throw, sorry about that."
"Siobhan: She just gets disadvantage. She just gets, she can't move."
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: She can't move?
Siobhan: And has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls.
"Emily: And attack, did she take disadvantage?"
Brennan: Oh she's gotta take disadvantage on that.
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Let me see if she still hits. She does still hit.
Zac: And I have Sentinel also.
"Emily: 25 you said, right?"
"Brennan: Oh, she's within five feet so, but she's not moving."
"Zac: Oh, but, I thought it was if she also takes an attack on someone other than me."
"Brennan: You get an attack on her? Yeah, see, you actually get an attack on her."
"Zac: Okay, cool."
"Siobhan: Sick, and you get advantage on that attack."
Zac: I do?
"Siobhan: Yes, everybody gets advantage against her."
Lou: Everybody gets advantage.
"Zac: So, yeah, 26."
Ally: Nice.
"Brennan: Yeah, that'll do it."
Emily: I’m at 37.
"Zac: 1, 8, I hit her for 13."
Brennan: You hit her for how much damage?
Zac: 13.
"Brennan: 13, she is looking fucked up. You see, yeah, she goes to kick Sofia and just her taking her focus off of you for a second the questing blade swings up on your fireman's axe, connects deep into like the horse haunch right in front of her. She's looking hurt, gang."
Emily: Massively confused as the first time in my life I got kicked by a horse.
"Offscreen, there is a sound of water filling a cup. It is Ally getting a drink."
Lou: That sound came out of nowhere.
Ally: I'm just over here peeing.
Siobhan: I feel like every season we gotta have Ally doing something—
"Emily: Something weird, just like crunching it as it goes through your mouth."
"Ally: It's two hour long games guys, you gotta stay hydrated."
"Emily: So disrespectful, right next to the person who's talking."
"Brennan: One of your rat swarms, Murph, takes 6, 9, 12, takes 20 points of damage."
"Murph: Oh, shit, they're hurt."
"Emily: Whoa, they have more than 20 points of damage?"
Murph: They have 24 plus they're a little beefier cause I'm a mighty summoner.
Emily: That is a strong swarm.
"Ally: Beefy, beefy rats."
"Brennan: And that 14, 23. Another one takes 30 points of damage."
"Murph: Shit, he dead."
Brennan: One of these rat swarms is gone. Then the rest of these boys are coming along.
"Emily: Oh, I love these crocs. I love that they're on our side."
Ally: They were so strong.
Emily: I know.
Murph: We were merciful to them.
Emily: We should always try to recruit bad guys to be on our side in the next fight.
Murph: It only works with like gators and rats.
"Emily: You think we could get some of these crooked cops, next game?"
Murph: Crooked cop ghosts.
Emily: I think ghosts of crooked cops--
Murph: Stay away from those beefy boys.
"Brennan: These two come over, one of them's gonna hit one of your gators, not at all. Does not hit a gator."
Murph: Great.
"Brennan: Then one attacks, does hit a gator, for 25."
Murph: Shit. [whistling] How much HP does my gator have? 'cause he gets 2 extra hit points per hit die.
Brennan: Per hit die.
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: He's just barely alive.
Murph: Cool.
Brennan: As this—
Murph: Only his beefiness keeps him alive.
Lou: Thank God for beef.
"Brennan: One, two, three, four, five, six."
Emily: No. Oh my God. Stay away from the dog you crooked pieces of shit.
"Brennan: Pete, you see that as you protect Nod, Epona calls out,"
"Epona: Get Nod, get the child, the orphan."
"Brennan: And these two are going to, because you're protecting Nod, they're gonna come for you."
Ally: I reaction cast a Shield.
Brennan: Awesome.
[clapping]
Ally: My AC goes up 2 so now it's at 20.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: Sorry, my AC goes up 5, it was already up 2. So now it's at 20."
"Brennan: And now it's at 20, Jesus."
"Emily: Yeah, try and hit."
"Brennan: You were a goner and at the last second [air whooshing] you see an emblem of just like flat bubbly balloons and weird dream energy and [explosion] singes the hand of one of these specters. It was about to sink it's smokey hand into your chest. You avoid the attacks. And then one's gonna go for Sofie and one's gonna go for Ricky. Sofie, it's a miss. Ricky that's a hit. I'm gonna need you to give me a Constitution saving throw."
"Zac: Okay, Constitution saving throw."
"Emily: Oh, it's gonna touch your heart."
"Zac: Fuck. I got a 4. Oh, can I use a lucky point?"
Brennan: Sure.
Emily: Yeah.
"Zac: Okay, that's an 11."
"Ally: Oh, I will do Bend Luck and use two sorcery points-- Is that a d4?"
Brennan: You've already used your reaction to cast Shield.
Ally: That would have been a reaction to use Bend Luck?
"Brennan: That would have been a reaction to use Bend Luck. No worries. Cool, Ricky you take 27 points of damage."
Emily: Ooh!
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: And your HP max is reduced the same amount.
"Zac: 20, 27?"
"Brennan: 27 and your HP max comes down. You see that one of these guys reaches into Ricky's back, squeezes his lungs and you feel yourself [gasping]. And your HP max is reduced by 27 as well. Keep the original number but for this battle--"
Zac: Okay.
"Ally: What is your, what is it?"
Zac: So I had 11 more because of the juicy cockroach so 11--
Brennan: Those 11 temp are gone--
"Zac: Yeah, and then--"
Brennan: And then whatever--
Zac: My 16 from-- whatever.
"Brennan: Yes, exactly. So your HP max is reduced by 16. Epona's gone, those specters have gone. That's now going to be, Ricky, that's you."
"Zac: Oh, Ricky's just gonna turn the unholy right here."
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: And get all these spectral guys.
"Emily: Try and get 'em all in there, maybe another train come along."
"Zac: Send them away, everyone within 30 feet from me has to make a,"
Murph: Nice.
Zac: What is it?
Emily: Wisdom saving?
"Zac: Yeah, it's a Wisdom saving throw."
"Brennan: Everyone within 30 feet, okay, cool. So one, two, three, four all have to make Wisdom saving throws."
Ricky: Get these crooked cops out of here.
"Brennan: Wonderful, okay. And it's a Wisdom saving throw?"
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: Look at the cockroaches just crouched in battle with us. Just emitting a beneficial ooze.
Murph: You know he's a member of the party at this point.
"Brennan: Ricky, you see, where are you turning your attention most to?"
Zac: I think I'm noticing that they're coming over here and they're coming at--
"Brennan: Coming for Pete, yeah. Cool, you see, you turn to these three, hold your axe aloft, what do you say to these cops?"
"Zac: I think I say,"
Ricky: You're a disgrace.
"Brennan: You see, as you say they're a disgrace, every part of you that has against all odds been as pure and made of just wanting to help people since you were a tiny child, glows with holy light and all three of them go [hacking] and begin to break and snap like crooked things and all three of these guys turn to flee."
Ally: Yes!
Zac: And then is it Ox's turn.
Brennan: It is Ox's turn.
Ally: Does Ox have any spell slots?
"Zac: Ox... If he hit one of them they would keep, that would break the spell, right? So I think Ox is just gonna go, go over here to just be kind of a thing in the way of Alejandro and whatever else is coming."
"Brennan: Awesome, great, rats and alligators."
Lou: Rats and alligators.
"Murph: Oh, dope,"
"Kugrash: All right beefies. Work on the ones that are hurt,"
Murph: So I would like them to kind of concentrate fire on these two guys--
Brennan: The two guys-- that killed some of the rats?
"Murph: That have taken damage, yeah."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Murph: So I'll have the rat go first. He's at half life so he does less damage. He doesn't hit anyway. Two gators on the one guy, I'm gonna guess 18 plus whatever their strength is gonna hit."
Brennan: They got a plus 4 so the 18 hits.
Murph: So 11 and a 22.
Brennan: 11 does not hit.
"Murph: Okay, what do they do? Do they do 2 d10's?"
Brennan: These guys do 1 d10 plus two.
"Murph: 1d10 plus 2. So 6, and then I think he might be grappled."
"Brennan: He is grappled. Actually, no, these guys cannot be grappled."
"Murph: Got it, okay."
Brennan: So Pete does 6 damage to this one over here.
"Murph: Ah, cool, the other two gators will go after the other guy. That is, what did they have plus 8, sorry?"
Brennan: 4.
"Murph: Okay, 11 and 10."
Brennan: Those do not hit [bitting]. But they look plenty busy with all these gators and rats in front of them.
Murph: Other two rats go after Epona.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Don't they have advantage?
Murph: Oh--
Emily: Oh yah.
Siobhan: Oh yes they do
Ally: Thank God.
Murph: Then I'll just count this as the ones. That's 14 to hit.
Brennan: 14 hits.
"Murph: Sweet, and the other guy, 17 hit or 15 hit rather."
Brennan: Roll damage for both.
"Murph: Yeah, the rats are awesome. 10, 10 damage"
"Brennan: Kugrash, you've been having some struggles in the sunlit world. Times Square is not your scene, Bodega's not your scene. These fuckers came below ground. Your rats, like how the sea recedes before a tidal wave, draw back from Epona. She is beaten and bloodied from the blows of Sofia and Ricky. She makes eye contact with you and she goes to grab her mace again. What does Kugrash say to her?"
"Kugrash: Live like a rat, die like a rat."
[squealing]
"Brennan: A torrent, a helix of rats swarms over her, as the rats swarm she is covered and as they crash down, she is gone. Not a trace of her-- is left."
"Emily: Wait, but what about-- the onyx thing?"
Brennan: The rats ate it.
Ally: The rats ate it?
Brennan: The rats ate the badge.
Siobhan: That's fucked up.
"Murph: Kugrash is crying with, like, nobody knows what a couple of days he has but— he's sobbing."
"Ally: Oh, Kugrash."
"Brennan: Epona's fucking dead, extremely dead. And whatever that artifact was, it's in the stomach of several rats."
"Emily: I'm at 40 now, just, I got some hit points from that."
Lou: Hell yeah. Dude.
Brennan: Incredible.
"Ally: Oh yeah, nice."
"Brennan: That is incredible, that's great. So that's the rats and alligators. Sofia, that's you."
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna come protect the dog. Where's the dog? Oh, he's right here. So I wanna go after this guy to make sure he can't attack the dog. [laughing] And I'm gonna just attack him."
Zac: A 19.
"Emily: Well, it doesn't crit anymore 'cause Epona's gone. Okay, does a 12 hit him?"
Brennan: Nope.
Emily: Does a 27 hit him?
"Brennan: Yes, it does."
Ally: No.
Emily: Okay and it's gonna be 9.
Brennan: 9 damage.
"Emily: And then, oh how's he look?"
"Brennan: And your weapons do not count as magical, correct?"
Emily: No.
"Brennan: I don't believe so, no worries. 9, great."
"Emily: But, how does he look?"
Brennan: He hasn't been injured up to this point.
Emily: Okay I'm gonna Flurry Blows him.
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: So then I'm gonna do two backhands. One's gonna hit, one's not."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: And that's gonna be 8, another 8."
"Brennan: Another 8 damage, hell yeah [impact sounds] You are hitting the smokey incorporeal form of this guy boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, as hard as you can just working him like a punching bag. Awesome, that's your action and your bonus, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Kingston, that's gonna be you."
"Lou: Great, I'm gonna give three spells to Alejandro. And then I'll take four, or like two steps that way and cast Turn Undead."
"Brennan: I love it, you, half the act of giving a spell is casting a spell."
"Lou: Fantastic, I will give him three spells then. Or is it just one?"
"Brennan: So you can use like a bonus, you can give him like a Healing Word as a bonus action but you have to, the action that it would take to cast the spell--"
Lou: Got it.
Brennan: Is the action-- it takes to give the spell.
Lou: Can I give him a bonus action?
Brennan: Healing Word?
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. The level of the spell doesn't affect how many dice are rolled. So, a low level spell is fine."
"Emily: Oh, okay."
Ally: Cool.
Lou: Great.
"Brennan: Awesome, you give him one. Kingston raises your hand and just-- [explosion] it's like city lights shoots out of your hand into Alejandro's golden eye and he used it to like wrangle the spell some more, and you see him bolstered by the power of your magic. Go ahead and take your Turn Undead action. Where are you going to?"
Lou: Can I take two steps that way and cast an Undead?
"Brennan: Yes, you can. One, two. I believe they're all within 30 feet, let me just double check. Yep, they're all within 30 feet and you turn undead. Awesome, you see that these two begin to turn to flee from you. [whooshing] What does Kingston say as he raises up his hand?"
Lou: Still silent.
Brennan: Still silent [ringing] The undead are repelled. That is now going to be-- Pizza Rat.
"Emily: Oh my God, my skirt kind of matches the Dalmation."
Brennan: Pizza Rat’s going under subway steps.
Emily: What is Pizza Rat gonna do?
Ally: I cast Bless on Pizza Rat.
"Brennan: Misty, that's gonna be you."
"Siobhan: Ah, shit, well, I would like to give Alejandro a spell."
Brennan: Okay.
"Siobhan: And then, the turned guys are just gonna run away, right? Do they have a chance to save from being turned? What happens to them? These three guys next to the cockroach."
Brennan: It's turned for one minute or until it takes any damage.
"Siobhan: Oh, okay then I will go and attack the one next to Sofia with my rapier."
"Brennan: Awesome, hell yeah. So you take a step here. Go for it, roll your attack."
Siobhan: Great. 17.
"Brennan: 17, that hits."
"Siobhan: Great. Ooh, that is 11 points of damage."
"Brennan: 11 points of damage, hell yeah. Awesome, that's Misty. Back to Alejandro and the box of doom."
Emily: Now we got three.
"Brennan: We have three dice rolling the difficulty, also lowers by one, so now on a 19 or 20."
Emily: Oh.
Brennan: The train is sunk.
"Ally: And he has four right, 'cause he has one of his own?"
"Brennan: No, the one of these is his own and then he has one from Kingston and Misty."
"Ally: Okay, I thought you gave him a bonus action one too. Or you used that?"
Lou: I just gave him one.
"Ally: Ah, for sure."
"Brennan: Here we go, 3d20. Actually, why don't you, I'll roll Alejandro's and you two each roll with your dice."
"Ally: Oh, and, a question, can I use bend luck on this?"
Brennan: You can not use bend luck on this.
Lou: I can't see mine.
"Brennan: Nope, no 19's."
"Murph: 3, 1 and 5."
Emily: Brutal!
Brennan: Alejandro--
"Alejandro: Come on, there are millions of people in this city that they rely on public transportation to get where they need to go!"
Siobhan: Cuomo!
Emily: Can I get—
Alejandro: Cuomo will be the death of us all!
"Brennan: Incredible, at the end of Alejandro's turn you see that these two guys go straight into the ground and these three go straight up through the ceiling and vanish. As they all flee, but they're incorporeal so they just go through shit."
"Ally: Oh, right."
"Brennan: Bad-a-boom, that's going to be, Kugrash again."
"Murph: Sweet, okay, I got concentration going, I don't wanna mess with my gators. Tell me if this is too, can I use a Cantrip? Also I wanna, basically I wanna run up to Alejandro, I wanna give him Guidance, and I wanna give him a Misty Step 'cause it's a bonus action spell. So I wanna do like action, cantrip, bonus action, spell."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you can do that."
Emily: We can give him Cantrips?
Ally: We can give him anything.
"Brennan: No, Cantrips, not for spells. You need to actually burn a slot to give him a spell to Cantrip."
"Emily: Oh, okay."
"Murph: Okay, So that doesn't do me any good. In that case I'll just burn a first level spell then for him. I'll give him a Healing Word."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Okay, you're gonna give him a Healing Word?"
"Murph: Yeah, so I have to move, I have to, no wait, I don't have to touch him for a healing word so I can kinda stay put. Healing Word, and then I guess I'll, for my action I guess I'll prepare if anybody comes within range I'll whack 'em with my stick. [laughing] Actually, no fuck that. I'm gonna turn into like a goddamn bear."
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
Emily: Yeah. Why not.
"Murph: I'm, a fucking, yeah. Just some kind of awesome-- I'm a druid."
Siobhan: A dumb city bear. You're like the zoo bear and it's all like--
"Brennan: You see that the rats all praise you and as they do you just, it doesn't look pretty, it's like a weird bubbling, like [bubbling], you just swell up into the form of a giant bear."
"[exclaiming, bear roaring]"
Murph: I would like to have darts in me like as if I like escaped the zoo.
"Brennan: Incredible, [moving the minis; Nod’s falls] oh gray baby!"
Ally: Gray baby.
"Brennan: Gray baby having a hard time. Cool, that's Kugrash's turn. I'm also gonna need, by the way, we have failed to do this. I'm gonna need two wild magic surge rolls from Pete."
Ally: 13.
Brennan: And again.
Ally: 19.
"Brennan: Cool, great."
Zac: I don't know what that was.
Brennan: So now on a 4 or lower you surge.
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: That's going to be Pete.
"Ally: Okay, I have a question. Can I use sorcery points, I know I can turn them into spell slots, and can I give those to Alejandro? Or that's just like possible spells, not really per turn."
"Brennan: That's possible, also you could bonus action turn them but you still need to take the action to cast the spell to give it to him."
"Ally: Right, right, okay cool. So, I'm just going, can I do a bonus action and give him that and a spell?"
Brennan: Do you have a bonus action spell that you can cast or is it--
Ally: I have Shield again but I don't know if--
"Brennan: Shield's a reaction yeah, you could, on your, on his turn if you want to reaction cast a Shield at him you can give him another die, yeah"
"Ally: Okay, cool. Yeah I'm gonna, let's see. I'm just gonna stay where I am. I'm next to a bear, I like that. So I'm going to give Alejandro a first level spell slot. I'm gonna give him Sleep."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: And I'll be ready to give him Shield when he goes to roll so he'll have--
"Brennan: Oh, you're gonna give him two spells? Cool, so you give him a spell on your turn, you give him Sleep, and then, Shield. You guys see, where'd I put you? Over here on this platform [whooshing], train rushes past going in the opposite direction. Alejandro's concentrating on his spell as much as he can. You guys see that these cops that are left look at you and begin to call out and you see that there's no mouth but the voice echoes from them saying,"
Cop: [gasping] The badge is broken. We are released. We do not wish to capture the child of dreams. We wish to devour. Let the monarch of Nod fall and our bondage be released.
"Brennan: And they call, no longer under the control of Epona, [whooshing] piling out from around corners, [whooshing continues] from all around you guys more spectral police—"
Ally: Fuck!
Brennan: Appear. And they are going to attack. These guys are going for these two crocs. The injured one is gone.
Murph: 'Kay.
"Brennan: The next one's going to take one, two, three, four--"
Lou: Shit.
"Brennan: 16, 17, 20 points of damage so it's still alive over here. This one's gonna go right through and attack the same alligator."
Murph: No!
Brennan: And that's a nat 20.
Murph: Fuck.
[whooshing]
"Brennan: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten eleven, twelve This one has used all, is menacing, is used all it's movement, it's not going to attack but basically, you know, barrels down on top of Pete. This one's going to, one, two, three, four, five, six. And then we'll go Ricky, this ones moving too-- I'll come over here and hit one of these rat swarms."
"Emily: I'd rather the rats than the dog, no offense, Kug."
"Brennan: 7, 14, 16, 19 damage to one of those rat swarms over there."
Murph: Okay.
Ally: The dog is so cute.
Zac: He's still alive.
Emily: I know.
Zac: I know we're not talking about it right now but the dog is so cute.
Emily: I know that I'm like supposed to be protecting the gray baby but my entire directive has become protect Ox. [laughing] 'Cause he's only got 2 hit points.
Brennan: This one comes right over here behind Pete as well. These guys are gonna take some attacks. One of them's going for Ricky. It's gonna be a hit. Ricky I need a constitution saving throw.
"Zac: All right. Oh, I forgot to say because of my Aura of Protection do I also add charisma?"
"Brennan: You also add that, yep."
"Zac: Okay, cool, and everyone within ten feet of me does."
"Brennan: Yeah, I'm also gonna need you to roll a, forgot, a Constitution check for that Shield of Faith."
"Zac: Okay, so what do I have to get? It was, I got hit for 27."
"Brennan: So that's gonna be a 13, DC13."
"Zac: Okay, got it."
"Brennan: 18, you succeed, cool."
"Zac: Nice. So, Constitution saving throw."
"Brennan: Now, yeah."
"Zac: Fuck, use my luck point 'cause that was a nat 1. [laughing] All right, okay, so that would be 3, 5, that's 13."
"Brennan: 13, you take, you take 22 points of damage."
Zac: Sheesh.
"Brennan: You rolled what, a 13?"
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: Your hit point max is reduced by that amount as well.
Zac: By 13 or by 22?
Brennan: Again by 13— so—
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: Now your hit point max is like what?
Emily: 33.
Zac: 33.
Brennan: Ricky—
Zac: So--
Brennan: Is looking badly injured. One of these guys comes for Sofia.
"Emily: Bring it on, better me than Ox."
Zac: I'm at 24.
"Brennan: That does not hit. That is the spectral cops around you guys. Ricky, that's gonna be you."
"Zac: Okay. Fuck. If I give a spell spot I can't also attack, right? Or let's say, okay--"
Brennan: If you use a bonus action spell then you can.
"Zac: Okay, if I use my bonus action spell of Shield of Faith would it undo the other Shield of Faith, even though, it's-- concentration?"
Brennan: It's concentration.
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: It would undo the other one.
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: Or actually—
Zac: Because I'm not using it.
"Brennan: Yeah, that's true. You're not maintaining, yeah you're just giving it to him. So, I will rule that because you have a bonus action spell you can give that spell slot to Alejandro."
"Zac: Okay, cool, I will do that and I'm gonna take a five foot step in here more. So these are all within ten feet of me, right?"
Brennan: Yep.
Zac: And then I'm going to attack this one.
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
"Zac: Yeah, okay, cool. 17 and then 18."
Brennan: Those are both gonna hit.
"Zac: Yeah, okay, so d8. Okay, 8, and then 9."
Brennan: 8 and 9?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Okay, you slash that guy up [slashing], your ax cleaves through the smoke and shadow. You guys can like feel the darkness descending on you in this subterranean platform. That's going to be the rats and alligators."
"Murph: Oh, yeah, two rats on the guy in the back."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: 15 and 19.
Brennan: 15 and 19 both hit.
Murph: Sweet.
Emily: Ooh!
"Murph: I think they do less damage. I think these guys have both been hit, right? These guys back here, or has that guy been hit?"
"Emily: No, this is the guy that's been hit, he's new."
Brennan: Oh one of the rat swarms have been hit?
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: One of them has been badly injured.
"Murph: Okay, so one of them is gonna do full, so 10 from one of them."
Brennan: Jesus.
Emily: Ooh!
Murph: And the other one does another 6.
Ally: Yeah!
Emily: Damn
Siobhan: You are killing it from the ground.
Murph: 16 damage.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: And then the other rat, I guess is gonna run forward and go after one of the cops with two gators with him."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Okay, so I'll do the rat first, only 9. No, none of them are gonna hit."
[explosions]
"Brennan: Keeping these spectral cops busy over here, that's going to be Sofia."
"Emily: All right, I'm just gonna fuck up the guy in front of me because he's coming after Ox so, let's see, 13 hit?"
Brennan: 13 does hit.
"Emily: Okay, then both of them hit for, let's see, 10 and a 13. That's 23. Gonna flurry blows, 'cause why the fuck not."
Zac: Is he still standing?
Emily: Is he still standing?
"Brennan: He's still standing, yep."
"Emily: Okay, I got, those are both gonna hit, and then 9, and 9 for another 18."
Brennan: Hell yeah. That guy's looking messed up. The one in front of Sofia's looking messed up.
Emily: He should be looking way more messed up.
Brennan: You see that your fists are not connecting like you want with his smokey body.
Emily: Oh!
Zac: Are they like halves?
Emily: 'Cause I'm s'posed to be magic. That's why I'm not doing jack shit to them. Mother fucker.
Zac: Is it even hurting it?
"Brennan: It is hurting him. He's fucked up, he looks hurt."
"Emily: Wait, but I've got Fists of Apollo on me that's a magic item. What are my hands doing?"
Brennan: What's your hit points at right now compared to your total?
Emily: My hit points to my total are 40 and my total is 52.
"Brennan: Cool, so your ability doesn't trigger until you're more fucked up than you are right now."
"Emily: Yeah, yeah. Shit dude, what if I cast mage, oh no, that takes an action."
"Brennan: Kingston, that's gonna be you."
"Lou: Great. I'll take I guess two steps, or like one. Yeah, one step there and then can I cast second level Command on these two?"
"Brennan: Sure, you can hit two targets?"
Lou: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: With a second level, yeah."
"Lou: Yeah, second level Command."
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: Yeah, and I issue the order of flee."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: I have a question, so if the rats are doing magical damage, can I hit someone with a rat?"
Ally: You wrap a rat around your fist--
Emily: Can I wrap a rat around my fist?
Zac: Make nunchucks out of a rat—
Emily: And punch him with a rat.
Siobhan: Tie their tails together.
Murph: What was that movie? What was it?
Lou: Enter the Fist?
Murph: Yeah.
Zac: Kung Pao.
"Murph: Kung Pao, there you go."
Brennan: You see that both of them screech and are blinded by your light and turn to flee.
Murph: Nice.
Siobhan: Great man.
"Brennan: That is incredible. If you want to give, on your turn, if you want to give me—"
Emily: Get hit with a rat?
"Brennan: A Sleight of Hand to do some rat chucks, we can see about that."
Emily: I'm back in the game.
"Brennan: Emily, the DC’s gonna be [winks] pretty high."
Emily: Is it gonna be an Acrobatics check?
Brennan: It's gonna be a sleight of hand check.
Emily: Sleight of hand.
Brennan: It's not Acrobatics to tie two rats together to use them like nunchucks.
Lou: What if you throw them in the air and then you jump in the air and then you and the rats are all in the air together?
Brennan: Incredible.
"Emily: What about Stealth, instead of Sleight of Hand?"
"Zac: Could I have, I forgot to use Ox's turn to make a perception check."
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: Can I do that?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Zac: What's goin' on with that Pizza Rat? He gets advantage too, so 19."
Brennan: Seems like the Pizza Rat's coming down the stairs with a big heavy slice of pizza.
[cast laughing]
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: That's what it seems like to Ox.
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: There's also a lot going on. That's gonna be Misty.
Siobhan: So I'm gonna give Alejandro my Misty Step spell and then I'm going to cast Hypnotic Pattern on those three guys back there by the stairs.
"Brennan: Cool, what does Hypnotic Pattern do, remind me?"
Siobhan: A 30 foot cube within range the pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save the creature becomes charmed for the duration.
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: And when charmed by the spell the creature is incapacitated and has the speed of zero.
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: And the spell ends if they're attacked.
"Brennan: You throw up your charm, your Hypnotic Pattern in front of them [whooshing]. There featureless, expressionless faces do not perceive the illusion. These creatures of death are beyond the reach of joy, wonder, or whimsy, and the spell cannot charm their cold dead hearts."
"Siobhan: Okay, well, I'm gonna turn to Sofia and go,"
"Misty: Hey, did you know your skirt kind of looks like Ox's skin."
Siobhan: And I give her Bardic Inspiration for this ratchucks roll.
"Sofia: Oh my God, you're so right. I do have it in me to tie two rats together to make nunchucks."
"Brennan: Okay we're about to roll a lot of dice in the Box of Doom. I'm gonna need 2d20 from Pete, 1d20 from Ricky, a d20 from Misty and I think a d20 from Kingston."
"Murph: No, I get one—"
"Brennan: No, not Kingston-- from Kugrash. So, get your d20's ready. I'll get mine on an 18 or higher."
Ally: Okay.
Zac: Come on.
Ally: Come on.
Siobhan: Come on.
Emily: Come on.
Brennan: And go.
All of them roll in the Box of Doom. None of the rolls are high enough.
Emily: Fuck.
"Lou: Oh, is that 1, no it's 12."
Ally: Oh a 16 or an 18.
Brennan: Its a 16
Ally: Dammit.
Emily: Are you kidding me?
Siobhan: Shit. Give me my dice.
"Brennan: Get your dice back gang. Ooh, a lot of magic went into that one. Alejandro's having a hard time."
Ally: Fuck!
Siobhan: Fuck man.
Emily: Yah. I'm not impressed with Alejandro right now.
Ally: Is Alejandro—
Alejandro: It's extremely complex magic to call this train to dream.
"Sofia: Yeah, in your defense I can't hit-- for shit--"
Ally: I am bothered by your whole thing
Brennan: That is now going to be Kugrash.
"Murph: Sweet. I am going to, deet deet deet deet deet. To end Wild Shape, is that a bonus action or?"
"Brennan: Yep, you automatically revert."
"Murph: Okay, I think I'm gonna turn back into a rat so I can cast spells again. That was fun."
"Kugrash: That was fun, gang."
Murph: I'm going to call lightning.
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Which means I'll break concentration on the gators.
[whooshing]
"Brennan: Gators are gone, boom."
Kugrash: Live on my faithful gators.
"Murph: And then I want to do it right there, 'cause it affects everybody within five feet."
"Brennan: Cool, boom. You hit those three."
"Murph: Then it is, they do a Dex saving throw and it's 3d10 on a failed save."
"Brennan: One of them succeeds. Do they take half, or no?"
Murph: They half as much on a successful-- one.
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Whoops. 12, 17."
"Brennan: 17 to each of them, okay."
"Lou: Yum, yum."
"Ally: Yum, yum"
Siobhan: Spicy spicy.
Lou: Well that's a tasty amount of damage.
"Brennan: You guys see that Kugrash reaches out a hand and the third rail leaps into life and off the third rail, [crackling] they're all electrocuted over there. That's Kugrash, that's gonna be Pete."
"Ally: Okay, cool, I'm gonna, I'm still like holding the gray baby, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, you are."
"Ally: Okay, I'm gonna get closer into the middle of the cluster of everybody."
Lou: That's a good call.
"Brennan: Okay, are you gonna move away from this dude?"
"Zac: Those guys are fleeing, right?"
"Emily: Yeah, they're fleeing."
"Brennan: They are fleeing, they're under his attacks, yep."
Emily: Haha
Brennan: So you're gonna move closer to Kingston here?
"Ally: More like in the middle, like behind everybody. Yeah, yeah, perfect."
Brennan: Dope.
Emily: Near Ox.
"Ally: And then I'm gonna give Alejandro again my Shield, like reaction attack and then also a second level spell 'cause I ran out of firsts, so two."
"Brennan: Or you gonna give him, okay, so you're gonna give him a bonus and a first level, gotcha."
Ally: Or like a reaction and a first level.
"Brennan: Gotcha, cool cool. Yeah, you see that you are just, you see this wizard trying to do this high intellectual arcane abstract thing and he's just got so much math and geometry in his head trying to summon this train and you like put out a hand an this twisting feels like a weird umbilical cord made out of pastel light shoots out of your hand into his navel and his [sputtering], he just starts casting more and more magic as you're taking your full round to give him magical power. That's going to be, no train that round. These guys go, that guys gonna take a swing at your rats there."
Lou: Long live the rats.
Ally: Honestly.
Brennan: He deals 30 points of damage to the rats.
"Murph: Yeah, he's gone. I think that was one of the hurt ones. I think there's a hurt and a healthy one over there."
Brennan: The guy in the back is gonna take a swing and miss. He misses your rats. These rats that killed Epona are--
Murph: Are awesome.
Brennan: Are the most fearsome rats that there have ever been.
"Emily: Yeah, they're gonna come get wrapped around my hands."
Brennan: These guys take a full round to flee in both of these directions over here. This guy's gonna take a swing at Ricky. Hits.
Zac: Damn.
"Ally: Oh, can I do. No, I already, yeah nevermind. Gave all of my shit to Alejandro."
"Zac: I'm getting, this might take me down."
Emily: Really?
Zac: I'm at 24.
"Brennan: That's gonna be 14, 17, 19, 22"
"Zac: Okay, I'm at 2."
Brennan: I'm gonna need that constitution saving throw.
[groaning]
Zac: Okay.
Murph: Praise the juicy cockroach.
"Zac: So, I would add, I'm gonna add--"
Siobhan: I would like to do Cunning Words at that--
Brennan: At that moment?
Siobhan: Can I do that?
"Brennan: Yes actually 'cause it, well hold on. On your turn, no, yeah your turn-- refreshed,"
Siobhan: it's a reaction.
"Brennan: You have a reaction, yeah you can do that."
"Siobhan: I say to him,"
Misty: I've watched enough episodes of SVU to know this is not how you be a cop.
"Brennan: I'll tell you right now, he hit a 22 against Ricky's AC. What's your AC, it's--"
"Zac: 20, yeah."
Brennan: So if you roll a 3 or higher this is prevented.
Siobhan: That is a 6.
[cheering]
"Brennan: You see that as you, as you say that, ""I've seen enough SVU"" and you guys hear reverberated through the entire station you hear [Law & Order bell sound] And he stumbles and misses and Ricky is safe, you do not take any of that damage."
Zac: Thanks.
Brennan: Incredible! Has Misty saved like Ricky's life—
Zac: Wouldn't be a fight if Misty didn't save me every single time.
Ally: You would have had max— health two.
"Zac: Max two, yeah."
Ally: If you failed that constitution.
Misty: He's just such a sweet boy. I have to look after and mother him.
Brennan: One's gonna take a swing at Sofia. Does a 19 hit Sofia?
"Emily: Yeah, it does."
"Brennan: Sofia you're gonna take, I'm gonna-- need that--"
Emily: Seriously fucked me up.
Brennan: Constitution saving throw.
Emily: I wanna be fucked up.
"Lou: Yeah, you were so excited."
Emily: I wanna get fucked up so that my shit gets magical.
"Brennan: 27, you take 30 points of damage."
"Emily: Yeah, bitch."
Zac: So that's magic time.
"Brennan: Now what we have to see though is if your, 'cause if your max is reduced your ability won't activate. So you need to—"
"Ally: Oh, because it's half?"
Brennan: Because it's half of your HP.
"Emily: No, but it says, if wearer is less than 10 HP."
"Brennan: Oh, less than, okay."
"Emily: Okay, but I wouldn't be at, but I might. And I mean I might honestly just go down. So this is a constitution saving throw?"
Brennan: Yes.
Zac: You're within 10 feet--
"Emily: I'm gonna go ahead and-- Oh, really?"
"Zac: So you have my charisma, you add 3 to it."
"Emily: Okay, does a 15 save?"
Brennan: A 15 does save.
Emily: Yeah!
Brennan: You see that you guys are on the other side of Misty with her like rapier out and you feel Ricky's Mr. March. You see that there's like a bit of sweat on Ricky's brow as he—
"Sofia: Oh my God, if the girls at the salon could see this."
"Brennan: Okay, so your hit points are, what are you at HP wise?"
Emily: So I'm at 10. So I can't get 1d8 because it's not less than 10 but now I get 1d4 radiant damage.
Brennan: You do get 1d4 radiant damage on everything.
"Emily: And then on everything, so then now are all my attacks or do I still have to try and make rat nunchucks?"
Brennan: You do not have to try and make rat nunchucks now. If you don’t—
"Emily: So now I can, okay."
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: Cool, that's going to be. That's incredible."
"Emily: Good, that's what I wanna do. Thank you for doing that."
Brennan: These two come for Kingston.
Siobhan: Fuck 'em up Kingston.
Lou: We'll see.
"Brennan: These two reach out for you [gasping] you square your stance and you watch as they leap and you guys all, anyone looking in that direction for even a moment see the entire platform telescope out infinitely like that camera move and these two cannot reach Kingston no matter how hard they try. [whooshing] that is going to be Ricky. That's you my man."
"Zac: Okay, can I also, can I just for the bonus action of Shield of Faith, it doesn't mean like, for a paladin I can just keep using it, right? Like I don't necessarily have to have it."
Brennan: You need to be burning slots to do it.
"Zac: Yes, just okay then."
"Brennan: But yeah, if you're just giving it to Alejandro you can keep burning."
"Zac: Yeah, I'll do that and then I'm just going to attack the one in my face that has been hurting me so much."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Okay, great. Does a 17 hit?"
Brennan: 17 hits.
"Zac: 'Kay, and then more than that so, okay."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Zac: 9 plus 13, so 22."
Brennan: That guy’s looking very fucked up but still standing.
Zac: Damn
[whipping sounds]
"Brennan: That's going to, that's Ricky. I don't think they're, oh you have those two rats left so you're rats are still going."
"Murph: Sweet, go after the same guy. No good."
"Brennan: Cool [hissing], that specter, again no faces but you can tell he's confused by how badly this is going for him. That's gonna be Sofia."
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: You guys see Sofia gets hit bad by one of these specters and the ring on her finger from the bodega [chimes] glows—
"Emily: I definitely look up, have maybe cat eyes."
Brennan: Yeah.
Emily: And like get amped. There's like some blood-- coming down.
Lou: Get amped.
"Brennan: You guys see huge, soft, fuzzy paws made of like, they're kind of like, if they were made of spectral light, but they're partially transparent ghostly. Or you know like in, when there's like a partially spectral translucent effect but they're kind of like those novelty Hulk hands but cat paws appear on Sofia's hands."
"Siobhan: Oh my god, that's so cool."
"Emily: And, wait I'm gonna add bardic inspiration to this one. Okay, it didn't-- do it."
Brennan: It's d8 not d6.
"Emily: Oh, right! Okay, so this one is gonna be 17, that is gonna hit. This one's gonna be 14-- is that gonna hit?"
Brennan: 14 hits.
"Emily: Okay, so they both hit."
Zac: Nice.
"Emily: So that's 9, and another 7 and then I'm gonna Flurry Blows 'cause you got to. And does a 13 hit?"
Brennan: 13 hits.
"Emily: Okay, then it's gonna be 7 and 6."
"Brennan: Remind me of that damage, so 7 and 6 plus what else?"
"Emily: 7, 6."
"Lou: 7, 9?"
"Emily: 7, 9."
"Brennan: 7, 6, 7, 9, so that's 14, 20, 29."
Emily: And this time it's magical!
Zac: And then you add your radiant.
Brennan: You add radiant to all of those.
"Emily: Oh, every single one of those?"
Brennan: Every single one.
"Emily: 1, 5, 9 and 13."
"Brennan: You guys see-- [wooshing, screeching and punching sounds] You rend this crooked cop, asunder, [screaming] gray steam shoots out of where the mouth on it would be and it is destroyed. [screeching]"
Emily: I want it to be that cat growl like at the beginning of that Ratatat song.
Ally: Oh yeah.
Emily: You guys know what I'm talking about?
Ally pretends to play the drums.
"Brennan: Yeah. Incredible, you feel deep in your heart [purring]."
"Emily: God, I'm purring."
"Brennan: Incredible, Kingston, that's gonna be you."
"Lou: So I'll give a bonus, we're doing a thing where we, it's like I'm gonna give the bonus word, bonus action, Healing Word to Alejandro and then cast another second Command, second level Command on the two in front of me."
Brennan: God damn.
Kingston: Flee. There you go.
"Brennan: Uh, flee. They dare not question you as they turn to run. That's going to be, that's Kingston, Pizza Rat."
Murph: Can I talk to Pi—
"Kugrash: Hey, what ya got there?"
"Brennan: Pete, as you see Kugrash talking to this thing you look over and remember the little Pizza Rat from the very first time you went into Dream. Goes,"
"Pizza Rat: [high voice] Oh, hi there, hi Kugrash. I, I'm a little bit lost. I think I ended up in the waking world. I'm trying to get back to Dream."
Pete: Oh.
"Brennan: You all hear this rat talk by the way, not only, this rat's speaking English."
"Kugrash: If we eat the pizza can we go back, or do you want to just come back with us?"
Pizza Rat: You catching the train?
Kugrash: Yeah.
Pete: Yeah.
"Pizza Rat: Yeah, I'll get a ride. What's these guys’ problems?"
"Pete: Oh yeah, we're in the middle of a huge battle."
"Pizza Rat: Gotcha, right, right, right, I hear you. Okay, I'll help."
Pete: Great.
"Kugrash: Yeah, I mean don't get yourself killed. A lot of rats have died today."
"Pizza Rat: Okay, well, they weren't a Pizza Rat."
Pete: Wow.
"Kingston: Fair, Pizza Rat, fair."
Emily: He casts a 9th level hail of doom.
"Brennan: Yeah, fucking Meteor Swarm."
Lou: Banishment motherfucker.
Brennan: Epic level spells.
Emily: He summons a little T. Rex.
"Ally: [pretending to be Pizza Rat] You weren't a Pizza Rat, T. Everyone bursts into flames."
"Brennan: [deep voice] ""I am Pizza Rat."""
Emily: [pretending to be Pizza Rat] Kill the good alongside evil.
"Brennan: Misty, that's gonna be you."
"Siobhan: I've already used my bonus action this turn, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, you have."
Zac: To help me.
"Siobhan: So what I'm gonna do is use, give Counterspell to Alejandro which is a reaction."
"Brennan: Cool. Oh, wait did you use your reaction, oh so--"
"Siobhan: It's a bonus action, not a reaction."
"Brennan: Cool, great."
"Siobhan: I believe, I could be wrong."
"Brennan: No, Counterspells are reaction. But, you could wait 'til his turn and give it to him."
"Siobhan: Oh, okay, then I'll do that."
"Brennan: Yeah, same difference."
Siobhan: And then I'm gonna cast Vicious Mockery on the guy in front of Ricky.
"Brennan: Cool, awesome."
"Siobhan: Which, so I'm gonna say,"
Misty: Don't you need to take a fitness test to be a cop?
"Brennan: Oh, great, what's the—"
Emily: Oh Misty!
Siobhan: And then it's 2d4 psychic damage
Brennan: Go ahead and roll it. Fails.
"Siobhan: Oh yes, a Wisdom saving throw, and it's 4 damage."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: Better than nothing, but he also has disadvantage on his next—"
Brennan: Attack roll.
"Siobhan: His next, yes, his next attack roll."
Murph: That’s crucial.
"Brennan: You look like you attacking this cop probably looks, feels uncomfortable in the weird smoke body that he has and you've really fucked him up, his confidence is shaken. Just here with these barbed words, acid tongued Misty Moore."
Siobhan: So mean.
"Brennan: Cool, it's Alejandro's turn--"
Ally: Let's do it.
Brennan: Once more.
"Emily: Okay, what to we gotta roll, 16 this time?"
Ally: 17.
Brennan: I've written down that you guys have given five spells this turn.
Zac: I gave mine.
"Murph: Yah, I gave one."
Emily: I have none to give.
"Ally: Yah, I have two."
"Brennan: Yep, Pete's given two."
Emily: Gave my only slot.
Brennan: We're rolling six die.
"Zac: One, two, three, four, five, six."
Siobhan: And we have to get a 17 or above?
Brennan: 17 or above now.
"Ally: Oh did you get my, I think I gave two."
"Brennan: You gave two, yep."
Ally: I think we miscounted 'cause we have six.
"Brennan: Oh, you guys have six. I have, how many did you give?"
Zac: I gave one.
Brennan: One.
Lou: Healing word.
Brennan: One.
Murph: I thought I did Healing word.
"Brennan: Oh yeah, sorry I didn't write down, yeah you did Healing Word as well. Oh no, did you use your bonus action to not trans…"
"Siobhan: Oh, you couldn't because you were Wild Shaped."
"Brennan: That's right, so you get two, you each get one. And we're rolling 17 or higher does it. Okay, let's do it."
They roll in the Box of Doom. None of the dice are high enough.
Siobhan: Did we do it?
"Lou: 15, 14—"
Emily: Are you kidding me?
"Ally: 15, 14"
Siobhan: Fuck sake. Oh my God-- this is so frustrating.
Ally: I'm running out-- of spell slots.
"Siobhan: Yeah, me too."
Ally: Fucker.
Murph: Everybody just do two this time.
Emily: I am so--
Zac: I only have one spell slot left.
Ally: Yeah.
Zac: I'm so mad-- that I used my spell on the d20 thing.
"Brennan: Yeah, Alejandro's like, trying he's like"
"Alejandro: This, the infrastructure, we need to invest in the infrastructure."
"Ally: We can just all like quickly use our turn and be like, give a slot, give a slot, give a, and quickly roll again."
Emily: Can I give him a...
Misty: When I get back I'm donating to De Blasio's campaign so we can have a goddamn word with him.
Emily: Can I give him a ki point on my turn?
Brennan: I'm afraid that won't do it.
Emily: Okay. Rat nunchucks it is.
"Lou: You keep kicking ass, we’ill keep giving spells."
"Brennan: Kugrash, it's gonna be you."
"Murph: Action spell, bonus action spell. That's all of mine."
"Brennan: That's your full turn, all right."
"Murph: That's my full turn. And I guess, I'll get in between, just in case anybody comes for Pete and the little baby, I'll get behind—"
Lou: The gray baby?
"Emily: No need to worry about Ox, I got him."
"Brennan: Incredible, you guys see, yeah you start pouring slick, you get these weird helix of dream energy. You just start pouring a stream of smoke and grime also going into Alejandro's tummy. He goes like [groaning], as he's being filled with everyone's magic."
Lou: Ew.
"Brennan: Pete, that's your turn."
"Ally: Yeah, I give Alejandro a second level slot 'cause I'm out of firsts and then I open up mind link with Kingston but in that way that like, you know when you call someone and it's really loaded and you both just sit there silently but you're on the phone together. Like he knows I've accessed his mind and we're both just kind of like sitting in silence."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Ally: If you want to say something, the channel is open."
Brennan: No trains this round either.
Lou: Don’t do this to me.
"Emily: And he just saw his fucking ex-wife today, oh wait, I guess it's not today."
Siobhan: This week still.
"Lou: It's been a tough, yesterday was, it's been a tough couple of days."
Emily: Yeah. It’s so rough.
"Brennan: These guys vanish. You see two more of these guys appear, one here and one here and they one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight--"
"Emily: Ricky, I feel compelled to come help you instead of helping your dog."
"Zac: I feel like, save the dog."
Emily: I know.
"Brennan: These two start rushing towards you, this guy's going to engage with Kingston."
"Lou: Pizza Rat, does he enter Pizza Rat’s threatened area?"
Emily: Please tell me he takes auto crit?
Zac: He slips on a piece of pizza.
"Lou: Yeah, does he slip on Pizza Rat’s pizza?"
"Ally: Yeah, the green slime that's like been left."
"Lou: Yeah, those stairs can't be easy to-- walk down."
"Zac: He's like, his clown legs--"
Brennan: 28 damage to the injured rats over there.
Murph: He gone.
"Brennan: He gone, baby."
Murph: Fought so well.
Ally: Yeah.
"Emily: They really did. They did magical damage, that's huge."
"Brennan: Kingston, this one reaches you. You feel yourself momentarily distracted by Pete's mind link."
"Ally: Fuck, I'm sorry."
"Brennan: And he dishes 14, 19, plus 3, 22 points of damage to Kingston."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I once again would like to, excuse me."
"Brennan: Yes, sorry."
Siobhan: Make fun of these terrible cops.
"Brennan: Okay, your AC—"
Lou: Is 18.
"Brennan: Is 18, this thing got a 25."
Siobhan: Oh.
Brennan: So you need to roll an 8.
"Siobhan: I'm gonna give it a go, why not."
"Lou: This is, my heart is racing."
"Misty: Oh, you think you're so big you need to have a gun?"
"Siobhan: No, it's a 1."
[groaning]
Murph: He does have a gun.
"Emily: You guys both had like a big reaction, I was like this is great or bad--"
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: What is it?
Lou: I'm down.
"Brennan: Have you used a reaction spell to Alejandro? So that was, 22 right?"
"Lou: Yes, I'm down."
Brennan: Give me a Constitution save.
Lou: Great. That’s going to be 16.
"Brennan: You succeed, Kingston falls as this specter reaches in. That's going to be, your HP max is not reduced, but you are down. That one takes him and this one's going to go for Ricky."
"Zac: He's got disadvantage, correct?"
"Brennan: He does. One of those was a nat 20, and the other one very much was not."
Siobhan: Thank fucking god.
[clapping]
"Brennan: Takes a swing, misses. That is going to be Ricky."
"Zac: All right, going to use my last spell slot bonus action to give Alejandro a spell and then, fuck, I guess I just gotta kill the one in front of me. 'cause it's supposedly low. 11 does not hit, right?"
Brennan: 11 does not.
"Zac: Okay, and 12 doesn't hit?"
Brennan: 12 doesn't hit either.
Zac: Can I use my last luck point?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
"Zac: Okay, please, okay 15?"
Brennan: 15 hits.
Ally: Nice.
Zac: 18 plus 8. Please die.
Emily: Please die.
Lou: Please die.
"Brennan: He does not go down. [slicing] You take a swing, you’re feeling—"
Zac: Can I take like a five foot step this way?
Brennan: He'll get an attack of opportunity if you do that.
"Zac: Oh, yeah okay, nevermind."
Brennan: That's going to be--
"Zac: Oh and then Ox, can I have--"
"Emily: No, keep him safe, he's only got 2 hit points."
Zac: I know but he can come back to life.
Murph: He's made of light.
Zac: Ox is gonna go up through this area to attack.
"Brennan: There and attack, cool. And he gets advantage 'cause he's--"
"Zac: He gets an advantage, right?"
"Brennan: Yep, he does."
Zac: And his attack is plus 4 to hit so...
Emily: Ooh!
Zac: 19
Brennan: Roll again to see if you crit.
"Zac: Yeah, so 19 plus,"
Brennan: hits.
Zac: Plus 4 so2 d4.
Ally: Nice.
Zac: Plus two—
Emily: Ox.
"Zac: It's 2, 3 plus 5."
Ally: Cool.
[exclaiming]
"Ricky: Good dog, good boy."
"Brennan: Ox reaches up [chomping] and you see, as it sinks incredible blinding light issues from his like mouth as though there was like a spotlight in his throat and sears this shadow cop away. Incredible."
"Emily: Oh wait, he's just a steed that you summon."
Zac: Yeah.
"Emily: So, if he dies—"
Zac: I think I just summon him again.
"Brennan: The last of the rat army, it's their turn."
Murph: Let's go after this one guy.
Emily: I was so worried about defending him.
Zac: I appreciate it.
"[Emily laughs, rolling her eyes a little]"
"Murph: Hell yeah, 18."
Brennan: That hits.
Murph: 10.
Ally: Yeah!
Brennan: Fuck yeah.
"Lou: Get it, rats."
"Brennan: This guy's so fucked up, just by rats— [laughing] he's injured, he's badly hurt by rats. Excellent, Sofia that's you."
"Emily: All right I'm just gonna, I can't do anything else so I'm just gonna run forward and try and finish this guy off."
Brennan: Go for it.
"Emily: I'm guessing 21 hits, and 17 hits?"
"Brennan: 17 hits, yeah."
"Emily: So that’s, hold up, I forgot, when they roll. 21 and then..."
Brennan: 21 damage.
"Emily: I'm going to do another 6, so that's 27 and then fuck it I'll Flurry of Blows one final time. Does a 12 hit, no it doesn't. Whatever."
Brennan: And roll your radiant damage for all of those.
"Emily: Oh, yeah."
"Brennan: So, 4d4. 5."
"Emily: 5, 6."
"Brennan: 6, cool. This guy's looking extremely hurt over by the rats, on death's door. That's Sofia, Kingston I am going to need a death saving throw."
Zac: I still have—
Lou: 2.
Zac: Lay on Hands.
"Ally: Can I use my Tides of Chaos? Which is one advantage on one roll one time of day to give to him, or is that only my own roll?"
"Brennan: I will allow you to do Tides of Chaos. Let me see what the, know what, for this one, because of how important it is in the story, I will allow you to re-roll that."
Zac: What did he get?
Lou: I got a 2.
Brennan: And you take the higher roll.
Lou: That's a 3.
"Brennan: 3, cool. But you feel yourself, you feel your spirit as you look up and can feel the coldness weighing in on you and you feel something in this spectral gray as you hear voices around you. You feel a hand take your hand in the darkness and you can feel Pete through the mist."
"Kingston: Oh, oh, oh."
"Pete: Fuck, fuck man."
[exclaiming]
Lou: Pizza Rat.
"Brennan: Pizza Rat goes up here, leaps up, and feeds a little bit of pizza to Alejandro."
Pizza Rat: Eat some pizza.
"Alejandro: What? Why do, [gagging]"
Brennan: And feeds a little bit of pizza in there.
"Ally: Rat, a little rat paw with pizza."
"Brennan: Misty, that's gonna be you."
Emily: Do you have heals?
"Siobhan: I do, I'm gonna go over to. I was gonna leave it for Ricky but I don't feel like Misty can leave Kingston just lying on the floor over there. I'm gonna go over to Kingston and cast Cure Wounds."
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: Yes.
"Siobhan: Okay, for 1d... it's 4 plus 7, 13? No, 11? 11."
Lou: Thank you.
Ally: Nice.
"Brennan: Kingston, so you feel Pete's hand and Misty, you come over to Kingston, your old friend."
"Siobhan: And I'm like,"
"Misty: Get up, old man."
"Brennan: You come up back to your feet. Or, I guess your prone and will use your movement to come back to your feet."
Siobhan: And then I'd like to give my final Counterspell to Alejandro.
Ally: This fuckin' better work. We're all like fully out of spells.
Brennan: I have five spells going to Alejandro this round. You need a 16 or higher.
Ally: I’m one.
Siobhan: I am going to use a different die.
Murph: I have two.
Ally: You’re two. One.
"Brennan: Remember how many, let's see."
"Lou: Go get ‘em, guys."
"Brennan: So, he has one of his own, one, two, three, four, five."
Siobhan: We have to get a 16?
Emily: 16 or higher.
Brennan: 16.
Murph: Can Pizza Rat help at all?
"Ally: Yeah, what was that bite of pizza about?"
"Brennan: Oh sorry, he gets advantage on his roll from the pizza. So we're looking for a 16 or higher."
Ally: 12.
Lou: No fucking way.
Zac: 20!
Ally: 20!
"[exclaiming, triumphant music]"
Emily: It was one of the Pizza Rat ones.
Ally: Ah! Pizza Rat.
"Brennan: Everyone, everyone take your dice back. Yeah, that was Pizza Rat’s die."
Ally: Oh my God.
Pizza Rat: Slow and steady wins the race.
Brennan: Incredible guys.
Siobhan: Oh my goodness.
Emily: I guess he was as powerful as we joked.
Brennan: Holy shit--
Ally: He's just slowly--
Brennan: Was there only one plus 16 rolled?
Murph: Yeah
Ally: Yes and it was that one. And it was a nat 20.
"Lou: We are worthless, Pizza Rat--"
"Ally: We were only at our own dice, too."
Siobhan: Yeah. Oh its so sick.
"Emily: Ohh, trippy."
Siobhan: It's got little eyes.
"Brennan: You see going in the direction of further into Brooklyn but on the wrong side of the track. So, topsy turvy, very strange and wonderful. Nod- bound L train approaches and pulls into the station. One door slides open and you see it says ""Next stop, Nod."" and all of you see this train pull into the station, Alejandro like collapses with exhaustion and that's going to go to the top of the order and be Kugrash."
"Murph: Sweet. I am going to,"
Siobhan: [whispering] Get on the fucking train.
"Murph: Yeah, I'm going to. I think I'm gonna turn into a bear, so that I can grab--"
"Siobhan: Oh, sick."
Murph: I can grab Pete and the kid and run towards the subway.
"Brennan: Cool, give me an athletics check in your bear form--"
"Murph: Sweet, with advantage 'cause of the juicy cockroach."
Brennan: 'Cause of this juicy fucking cockroach.
Murph: So juicy.
Brennan: This cockroach has been here for a full minute just flexing.
"Cockroach: [flexing] Oh, yeah."
"Murph: What is my strength as a bear? Oh, I rolled a natural 17."
"Brennan: Oh, yes, great. You scoop Pete and Nod up. And you rush into the train. I'm gonna go ahead, actually, and remove our little--"
Murph: Yah.
"Lou: Oh, the top comes off?"
Brennan pops the top off of the train mini.
"Emily: Ohh, its so fun."
Brennan: Thank you. Boom.
Emily: What a train.
Siobhan: Pink seats.
Emily: It kind of looks like a bachelorette party bus.
Ally: Oh my god. Totally.
"Siobhan: Like you get on the wrong car in the train and you're like ah, fuck, I'm on this fucking—"
"Brennan: As a good New Yorker you move far into the car as you enter rather then just hanging out by the door. [stares threateningly into the camera and points at the viewer] Go further in the car! You rush in, you have Pete and Nod. You lay Nod down on the train. You see the face on the front of the train starts to move and go"
"Train: [cartoonish cheerful voice] Hey, everybody, let's take a little trip to Dreamland. Slumber, slumber, z-z-z."
"Brennan: And that's Kugrash's turn, Pete that's your turn."
"Ally: I'm already in, I'm good."
"Brennan: Cool. You still have line of sight to the madness going on out there, but you also have like Nod to contend with here in the train as well."
"Ally: Can I, I just wanna roll an Investigate check on what my golden grill does?"
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: That I found.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: 10, oh wait wait, no 11."
"Brennan: 11, it's some kind of goofy magic. You don't think it would help in a fight though."
"Ally: Okay, cool."
"Brennan: That's Pete. Baddies, this guy’s going to, close in. This guy comes right through the roof. [all make sounds of dismay] Into the car. This guy in through here, let me see, he was like over here right so it's one, two, three, yeah, comes over here. This guy's gonna take a swing at Sofia."
Emily: Bring it on.
Brennan: That's a miss. He's gonna take a swing at Kingston. That's a miss. And the two in here are both gonna take swings at Pete.
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Brennan: One hits, Pete you take, 7, 9, 16, you take 20 points of damage."
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: As one of them hits you there,"
"Ally: Constitution, or?"
"Brennan: Yeah, give me that Constitution save."
"Ally: 11, oh no sorry, more."
Murph: 13.
Ally: 13.
"Brennan: Oh, you got a full 13?"
Ally: Yeah.
Murph: 11 plus 2.
"Brennan: 11 plus 2? Oh, rad, okay yeah. [looking at Ally’s sheet] No wait your Constitution save—"
"Ally: Oh no, yah, it's way higher. Yeah, 16."
"Brennan: Yeah, your HP max, you take the damage but your HP max is not reduced. That is now going to be, that's one, two, three, four, that he goes and attacks, you also see two more appear over here."
Zac: They all gotta go.
Brennan: Two more appear over here. That's going to be Ricky.
"Zac: Okay, Ricky, and Ox are gonna run onto the train."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: And on the train Ricky's gonna cast Suggestion on this one.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Oh, 'cause it's his weapons thing. And tell him to,"
"Ricky: Hey, they want you at the station."
Brennan: Cool. He goes [gasping] and does not move.
"Zac: No, okay. Well, okay, that takes my action right?"
"Brennan: That's your action, yeah."
"Zac: Okay, so the other, so Ox is gonna attack the one closest to him. And he has advantage on it 'cause he's next to it now."
"Brennan: Great, go for it."
Zac: 19.
Brennan: That's gonna hit.
"Zac: So, let's see, d4?"
Brennan: 2d4 plus 1.
"Zac: 4, 4."
"Ally: Hey, fuck yeah."
"Zac: Plus 2, actually."
"Brennan: Oh yeah, reach up and bites that specter there. Yeah, Ox attacks that creature, that's gonna be the rats yet again."
"Murph: Hell yeah, come on after this rats."
"Lou: Kill him, kill him rats."
Emily: Finish off this guy. Finish him.
Murph: 14?
Brennan: 14 hits.
[royal music]
"Lou: Rats, do it rats."
Murph: 6.
Ally: Yeah.
"Lou: Come on, rats."
Emily: Is he still standing there?
Brennan: You gotta be fucking kidding me. [takes the mini off the board]
Ally: Yeah!
"Rats: To arm, to arms my brothers!"
Murph: This is insane.
Lou: Big kills for the rats.
"Brennan: The rats turn to you as they envelop this cop and shred it apart and you see that they seem to be doing it because the onyx badge is there. They seem to suck this cop by the badge. They go,"
"Rats: Safe voyage king. May our kingdom live long. For the rats, the rats of the city salute you!"
"Brennan: And you see that one of them in front says,"
"Rats: The battle is not yet over. Let our king retreat while we hold the line. And though we die, he yet lives."
Brennan: And they turn to—
Kugrash: You brave bastards.
"Brennan: Sofia, that's you."
"Emily: All right, I'm fuckin' runnin' right into this, kickin in', what time is it, it's show time. Flurry of Blows on someone. I'm doin' a little swing around and then Flurry of Blows in."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: Okay, that's gonna hit, a 21, another 21."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: Let's see, 8 plus 12, 20, plus 28 and not I have to do, that's with my radiant damage and now I have to do my—"
Brennan: Your flurry.
Emily: My other.
Brennan: You have ki points left or no?
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Okay, cool."
"Emily: Okay, those both hit."
Zac: Oh my God.
"Emily: So, 16, 19, 20. No, so 20, 48."
Brennan: Woo!
Murph: What?
[blows landing]
"Brennan: This guy is on death's door and one set of attacks, see Ox bites him, you come in and swing show time--"
"Sofia: [clapping rhythmically] What time is it? It's showtime. What time is it, it's showtime. what time is it?"
The whole cast claps along with her.
Siobhan: I use Minor Illusion to create a boom box.
"Brennan: As every New Yorker’s worst fear, getting kicked in the face by a show time dancer--"
Emily: I would like to say that all of this happened while I was like doing B-boy moves.
[punching noises]
"Brennan: That guy is badly, badly hurt. Kingston, that is you."
Lou: Can I see the guys in the train?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
"Lou: Can I cast a third level Command on all three, the one in front of me and then the two in the train?"
Brennan: Yes you can.
Zac: Sheesh.
Ally: Yeah.
Siobhan: Already tired of these fucking ghosts.
Brennan: What do you say to them?
Kingston: Get out of here.
[whooshing]
Lou: And then I'll use my movement to get on the train.
Zac: Can you scoop the Pizza Rat?
"Lou: Oh, you know I scoop Pizza Rat."
Emily: Yeah!
Brennan: You scoop Pizza Rat.
Ally: Cute.
"Brennan: [cute little voice] He's on a little bench next to you. [normal] You get on the train. That's Kingston, Pizza Rat that's his turn. Misty, that's gonna be you."
"Siobhan: I'm gonna get on the goddamn train. There's not really much I can do. I guess I'll cast, I mean they're running away, right? And we're gonna just be on the train? I'll cast now the Cure Wounds on Kingston, why not? Is everybody else, how's everybody else doing?"
"Emily: I’m at 10, but I am fine to be there for a bit."
Sofia: Right 'cause it's like giving you magical abilities?
Ally: Yeah.
Siobhan: Yeah so I'll cast another cure wounds on Kingston. For 8.
Lou: 8?
Siobhan: Better than nothing.
Emily: I need to get a little more fucked up to get magic.
"Brennan: Incredible, Misty jumps on the train, you know your boy Alejandro jumps onto the train."
Lou: What about the juicy cockroach?
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: He just like gets on something.
Siobhan: As a bonus action can you move…
Murph: He is not going to be fast enough.
Brennan: That is going to be back to Kugrash.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: You look and see that the two spectral police officers look like they've been abjured by Kingston.
Murph: Okay.
Zac: How do we get this train out of here?
"Murph: Yeah, can I—"
"Emily: Yeah, just like—"
Siobhan: We just can.
Kugrash: Can we go?
"Brennan: Cool, you, boom. Pete you also have an action if you want to do anything here. Or you can just wait for the, you know."
Ally: To get my gun and I shoot Kingston's leg.
Siobhan: What are you thinking?
"Brennan: You also have been, have you just been giving—"
Ally: I'm kidding.
"Brennan: Oh, that's very funny."
"Lou laughs, very loudly and aggressively, offended."
Brennan: And I am going to need wild magic from the last two rounds.
"Ally: Oh, if I've been giving my spell slots?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I think it's still an act of magic."
"Ally rolls their die, then looks up with an “oh shit” expression, then back down, grinning."
Murph: Two.
Ally: Fuck.
"Emily: Watch this be the first time it's ever something bad. So far it's always like, defeat your enemies!"
Ally: And it's like the gun that shoots Kingston.
"Siobhan: Fireball, we are all so close to you, fuck man."
Emily: The first time ever it fucks us over.
"Brennan: Oh, baby, incredible. Well, one second."
Lou: The amount of time that we're all just sitting here—
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
"Lou: I shoot Kingston, there's no, Brennan wasn't moving forward. You weren't saying anything else, so I was like, okay, Pizza Rat?"
Brennan: Pizza Rat help.
"Lou: Pizza Rat help me, Pizza Rat save me."
Ally: Pizza Rat jumps in front of your legs.
Siobhan: I am really worried how concentrated he is right now.
"Brennan: I have to read this, this is from the table. A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in a space within five feet of you then disappears one minute later. The unicorn from the moon bridge appears."
[upbeat electronic music]
"Ally: Oh, cool."
"Brennan: And goes,"
"Unicorn: [Southern accent] Hey sugar, you want this train to move? Let's kick it into top gear, what do you say?"
"Ally: I say,"
"Pete: Yeah, let's do it."
"Unicorn: Hell yeah, brother, let's do this!"
"Brennan: And you see, you hear,"
"Train Message: Stand clear of the closing doors, please."
"Brennan: [whooshing] The train rockets these two both disappear, incorporeally. Yet, you see that these rats charge as all these specters go and “Charge of the Light Brigade”. You, Kugrash, hear sorrowful music."
Murph: [reaches out] One bear paw on the glass.
"Ally: Aw, you're a bear."
"[slow, somber music]"
[sad bear groaning]
"Brennan: And the train rockets off with unicorn magic faster than you've ever seen a New York City subway move. As you race into Brooklyn. We are out of combat, and [the lights in the background flash] the train moves station after station until you stop recognizing the names. The tracks begin to buckle and bend and all of a sudden you're not under ground anymore. You're far far up in the sky in a roller coaster [roller coaster noises] of the train. You see a New York unlike any you've ever seen before. Snow swirls up from the ground and into the sky and a normally starless New York City sky is now filled with stars. Strange constellations, bright and wondrous that you've never seen. As the train moves you see on the bench next to you, Nod, the orphan of dreams, opens their mouth, [gasps] breaths."
"Zac: I have my, like, CPR mask."
Ally: It's like as big as its face.
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: Alejandro sits on a bench just sweating. [pants] Pizza Rat goes,"
"Pizza Rat: Oh good, we're here, great."
"Brennan: Bing, the doors open."
"Pizza Rat: All right, I'm home, see you guys, Pete, thanks for the ride, kid."
"Pete: Yeah, of course."
"Brennan: You see Alejandro says,"
"Alejandro: [offended] Thanks to the rat, I summoned the train?"
"Brennan: And then Pizza Rat moseys out but you see this is the last stop on the line so the train is actually going to be here for a few minutes, you've reached the end of the line. Looking out again it is a chilly night but it is not freezing cold. Instead it is a cold that is otherworldly. It's the first blast of winter air that makes you [little gasp] wake up and feel alive coming in from the dream realm. And as you look out and you see no pavement or sidewalk but just a little whisper of mist covering the ground as though you were walking on the surface of a cloud, out there in the dream land, minds of sleeping people cavort and laugh and make merry but also scheme and fear and dread. This is a realm of pure magic. Beyond the ken of the mortal world. As the train stops you hear a voice from the front of the train go,"
"Train: [smarmy] Well, we're here gang. You're welcome to sleep on our fuzzy seats but if you like you can also go out and find big old bakeries full of dream pies. And those buns you like, Misty Moore!"
Emily: I'm walkin' out.
"Siobhan: I mean, I'm going out. I've never even,"
"Misty: I've been in New York for, it's been a long time since I've been to Nod."
Zac: I think I step on the cloud just to make sure it's safe.
"Ricky: Come on guys, it's all right, it's okay."
Siobhan: I touch Ricky's very juicy arms as I step down.
Ricky: What's that?
Siobhan: To retend I'm like frailer than I am so I can grope him a little bit.
"Ricky: Okay, yes, yes ma’am."
"Emily: Me too, me too."
Lou: Do I still have my mind link open?
Brennan: I didn't hear Pete cancel it.
"Lou: As we walk off the train, I make eye contact with Pete and in my mind say,"
Kingston: I owe you an explanation and an apology.
"Ally: I'm holding the baby and I'm like,"
"Pete: Okay, before we go any further,"
"Ally: I like step off too, but,"
Pete: I want to hear what's going on.
"Brennan: You see that Nod wakens in your arms. And this strange alien child with jet black eyes and gray skin that is the spirit of all the lost children that have ever lived in New York whispers up to you as they awake and says,"
"Nod: All can be explained. All can be answered here. While you walk in the sixth borough, you walk with my blessing. I will not see you come to harm in my realm. As Kingston has said, I too, owe you an explanation and an apology. Brave heroes, gifted and skilled in the ways of magic, denizens of the Unsleeping City. Each of you cross the boundary from one side to the other, though your allegiances may lie more with one than the other. This is a dangerous realm to those that fear change. To those that are unwelcome to the shifting and movement of dream and the ephemeral nature of the mind and it's hearts deepest desires. Come, let us walk here in the sixth borough. There is a diner around the corner that should be open. If you guys want to get food, but I also understand if you're not hungry."
Ricky: I could eat.
Pete: I'm starving.
"Misty: I just wanna ask, is this a situation where if we eat here, we can't leave?"
"Nod: No, you are thinking of your realm, Faerie."
"Misty: You know what, we just have a lot in common, I just wanted to make sure."
"Nod: I know, Faerie used to be in my dominion."
"Brennan: You see that Nod's black eyes sink a little bit blacker and swallow light. And then Nod goes,"
"Nod: But, there are no hard feelings. Faerie suffered the fate of all the things that have left my realm. The fate of becoming real. Come, let's go get some food. I'm hungry as hell and could use a bite."
"Brennan: You see that Nod looks up at you and says,"
"Nod: Also, I don't have any money 'cause I'm a kid."
"Misty: Yeah, can you eat solid food? How big of a baby are you? What kind of a baby are we talking here?"
"Nod: I've never called myself a baby, did someone call me a baby?"
"Misty: Yah, you’re a gray baby."
"Brennan: You see Alejandro says,"
"Alejandro: Everyone be cool, no more talking shut up."
"Ally: Yeah, we called you gray—"
Emily: One.
Ally: Gray one.
Nod: My title is the Gray Orphan.
Ally: Oh.
Nod: Does that help?
"Misty: Are you related to the Gray Lady? You know, in the New York Times?"
"Nod: A paper of record, all news that’s fit to print."
"Misty: Yeah, a different gray family or?"
Nod: The very first New York Times [suddenly threatening] was stolen from me.
Misty: Woo.
"Nod: But it's okay, I don't hold grudges like that."
Sofia: Yay. Mm.
"Misty: Oh, okay."
"Sofia: I've got a credit card, we can put it on my card."
Nod: Wonderful.
"Misty: Yeah, I'm good for it."
"Pete: Oh, I have a ton of money, I have so much money."
Nod: There is a pretty hefty foreign transaction fee here in the Sixth Borough.
"Sofia: Honestly, it'd be nice to spend money on something."
"Nod: Very good, come, let us walk."
"Brennan: You see that the orphan just slides through the mist as though on a conveyor belt and does not move their hands and just stares straight ahead as they, [mimes floating very quickly] through the mist."
Ally: Cool.
"Kugrash: All right, guys. Pete, I don't know exactly how we got to this where you have this gray baby but I feel like there's been a lot of secrets with all of us and we gotta start trusting each other or else."
"Sofia: I've been a pretty open book, personally."
Kugrash: Except for Sofie and Ricky.
Ricky: I gave you my one secret. That I went to high school and then became a firefighter.
"Misty: It's not a secret, that's just a secret—"
"Sofia: It would be helpful though to know, like, what was going on with everyone."
[somber piano music]
"Murph: Yes, so Pete, I understand that you have a hard time trusting people and you should because we're keeping-- things from you."
Misty: Oh yeah-- I'll tell you about me.
"Kugrash: We've been, I was a white collar criminal. I was a bad person and I took money that I was supposed to invest. I was an investor, I took money I was supposed to invest from a school, a first school I leveraged against it. Screwed a lot of people over. Gabriela Sinclaire, your crush's mom, was my partner, and I screwed her over and she turned me into a rat. She's a witch, so she could also have something to do with this."
Misty: Ooh.
Kugrash: And I know—
Ricky: How do you know I have a crush?
Brennan lets out a wheezing laugh.
Kugrash: It's—
Ricky: I didn't talk about--
"Kugrash: Oh, you, this is a secret, man."
Pete: You said like--
"Ricky: Well, I just haven't said it out in that way, with you guys."
Brennan: And that's where we're going to end this episode of the Unsleeping City. Tune in next week for the exciting conclusion revelation of Ricky Matsui's crush? What the hell?
Siobhan: What the hell?
Ally: Wow!
"Brennan: See you next week, gang."

"Brennan: The shimmering star-filled skies of the 6th borough snow rising from the streets, into the celestial heights. All of you exit the L train."
"Wally: Ah, dang, this is not Canarsie!"
"Kugrash: This is my son, Wally."
Brennan: And you see thousands of little rat men all wearing suits start running. [heavy breathing]
"Kingston: I don't like this place, I would like to leave."
Nod: Something was able to tip them off.
"Kingston: And what was that, gray baby?"
Nod: I would thank you not to call me that again.
Brennan: You feel something change in the dreaming.
"Angel: Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir! [blows landing]"
Emily: What the actual fuck?

[RECAP]
"Kugrash: Live like a rat, die like a rat."
[squealing]
"Brennan: A helix of rats swarms over her [growling] and as they crash down, she is gone. We're looking for a 16 or higher."
[mumbles]
Lou: No fucking way.
Murph: 20!
Ally: 20!
[screaming]
"Train: Hey everybody, let's take a little trip to Dreamland, slumber slumber, z z z."
[booms]
Brennan: The train rockets.
"Lou: I make eye contact with Pete, and in my mind say,"
Kingston: I owe you an explanation and an apology.
Nod: Come. Let us walk here in the Sixth Borough.
[END RECAP]
[dramatic music]
The cast is all pretending to martial arts punch the air.
"Brennan: Welcome, one and all, back to another episode of The Unsleeping City. Oh, you're spicy today."
Murph: So loud!
"Brennan: Look at this! Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Last we left our intrepid heroes off, they had miraculously fought the ghosts of New York's crooked cops, commanded by the onyx badge of Epona Cirillo, sensed hastily by rats, and summoned the train to Dream, making the L Train run on time for once. As the train to Nod pulled into the station, the heartbreak of Pete's knowledge that words had been said about possibly having to deal with Pete through means of violence had left the party shaken, trust damaged. However, arriving at Nod, apologies and amendments were offered not only by Kingston Brown, but also by Nod, the Monarch of Dreams, who also said an apology and an explanation was owed. The shimmering star-filled skies of the Sixth Borough, snow rising from the streets, into the celestial heights, all of you exit the L-Train. Purple, sparkling with gold, the unicorn skitters off into Nod."
Unicorn: See y'all later! Make sure to hit me up if you got some time to party!
Pete: How?
"Brennan: Exiting the train is the six of you, Nod, who begins to float towards a diner, and--"
"Ally: Oh yeah, in like a creepy way."
"Brennan: Creepy way, just sort of still, jet-black eyes unfocused, staring ahead."
Siobhan: This is fine.
"Brennan: Alejandro walks off the train as well, takes his hat off, and goes,"
"Alejandro: I can't believe it. Nod, Land of Dreams. This presents a ripe opportunity for some study. I can't believe I am seeing it here in the flesh and not through a crystal ball. This is really cool."
Sofia: You have a crystal ball?
Alejandro: I have like 100 crystal balls--
Sofia: Can you show me my way around one one time? I just... I got an ex- husband. I'm curious. I know it's not healthy.
Alejandro: For sure.
"Misty: Darling, I gotta tell you, look."
Sofia: Yeah?
"Misty: Between you and me, I've been married many, many times. The first time is rough but you get used to it."
Ricky: We're in an...this place is crazy.
"Sofia: You're right, you're right!"
"Brennan: You guys see that the little driver's door of the L Train opens, the driver door opens up, and Wally walks out and he goes,"
"Wally: Aw, dang, this is not Canarsie!"
Kugrash and Kingston stutter in surprise for a moment.
"Kugrash: This is my son, Wally."
"Sofia: Oh my god, go say hi!"
Pete: Yeah!
Kugrash: I'm a rat.
"Sofia: Okay, I'll go over. Excuse me, sir."
"Wally: Oh, dang, okay."
"Sofia: Hi, excuse me, sir! Hi!"
"Ricky: I'm a firefighter, I'm here if you have any questions."
"Wally: Yeah, thanks sir, thank you. I got turned around, they promoted me to conductor, but I think I took the train to the wrong dang place."
Ricky: You—
[somber music]
"Kugrash: Wally, I'm your dad!"
Wally: What?
Kugrash: Can you see me?
Wally: Rat Jesus?
Kugrash: It's—
Wally: You're my da?
"Kugrash: I'm your da, I'm your dad."
"Wally: Listen, I'm so, that explains so much, but my real dad is the man who raised me and his name was Bruce Kugrich and I understand that you might be my biological father but somewhere out there is Bruce and he's the man who raised me. God, am I part rat? Can I fit through stuff?"
"Kugrash: Wally, the way you're, you're not believing the wrong, like we're in a magic world, can you see? What do you see here, Wally?"
Sofia: Does it look like a Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper?
Wally: It does look like a Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper.
Sofia: I think he's seeing all right.
"Kugrash: Wally, I am Bruce Kugrash, I was… I was, Kugrich rather, I was turned into a rat."
Wally: Huh? [crying]
"Brennan: And he just starts crying and sits down, he says,"
"Wally: So wait, all those messages from Rat Jesus, it was my dad the whole time?"
"Kugrash: Yeah, exactly. Wally, I've been… I didn't know how to tell you 'cause I thought that it would, I guess I didn't give you enough credit, I thought this would… Screw you up more, knowing that your dad was a rat, but I think maybe I just prolonged it and—"
"Wally: Wait a minute. So, David said that you did a bad thing. That you were bad and you had to flee the country and you were on a tropical island with a bunch of stolen money."
"Kugrash: That part is not, see, David's a ball-buster. He's mostly right, I am a piece of shit, but I never got away. I was Polymorphed, you don't know what that is, I was turned into a rat permanently by a curse. By somebody who I screwed over. So your brother's right about most of the stuff. About me being, you know, a bad guy."
Brennan: He takes his hard hat off.
"Wally: Whoo, that's a lot to take in!"
"Kugrash: Yeah. That's a, but you know, Wally, I was gonna, there's this whole other magic part of New York and you know, I've been afraid to kinda show myself to you for my own selfish reasons but I think this is really good, I think, you know, I know you've been lonely, kid, and I think maybe we can, you know, make you some friends. Pigeons talk and stuff."
Wally: What?
Kugrash: Yeah!
Sofia: There's a pigeon that's got a hard crush on your father.
Kugrash: Yeah.
Wally: Oh! What's his name?
Kugrash: Perry.
Wally: That's cool.
"Kugrash: Should we hug? Is that cool, are you mad at me?"
"Brennan: You see he looks at you and says,"
Wally: I thought you were mad at me.
Murph: I absolutely start bawling.
"Kugrash: I could never, ever be mad at you, Wally, god dammit."
"Brennan: He picks you up and goes,"
Wally: You're way fluffier than most rats.
Emily: Sofia takes out a disposable camera and gets some pictures.
Zac: Ricky's just openly weeping.
"Sofia: [clicking] Oh god, this is beautiful."
"Brennan: He gives you a big hug and says,"
"Wally: I always thought, I always knew there was a big rat in the sewers and the tunnels that was looking out for me, nobody ever believed me none, and I always thought it was Rat Jesus, 'cause it was like, you know, I lost having a dad when I was young and then, sort of like, I dunno, the city or someone upstairs was looking out for me. [crying] It means a lot more to know it was you the whole time, Dad."
"Kugrash: Wally, I do not deserve you, you absolute beautiful bastard. No, truth be told, you helped me when I was first, your brother was right, I did a lot of bad things, I stole a lot of money from people, and I was punished for it. I was turned into a rat, that's why I don't look like I used to, and I was a bitter, angry person and I was just hiding in the tunnels wasting away, but you know, I would watch you and I would see the way that you know, you treated people, and you know, you helped me more than I could ever help you, Wally."
"Wally: [wiping his nose] Well shucks. That means a whole awful lot. And now that we know, we can find a way to turn you back from a rat!"
"Kugrash: Yeah, you know, I kinda don't mind it at this point, my life's been a lot better since I've been a rat."
"Sofia: Yeah, you should see him with a perm, he's actually very attractive."
"Wally: Okay, then we'll turn me into a rat!"
"Kugrash: That would be cute as hell, do you wanna be a rat, Wally?"
"Kingston: All right, you—"
"Ricky: Hey, I don’t know…"
Misty: You know...
"Kugrash: This is the gang, by the way, Wally, this is—"
Misty: Hi!
"Wally: My name's Wally Kugrich, I work for the MTA. This was supposed to go to Canarsie but we're gonna get this as a maintenance issue so we're gonna get this fixed as soon as possible."
"Kugrash: Wally, you don't have to, you don't have to do that."
Wally: Okay.
Kugrash: Just enjoy it.
Ricky: Why don't we go get some food?
"Misty: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea."
Brennan: Nod is already sort of progressed down—
"Pete: Oh, the gray baby!"
"Brennan: You see Nod turns around and says,"
Nod: Nod. I prefer Nod to gray baby. I am gray but I'm fully not a baby.
Nod begins to float away again.
Zac: Not a baby.
"Pete: What did the gray baby say, it's too far away."
"Kugrash: Wally, note that, don’t call it, that..."
"Sofia: Don't call it the-- Would you say you're Nod a baby, Nod yet a woman? Or a man, that was a Britney Spears reference. I'm so sorry!"
Ally: I'm Nod a girl!
Sofia: I’ll show myself out.
"Siobhan: I'm just making eyes at Kingston like, how did we get involved with all of these fucking idiots?"
"Kingston: This is easily, this is some of the wildest shit, We're in Nod."
"Misty: And all of these people are focused on like, whatever."
"Kingston: The rat man just met his son, and..."
"Brennan: You see that Wally, without even asking, picks you up and puts you on his shoulder."
Murph: Hell yeah.
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: As you ride around, he goes,"
Wally: [singing] My dad's a little rat wizard!
Ally: Wizard?
Murph: Just absolutely--
Sofia: Oh my god.
"Kugrash: Who does, we don't deserve you."
Ally: I'm crying too.
"Kugrash: We don't deserve you, Wally."
Ricky: Yes!
"Brennan: Ox is playfully jumping around as you walk. Everyone here, make Perception checks if you'd be so kind."
Lou: Everything was so sad--
Ally: 17.
Siobhan: I would also like to take a look around with my Mirror of Manannan.
Brennan: Manannan.
"Siobhan: Manannan, and See Invisibility."
"Emily: Did you, ooh, what'd you get?"
Zac: Advantage.
Siobhan: Is it Perception?
"Brennan: Perception, yes."
Ally: 19.
Lou: 16.
"Brennan: 19, 16."
"Lou: Do I still have magic, do I still have my powers?"
"Brennan: As you guys walk, so anyone that beat a 15 on a perception check, as you're walking, you kinda suddenly going, Wally's kinda talking subtly, also Alejandro's casting Identify on the different magical items you guys got from the bodega. So that's the kind of stuff going on and it feels really wild and fun here. Also there's a lot of noise coming from Nod. I would say that there are, at any given point, between five and twenty shooting stars crossing the sky here, and they do make a kind of [whooshing] noise and you can hear kind of bubbling and chattering from inside various buildings, although the streets are kind of open and not very populated here. Those that beat a 15 notice, as Kingston walks through this realm, everything here is mist on the ground that goes up to about your ankles. Where Kingston walks, the mist recedes from Kingston a little bit, and Kingston is walking on sidewalk that appears underneath him."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: And therefore the snow doesn't kind of hit him 'cause the snow is issuing from the mist. You got a 19, right, Pete?"
Ally: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: You look at this and it is somewhat melancholy as you look at it. The Dream World is receding from Kingston out of respect for his station and the power that he represents in the same way that you're able to tap in to wild abilities when you're in the Waking World, but as a result of that, this sense of whimsy and wonder and joy that everybody else seems to be able to partake in while they're here seems to, out of respect and deference, but abandon Kingston. Kingston doesn't appear able to see the reflections that you guys are seeing, the funhouse mirror of the glassy buildings that you pass by where you guys see all these strange potentials and images and fun illusions, Kingston's reflection remains his own here and doesn't change into something else and there is a stoic silence that reflects a deep sadness as Kingston walks through this place."
Ally: Whoa.
Emily: I'm glad I rolled low on that Perception check.
Siobhan: It's so sad.
Emily: It's kind of a burden.
"Siobhan: Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: I think it was made even sadder by the fact that nobody else notices, and everyone's just like wow."
"Misty: Wow! Hey gray baby, can I fly?"
Nod: Do you wish to fly?
Brennan: You begin to [whooshing] float up into the air.
Zac: I grab her ankle.
Emily: I grab his ankles!
"Brennan: You see that Misty, your umbrella pops open and you—"
"Ricky: I got you, I got you!"
"Brennan: You see that Ox jumps up and grabs onto your purse, Sofia."
"Sofia: Good dog, good dog."
"Brennan: And [whooshing] you guys whisk away, off into the night sky. You see that the woman in the moon turns around and goes,"
"Woman in the Moon: Oh, lovely, it's been so long."
"Misty: It's been so long, you look great."
Woman in the Moon: You look great.
Misty: You look great!
"Brennan: You see she [magical noises] swirls a wind of moon dust around you, all of your clothing sparkles, and you see that all the denizens of this place start going,"
"Denizens: Hey, it's Misty Moore! [clapping]"
"Misty waves down at them, smiling."
Brennan: And they start clapping.
Zac: [holding his arms up] Just like kind of shaking.
Brennan: As you--
Siobhan: No days off.
"Brennan: As you fly away, you see that there is this incredible marble statue at a flying grand piano that begins to twirl around you in the air and says,"
"Statue: Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable, the one and only, Misty Moore."
Misty: [singing] Fly me to the moon. Let me sing among the stars.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a Performance check with advantage.
Sofia: A free Misty Moore show?
Siobhan: That is a 26.
"Brennan: Incredible! Misty, your illusion magic doesn't even cost spell slots here. You watch the most heart-rending performance of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" as this statue plays the piano in accompaniment, you actually fly up to the moon and as you sort of hit the last, final note, the moon actually leans and kisses you on the cheek. You are effectively Blessed."
Siobhan: Obviously.
"Brennan: You see she says,"
Woman in the Moon: I loved you my whole life.
"Misty: Oh no, I loved you my whole life."
Brennan: You see she looks at you—
Siobhan: I make out with the moon.

"Brennan: You see the moon, you guys see Misty and this giant moon start really kinda going at it."
Ricky: What's happening up there?
Ally: You're holding onto her leg.
Emily: I'm holding on.
"Murph: Her mouth goes open, her [mumbling]"
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, full 1940s Hollywood, there's like a lot of laws about how much you can kiss, so it's like full closed mouth, but moving back and forth."
Emily: I like to think there's one little cruel intention spit that falls on us.
"Siobhan: Ah, so nasty."
"Brennan: Misty, you feel incredible here. You also have a lot more control here over how you appear. Your illusion magic, you think you can kinda cast it here, kind of without too much trouble at all."
"Siobhan: Okay, great"
Brennan: So it feels very elementally similar to Faerie here which you haven't been back to—
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: In centuries. The only difference between this place and Faerie that you can kind of feel intrinsically is weirdly, Faerie is a little bit more conservative than this place is."
Siobhan: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: Faerie has kings and queens and hierarchy and laws about eating food in places and doing favors for people.
"Misty: Ugh, why else would I leave? No kings, no masters, that's what you get in New York City."
"Brennan: Exactly, so you're having a ball here. You eventually descend back down. You guys follow Nod towards the banks of the East River and you see that Nod just starts walking into the East River just submerging in the water and starts to kind of glide effortlessly underneath the water of the East River."
Emily: I'm gonna follow.
Brennan: You guys follow—
"Emily: I take out a little nip,"
Sofia: [knocks back a drink] Let's do this.
"Brennan: You guys go down, the water exists purely kind of on the surface, and as you go through, the sound is the quality of being underwater but you're not wet, it just feels very chilly and brisk down here."
Siobhan: How's Kingston doing?
"Lou: Yeah, is this—"
Siobhan: Is he just sopping wet and unable to—
"Lou: Did I, I see all of these things, like I watch her kiss—"
"Brennan: Make out with the moon, yes."
"Lou: It's just for me, there's no flying or those sorts of—"
"Brennan: You are unable to fly here and as you approach the water, the water parts as you got here."
Ally: Can I run up to Kingston and hand him a little Tupperware salad that I had in my pocket?
Brennan: You hand Kingston a Tupperware salad.
"Pete: Hey, man, I got this to go at a restaurant I was at earlier. I don't know if you're getting hungry."
Kingston: Oh.
Misty: Are there drugs in the salad?
Pete: No.
Misty: Did you put drugs in the salad?
"Ally: It's sober, it's actually a sober salad."
Kugrash: It's just a salad.
"Misty: I mean, the fact that you have a word for a sober salad as opposed to—"
"Kingston: I mean, its funny that you have to discern..."
Pete: This one is a sober salad.
Ricky: What's not a sober salad?
Pete: You just put ketamine over the tomatoes. It's fun.
Emily: That sounds good for a—
Kingston: Absolutely wild.
Pete: But this one isn't like that!
"Kingston: Thank you, Pete."
Pete: Yeah.
Kingston: [mumbling] Maybe I'll eat it later.
"Pete: Yeah, cool."
"Brennan: You hold this sweet thing, as you hold the salad from Pete, you feel, Kingston, a little bit of the joy of the Dream Realms seep in through your fingers, through this little Tupperware of salad, and you see that a bunch of the little cherry tomatoes in the salad turn around and eyes pop out and they go,"
Tomatoes: [squeaky] We're good for ya!
Kingston: Fuck this! [throws the Tupperware] I thought you said it was a sober salad!
Pete: It is a sober salad!
Kingston: Why are the cherry tomatoes talking to me?
"Pete: We're in the Dream World, man."
Kingston: Okay.
"Kugrash: Wally, look at the tomatoes!"
Murph: I hold it up to him.
"Wally: Oh, look at that, what ya guys' names?"
"Brennan: And you see they say,"
Esteban: We're all named Esteban.
Zac: I take some of the cherry tomatoes and eat them.
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
Esteban: We all have the same name! We're gonna make him strong and healthy!
[chewing]
"Ricky: Thank you, tomatoes, for your nourishment."
Pete: Are you religious?
"Kugrash: I feel like you and Wally should hang out, Ricky."
"Brennan: You see Wally says,"
"Wally: Aye! Oh man, look at you!"
"Brennan: He says,"
"Wally: I think I seen you before, I got the Fireman's Calendar 'cause I love heroism."
"Ricky: Oh yeah, definitely, I'm Mr. March in that."
"Wally: Hi, I'm Wally Kugrich, I work for the MTA."
"Ricky: Nice to meet you, Wally. We could be really good friends, if you'd like."
Wally: Okay!
"Ricky: Okay, great."
"Wally: Okay, you're my best friend!"
"Ricky: Awesome, you're my best friend."
Wally: Awesome!
Brennan: He puts an arm around your shoulder.
Zac: I think that Kugrich is on.
Murph: Just crying on both of you.
"Emily: Oh my god, this is—"
Siobhan: Just such disgusting grubby tears.
[Kugrash coughing]
"Brennan: [mimes walking with two fingers] You guys begin to walk along the floor of the East River. As you walk along the floor of the East River, you see there's a bunch of sort of toilets filled with treasure down here, and bathtubs overflowing with silver coins. You see that on little anchor chains covered in algae and sort of seaweed, there are these giant king beds that are just floating partially in the water and you see that each bed has a little mobster in a pinstripe suit [mimes a stereotypical child’s peaceful sleep pose] with a bunch of fishes—"
"Siobhan: Aww, he's sleeping with the fishes!"
[Brennan snores]
Emily: Are they pixies?
Brennan: Human mobsters.
Ally: Oh my god.
[Brennan snoring]
"Sofia: I mean, that's so peaceful, do these kind of bad guys deserve such a nice end?"
Pete: Yeah.
"Misty: Look, as again, they may be mobsters but they're great supporters of the arts."
"Emily: So, can I try to wake one up?"
[snores]
Mobster: Oh. [mumbling] I'm trying to sleep here. You’re wakin' up all my fishes.
Brennan: You see the fishes just start swimming around.
Sofia: What’d you do to sleep with the fishes?
Mobster: Hm?
Sofia: What’d you do to sleep with the fishes?
"Mobster: I crossed the Don, I ratted him out to the feds."
Sofia: Oh.
Ricky: Which Don? Don Confetti?
"Mobster: Oh, no, Lucky Luciano."
Ricky: Oh.
Sofia: Okay.
Ricky: Had to try.
Sofia: All right.
"Kugrash: Well, good work."
"Pete: Well Ricky, you're gonna get a clue soon, I'm serious, man."
Ricky: I feel like it's coming. I feel like eventually I'm gonna figure a thing out.
"Misty: Yeah, you can text Esther about it."
Ricky: Do I have service?
Brennan: Only people that have Sprint have service here.
"Sofia: Oh, amazing!"
[gentle jazz]
"Brennan: You guys continue on. You see this enormous diner at the bottom of the East River called Poseidon's Diner and you see there's a huge statue of Poseidon holding a trident up on the top of it but inside it's like chrome milkshake machine form like a countertop. You see that there's a bunch of merfolk waitresses but they are like, you see that there's a very big, broad mermaid woman, older, in her fifties, she's looking at a cigarette, and those horn-rimmed glasses with a chain around them, seashell bra, but then a little waitress apron around her fish tail, swimming around, and there's a little name tag on the seashell bra that says ""Helen"" on it."
"Helen: [chain-smoker voice] Hey, you guys trying to sit down and eat?"
Pete: Yeah.
Sofia: Yeah.
Pete: We'd love to!
Kugrash: Get a big table.
"Misty: I do have a little quick question about, I don't want to be rude, but, as a faerie, you know where I'm coming from. If we eat here, we can still leave, right?"
"Helen: Oh yeah, there's no rules about that here."
Misty: Okay.
Pete: You're not worried about that.
Misty: I just needed to know.
Sofia: That’s good that she's looking out for us.
"Misty: Look, there are a lot of strange rules in these other dimensions and it's better to--"
Ricky: Do you have turkey burgers?
"Misty: When you go to another place, it's good to know about the culture."
Helen: We have turkey burgers.
Sofia: Do you have a low-cal menu?
"Helen: Oh, for sure, sweetheart."
Sofia: Okay.
"Helen: Yeah, we got the whole,"
"Brennan: And she hands a little thing,"
"Helen: It's at the very bottom, after the beverages on the last page."
"Sofia: Oh, this is great, it's not just cottage cheese everything."
"Helen: Oh, cool, I understand."
"Brennan: You see that the menu is the thickest menu in the world, gleaning diner mints in a silver bowl up at the front counter, and a bunch of these mermaids sort of swim around, you see there's gonna be a lot of different Greek myths here, you see some dryads over in a corner, there appears to be some tritons and various, there's a parking lot outside that has a bunch of hippocampi, like giant seahorses and stuff like that."
Zac: Can I look at the mints?
"Brennan: Yeah you do, you see some little mints there."
"Zac: Okay, and I'm just gonna take one."
Ally: Question them about Don Confetti.
"Brennan: Cool, you take a mint, you see that the mint looks up at you and goes,"
"Mint: [British accent, very dramatic] Know this. I am intended to be eaten after the meal to freshen your breath. Should you hold onto me for too long, I will get chalky and crumbly in your pocket and you may wash your clothes with me and there will be a sticky patch on them for eons to come."
Ricky: [very seriously] It's a risk I'm willing to take.
Sofia: Ask the mint if it's true that's lots of pee on them. I saw a 20/20 and they said there's lots of pee on mints.
[dramatic music]
Ricky: Just a quick question. What's your name?
Ronaldo: My name is Ronaldo Manticaster.
"Ricky: Ronaldo Manticaster, do you, are you covered in pee by any chance?"
Ronaldo: Only my own.
"Ricky: [nods, puts it in his pocket] Thank you."
Murph: Kugrash eats a mint.
"Brennan: You guys see at this giant corner booth, Alejandro finishes identifying the objects and he says,"
Alejandro: These are truly some remarkable treasures from the bodega of La Gran Gata that you have discovered.
"During Alejandro’s talk, Brennan hands out item cards to Lou, Zac, and Murph."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Alejandro: This here is the Grill of Persuasion. By putting it in your mouth, you have honeyed words that can affect the hearts of those that you speak to."
Pete: Sick.
"Alejandro: This is the Holy Grail Detergent. It can restore not only the clothes, but the very soul of the wearer. This is a really jacked-up thousand hour energy, it can, I mean, this will put some pep in your step for a long time. And this is the Bagel of All Things."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Alejandro: The bagel's toppings contain everything in creation, in microcosm, simply shake some of the toppings onto a paper plate and you can read the fortune of the world in the toppings themselves."
Siobhan: Sick.
Murph: Hell yeah.
"Lou: Oh, cool."
Emily: Oh my god.
Pete: I'm glad you didn't eat it.
"Kugrash: Yeah, I definitely almost ate it."
"Sofia: I am so sorry, I really encouraged you to eat it."
"Misty: I mean, your shits would've told some real stories there."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Alejandro: if you consume the Bagel of All Things, you will disperse your essence throughout the universe."
Sofia: [gasps] What a way to go!
Ricky: Is that good?
"Alejandro: It's supposed to be, it will destroy your ego and your identity, but bring your consciousness into alignment with all of the cosmos. Also, it's very good toasted. I hear you should get it toasted."
"Murph: Maybe I'll get it toasted and then maybe if I'm like about to die, I'll pop it."
"Sofia: Okay, yeah."
Kingston: You'll pop it?
"Misty: Yeah, that makes sense."
"Kugrash: I might pop it, I might pop a bagel."
Pete: I’ll pop it.
Zac: It lasts for for forty-two days?
"Kugrash: I can unhinge my jaw, did you see how many mints I just ate?"
Zac: Should I just drink this now?
"Sofia: Yeah, his thousand hour energy will last for forty-two days."
Zac: Lasts for 42 days.
Siobhan: Geez Louise.
"Murph: Wait, so you just don't sleep?"
"Zac: Once consumed, the imbiber is immune to sleep effects and exhaustion, could I just not sleep for 42 days?"
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Sofia: [gasps] Oh my god, I'm not telling you what to do, Mr. March--"
"Pete: Dude, eat first, don't drink that on an empty stomach."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Pete: Let's grab some food, do you have huevos rancheros here? Can I talk to—"
"Helen: Oh yeah, for sure, we got huevos rancheros."
"Misty: Oh, I would actually love some cottage cheese with some fruit on top."
Helen: Cottage cheese.
Kingston: Can I get an egg cream?
"Helen: Yeah, we gotcha egg cream for sure."
Pete: The fuck is an egg cream?
Helen: You haven't had an egg cream?
"Misty: Oh my god, an egg cream is a classic."
"Kingston: All right, can we get two egg creams?"
"Sofia: Actually, I'll get one too, I love an egg cream."
"Misty: You know, I'll do an egg cream. I want a chocolate egg cream!"
Sofia: Everybody get an egg cream.
Ricky: Egg cream please?
"Brennan: And you see Nod says,"
"Nod: Helen. By the order of Nod, egg creams for the entire table."
[whooshing]
"Brennan: And you see that Helen brings out your various orders. They come out right away, it's diner food, it's the best. The lighting in here's perfect, you guys can talk as loud as you want and you just have this feeling of wholeness and oneness here."
Ally: I'm slicing into my egg cream. [mimes cutting something]
"Sofia: Oh my god, it's—"
Kingston: You need to get your egg in that fork and knife out of the glass.
Sofia: It's a drink.
"Brennan: You get an egg cream, which is an old Depression-era New York delicacy. It's seltzer, chocolate syrup, it's sort of a—"
Ally: And eggs?
Brennan: No eggs in it.
Emily: But there's milk in it.
Brennan: I think it's basically a—
Siobhan: It's sparkling milk. Sparkling chocolate milk.
"Brennan: Sparkling chocolate milk, it's a low-rent milkshake from the era of the Great Depression."
"Pete: [sips, makes a face] No."
"Kingston: That's fine, it's not for everybody."
"Pete: But thank you, but thank you, but thank you."
Kingston: Egg creams aren't for everybody.
"Pete: There's a Turkish carbonated yogurt drink that I tried a little while ago, and I felt the same way about that."
"Kingston: Oh, I might like that."
"Pete: Yeah, maybe."
Misty: Fermented things are very good for you.
"Brennan: You see that Nod is sitting next to Pete and Nod is just leaning their head against Pete's arm and kind of, Nod looks very much like a little kid whose beloved older brother has just come back from college and is just holistically and warmly just obsessed with Pete, leaning their head against Pete's arm. And you see that Nod looks up and can sort of hear your bottles of stuff rattling around in your coat and just opens up their hand and makes a bunch of insane purple gold-flecked pills show up in their hand."
[magical sounds]
Pete: What? What is that?
"Nod: If you want it, I don't know. It just seems like you like that kind of stuff so I thought I'd make some for you."
"Pete: Oh, that's, well that's a perfect segue, you guys, I'm gonna try to rein in the drugs."
"Misty: Oh, great."
"Pete: You know, it's, I get it, there's a lot of things I'm learning right now so, it's gonna be hard enough sober so why, you know, why add mushrooms?"
Ricky: You want a drug? Go for a run.
"Pete: Anyway, Nod, thanks again. I'm gonna just pretend that I didn't scroll past that in my feed. That's really nice of you, I'll just keep these, you know, but thanks."
Brennan: Nod smiles.
"Nod: As I've stated before, welcome, all of you, to the Dream Realm. Nod. I'm so happy that you're here. Pete, you saved my life. Thank you so much."
Pete: Yeah.
"Nod: As I was saying before, I owe you an apology and an explanation. Dark forces are moving against the will of New York City, both the Waking World and the Dreaming. Every so often, in a time of great peril and change, it has fallen to me, the Gray Orphan of New York, to select a champion to fight for and advocate and wield the power of the Dream Realm. Because of the dismissal that most humans give to their dreams, forgetting them upon waking, and the cynicism and realism that pervades most people's waking minds, the Dreaming cannot send a message to this champion beforehand because these messages would be dismissed and batted away. Even you, Pete, for so long, believed that your role as the Vox Phantasma was simply an illusion or a hallucination."
"Pete: Yeah, I thought I was going crazy."
Nod: And I'm so sorry for that.
"Pete: No, that's fine, I mean [to Sofia] you just entered this too, right? This is nuts."
"Sofia: I mean, I thought I was drunk for a while, which I was, I shouldn't say I wasn't drunk."
"Pete: I thought I was high for a while, which I was."
"Sofia: Which you also were, yeah, I could tell."
"Misty: Yeah, maybe you should start a sobriety club."
Sofia: I'm gonna do a dry January but I'd like to enjoy the holidays.
Misty: That's all right.
"Brennan: Nod looks over and says,"
"Nod: So, unfairly and unfortunately, the only way for me to make contact with the Vox Phantasma is to choose one, which means that you didn't get a say in receiving these powers and for that I'm sorry."
"Pete: Yeah, that's okay, it's been cool so far."
"Nod: I'm glad. I think I chose right. You saved my life and I think, for whatever it's worth, Pete, you're a pretty good hero."
"Pete: [strained] Oh, god, this means a lot to me. Thank you, thanks."
"Brennan: You see that Nod looks out and says,"
"Nod: There's some other business to discuss though, which is that Robert is moving against New York City."
Sofia: Yeah.
Ricky: What is Robert's deal?
Sofia: Why does he wanna control the flow of magic?
Kugrash: He also—
"Sofia: Why does he, it seems like he's trying to create spaces that cannot be accessed by magic and scried upon and are confusing magic in other boroughs."
Nod: Robert Moses constructed what the Gramercy Occult Society understands as the Highway Hex.
"Brennan: You see Alejandro's eyes go wide as this is said. You see he goes,"
Alejandro: This...I can't believe that that's true. You see that—
Sofia: Does he have anything to do with the Faerie?
"Brennan: You see that Nod sort of acknowledges that and says,"
Nod: Mr. Moses wanted wealth and power above all else and therefore sold his soul to Hell and to Faerie.
Sofia: Oh!
Misty: That double-dealing motherfucker.
Sofia: I actually meant a different faerie but go on.
"Brennan: You see Nod looks up and they say,"
"Nod: If nothing else, Robert Moses is one of the most proficient deal-makers and power-brokers of all time. By selling his soul to Hell and to Faerie, he was able to capitalize on both sources of power through magic for most of his living career and when the time came for him to die, neither party could collect without risking angering the other faction."
"Sofia: So it was just double-dealing, he pretended like, how do you sell your soul twice? Isn't there some sort of proof that you would still have it?"
"Misty: I mean, look. I gotta say, Faerie is not great at paperwork. [sucks in a breath]"
Sofia: Okay.
"Brennan: You see Nod points to Misty and says,"
"Nod: He made the deal with Faerie first, knowing that their bureaucratic record-keeping wouldn't reach Hell in time."
"Misty: Which is like, it's no fun. We're like a real fun-focused people. We don't love paperwork, it's like oh, we trust you."
Sofia: I understand.
"Misty: Bad idea, always bad."
"[tense, low music]"
"Brennan: You see that Nod says,"
"Nod: Robert, I do not know Robert Moses' plans, I do not know what he is doing or why he is moving against us, but I do know that his mind is fixed on that thing which Pete summoned forth at the beginning of his powers, which is what I was referencing when I mentioned the words of Lazarus."
"Brennan: Misty, would you be kind enough to share with us the New Colossus? Emma Lazarus was a very powerful caster."
Siobhan gets out her phone and begins to search up the poem.
"Misty: Yeah, this is definitely a thing that I know off by heart. Just give me a second to remember what it is."
"Pete: Why did I have to look in a mirror to get you, why did Robert Moses have me look into a mirror?"
"Brennan: You see that Nod looks at you and says,"
"Nod: The Dream World is a reflection of the Waking World and there's a powerful connection between dreaming and mirrors and reflections of all kinds, if you remember falling through that puddle the first time you came here. They're an easy way to access these other realms."
Pete: Whoa.
"Nod: Dreaming and the Waking World have some… They can exist in harmony, but more often than not they exist in conflict and a lot of that has to do with the values that are espoused by each."
Pete: Hmm.
"Brennan: You see Nod looks at you and says,"
"Nod: The nature of this realm is a chimeric one. And by that, I mean it is the ephemeral axiom. In Dream..."
"Brennan: And you see that Nod summons a little twirling thing of smoke and light and says,"
"Nod: Take for example, a child's wish."
"Brennan: And you see [whooshing] this child's wish kind of manifests in the smoke and you see it is a trip to Disneyland and a new bicycle and having a superpower to stop a bully at school, and this other thing, shifting and shifting and shifting and shifting and shifting and shifting and shifting and then Nod looks at you and says,"
"Nod: But, well, you already know, Pete, that when you cast your magic in the Waking World, a thing that can be multiple things, when it comes into contact with the Waking World,"
[whooshing]
"Brennan: You see there's just a bike, stationary."
Nod: Has to be just one thing.
"Pete: Mm, mm-hmm."
"Nod: That's the power of the Waking World. When you take a dream from the Dreaming and you bring it to life, all the things it could've been die and only the thing that it is survives."
"Brennan: As soon as Nod says that, Sofia, you in your head hear,"
Voice 1: It is what it is.
"Brennan: You see that Nod looks sort of blankly ahead, Wally kind of goes,"
"Wally: Wow, I get that!"
Misty: I do have a little bit of signal down here even though I don't have Sprint.
Sofia: You can borrow mine if you want.
"Misty: No no, no, it's fine, oh what is that, a Galaxy Note 5?"
"Lou: That's huge, that's a massive phone."
"Sofia: Yeah, I like it, I can see a little better, I can read it like a magazine."
Misty clears her throat and begins to read Emma Lazarus’ “The New Colossus” off of her phone.
"Misty: Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,"
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
"Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand"
"A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame"
"Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name"
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
"""Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!"" cries she"
"With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,"
"Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,"
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
"Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,"
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!
"Brennan: At the words ""golden door,"" Pete, you feel above the sky here in Dreaming, in New York City, [Brennan draws the shape of a rectangle in the air with the sounds of lasers accompanying it] the golden rectangle that first appeared to you when the voice started speaking."
Voice 2: Start spreading the news.
Brennan: Nod looks up.
Nod: The Golden Door.
Pete: What?
Misty: Did I do that?
Pete: What was that? There was a golden rectangle and I think Lazarus was talking about...
"Nod: Lazarus was a powerful Vox Phantasma. In her time, in the mid-1800s, she was the voice of Dream and the dream behind the golden door was what those tempest-tossed were seeking."
Brennan: You see that—
Pete: Citizenship.
"Brennan: You see that they kind of actually nod and say,"
"Nod: But the Mother of Exiles lifts her lamp beside the golden door. Prosperity, opportunity..."
"Brennan: And you see that the black eyes shimmer,"
Nod: The American Dream. It's a very powerful dream indeed.
"Brennan: You see that Nod looks and says,"
"Nod: When you call a little wish or a figment into the Waking World, it can become a spell. A moment, a flash, a joke, a little bit of joy. There are dreams that are so large and important that they represent a threat to the cosmos if they are brought into the Waking World. They're called paragons. Dreams of such magnitude and importance that causing them to manifest in waking life would break or rupture them. Just in the way that that wish becoming a bicycle destroys all the other versions, bringing something from Dream to Waking, if that thing is a paragon, destroys so much."
Pete: Hm.
Nod: There have only been three paragons before this one. The Golden Door is what we call a paragon doorway. It is something that is created when a dream is so powerful that its meaning keeps moving back and forth from Dream to Waking. The Golden Door exists because of all the people that came here looking for it and all of their belief in it and questing after it means that it starts to become realer and realer. These doorways happen and they represent a success of a dream becoming so important but also great danger in its ability to be pulled into the Waking World.
Misty: What are the other two?
Ricky: Was one of them the Grand Canyon?
"Brennan: [laughs] You see that Nod shakes their head, looks up and says,"
"Nod: There were three before and they were all a long time before, not even anywhere near this part of Nod, The three paragon doorways that existed before were the Pearly Gates, the Mouth of Hell, and the Road to Faerie."
Pete: Mm.
"Kingston: So, let me get this straight. What I hear from you is that the American Dream is one of these paragons and you think that in some way, Robert Moses is trying to bring the American Dream into the Waking World?"
Nod shrugs.
Misty: And so that there's a static meaning for the American Dream? That’s not ephemeral?
Sofia: So as to destroy it.
"Ricky: I think he wants to create a fourth space, right?"
Kingston: Like a fourth—
"Sofia: Oh, like there is.."
"Ricky: Like Heaven, Hell, Faerie, American Dream."
Siobhan: Can I do a History check on this?
Brennan: You can make a History check.
"Emily: Waking world, dream..."
Siobhan: How is my History? [mumbles] How 'bout a 9?
"Brennan: You've got no, so the guesses so far were creating a fourth space, and then also this idea of like bringing it out would create that fourth, or yeah, dragging it into the Waking World would give it a static meaning. You see that Nod looks at you and says,"
Nod: Taking the paragon doorway that has existed in New York City for centuries and bringing it into the Waking World—
Sofia: Would close it?
Nod: Dreams shouldn't have just one meaning. Not dreams that big and not dreams that important.
Misty: I agree.
"Ally: So then who was saying ""spread the news, I'm leaving today?"""
"[spooky, atonal music]"
"Brennan: Nod shrinks a little bit at that and says,"
Nod: Whatever was on the other side of the door.
"Misty: Oh god, it's not the Protestant work ethic, is it? 'Cause that is exhausting and I've had enough of it."
"Kugrash: So this guy Robert Moses also does a lot of business in the Waking World, 'cause I knew him in the 80s."
Sofia: Yeah.
Kugrash: So—
Pete: So this could be business-driven.
"Kugrash: So what does all of this have to, why would he wanna hurt you? Why did he wanna kill you?"
"Nod: Because I've barred his entrance into Nod. I think he saw it as an opportunity to capture me and finally get access to the door, I haven't allowed him entrance here."
"Ricky: He deals with real estate, right? Is it like a certain amount, does he wanna be the first person to get all this land?"
"Brennan: You see Nod kinda shrugs and says,"
"Nod: I don't know what Robert does or doesn't understand about this place. Robert is, or was, undead. Undreaming. Can't come here other than physically."
"Misty: You know, I am old enough to remember when motherfuckers like that used to live in goddamn Westchester."
[Brennan laughs]
Kugrash: Does he want it?
Misty: Why they think they can come into my New York City...
Ricky: Hey Wally?
Wally: Yeah?
"Ricky: What were you, where were you on the train?"
Wally: I was in the conductor's little room. The little conductor's place where you drive the train?
"Ricky: And there wasn't, you were by yourself?"
Sofia: I think it was Alejandro's music.
"Brennan: He goes,"
Wally: Yeah! I was there by myself!
Murph: I cast Dispel Magic on Wally.
[Emily gasps]
[magical sounds]
"Brennan: You see Wally goes,"
Wally: [screams] Wow!
"Kugrash: Just making sure, bud."
Wally: Okay.
"Kingston: Hold on Nod, I got one more bone to pick with you. With regard to the Dreamfolk who we had to deal with in Brooklyn, I mean what was that about?"
Pete: The Bugsters.
"Brennan: You see Nod says, Nod looks a little bit troubled at that, and kind of almost glares at you a little bit, Kingston. Nod says,"
[dramatic music]
"Nod: They escaped because Pete gave them permission to leave, Pete wields the power of this realm. Some… Something was able to tip them off."
"Kingston: And what was that, gray baby?"
"Nod: I don't know. I don't know. In order to create a Vox Phantasma, I have to give a piece of myself and it means that I'm not as powerful here as I would otherwise be."
Pete: Who did you give a piece of yourself to?
Nod points at him.
Ally: I start crying.
Pete: [through a sob] Which piece?
"Kingston: So you're telling me that there's something going on here in Dreamland that is leading to people wanting to come to, the folk of Dreamland to come to New York and you don't know about it?"
"Nod: The Vermians that went to Astoria, they're around here, they're kind of a pest or a parasite, mostly the rest of the Dream World can keep them at bay but something managed to make its way here and tip them off, not Robert who can't come here."
Sofia: What do you mean by tip them off though?
Nod: Let them know where Pete was going to be and trick him or take advantage of Pete not understanding his powers to get into New York.
"Sofia: I think what Kingston is saying though is, what is creating the desire to leave the Dream World for the Waking World or is that just—"
"Misty: It's great here, why would you ever wanna leave?"
"Sofia: Yeah, why would anyone wanna leave?"
"Brennan: You see that Nod says,"
"Nod: Every night, millions of people come here. So why wouldn't the people here wanna go to the Waking World sometimes?"
"Misty: Oh, you're right. Hey look. If you want tickets to the premiere of ""Midsummer Nights,"" here, let me just—"
Nod: Wow! They have popcorn?
Misty: They don't have popcorn but you can get a little bag of mixed nuts.
Nod: Okay!
"Misty: And a tiny little sippy cup of wine, like you're a tiny child but you're drinking wine. It's great, I love it."
"Sofia: I love those, you just rip the top off."
"Misty: No, you just sip it from the sippy cup."
"Brennan: Nod goes,"
Nod: I like the sippy cup part.
"Brennan: You see that Nod says,"
"Nod: But, what's important to remember also is that..."
[suspenseful music]
"Nod: Within the aspect of all the things happening here in Nod, Pete saved me and Robert is not allowed to come here. There is a degree to which the Golden Door has already started to slip into New York. Since Emma Lazarus wrote that poem, it's been partially there in the Waking World, but mostly it's still here in Nod and I have taken precautions. Robert Moses can't come here. Also, the door is locked and can't be opened."
Pete: Key to the city.
"Sofia: The key to the city, someone has it, someone stole it from the bodega."
Misty: He has the key to the city.
"Kingston: If he has the key to the city, could he open the door, gray baby?"
Nod: [whispering threateningly] I would thank you not to call me that again.
"Misty: He means it in a respectful way, like hey, baby, that happens to be gray like a term of affection, not that you are a child."
"Brennan: You see that Nod, Nod sort of acknowledges that and goes,"
"Nod closes their eyes, and something magical whooshes."
"Brennan: And you [Pete] feel something change in the Dreaming. Nod goes,"
Nod: Okay. I'm glad to know. There is no longer a lock on the Golden Door.
Sofia: Like a punch code? You can trust us.
"Brennan: You see Nod shakes their head and says,"
Nod: So the door is both locked right now but also does not have a lock any longer.
Sofia: Okay.
Misty: Does that mean that the American Dream is unavailable for the people coming to New York now? It’s done?
Sofia: [crosstalk] I do have—
"Brennan: You see that Nod looks at you and says,"
"Nod: Maybe you can all go back to the Waking World and then I can open the door again, or at least let it be unlocked so that those coming here can go through. But for maybe a day or two."
Brennan: You see that Nod kinda looks sheepish.
"Nod: Maybe for a day or two, it'd be better just to keep it shut all the way."
"Sofia: So as the door slips from Dream World into the Waking World, does that mean that the many paths to success become less and less and fewer and fewer and fewer?"
Brennan: You see Nod sort of agrees.
Sofia: If there's like a gradient?
"Brennan: They say,"
"Nod: The paragon doorway is the vessel through which the paragon comes so the Golden Door becoming more and more real makes the risk higher and higher that something could draw the full paragon on the other side through into the Waking World and the closer that is to happening, the closer we are to it being one thing forever."
"Sofia: Destroying many paths, yeah."
"Misty: He can't come here, but can he go to Faerie? 'Cause Faerie, I know, is adjacent."
"Nod: Robert Moses won't leave New York City. He owes his soul to both Faerie and Hell and they sent people to collect on his debt and by the time they got there, he had finished building the highways and they could no longer scry through or enter. I'm sure you're well aware, Misty, that no one's been able to come seeking justice for things owed to them for a while."
"When she’s addressed, Misty’s eyes widen, then she looks down and clears her throat."
"Misty: [stutters] Yeah, no—"
Kugrash: What does that mean?
Pete: Why would you know?
"Misty: Oh, well,"
Zac: Can I make a Perception check?
"Misty: I may not have left Faerie on the best of terms but look, everybody comes to New York City for a reason. I felt like Faerie wasn't, you know, I wasn't growing in Faerie. There's a very strong hierarchy there and you're just like, whoa, God, how many more hundreds of years do I have to pay my dues? You know what I mean?"
Sofia: So they're just coming to claim your presence?
Misty: Well that and I may have taken a little tiny baby little souvenir with me.
Pete: A baby souvenir?
Sofia: Was it a baby?
Ricky: Like a rattle?
Misty: It was not—
Sofia: Like a gray baby?
"Misty: Well look, you may, faeries are pretty allergic to iron and iron is pretty prevalent in the Waking World and especially—"
"Sofia: Don't worry, [showing off her jewelry] all this is real gold."
"Misty: Thank you, I appreciate it, but you may have noticed--"
Ally: Can I do an Investigate to see if that's actually gold?
"Sofia: It's all real gold, I get it from—"
"Ally: Ooh, I got a 5."
"Brennan: Dude, that's real gold."
"Ally: Okay, cool."
"Sofia: Ebay, they have to verify."
"Misty: Oh yes, no, it's beautiful. They're beautiful rings. Yeah no, my shoes may have, technically still belong to [clears throat] Titania but she wasn't using them, she never leaves Faerie, like what a waste of a beautiful thing, do you know what I mean?"
Kingston: Titania from the show?
"Misty: Oh, Titania, oh, well, [stutters a little] Titania from the show, but also Titania from Faerie."
"Sofia: Wow, so you embodying her on stage is kinda like a fuck you to someone you already stole from?"
"Misty: No, I would say it was a tribute or an homage."
Sofia: Just digesting. [laughs]
"Kingston: An homage, okay."
Kugrash: She's gonna kill you.
"Misty: Only if she can get here, and I have her goddamn shoes."
"Kingston: [laughs] God damn, Misty."
"Sofia: Wow, Misty, I mean, I didn't think I could love you any more."
Kingston: Jesus.
Brennan: You see that Nod smiles and seems so happy with all of you being here. Alejandro's just in a daze looking around. The diner food is delicious—
Emily: I put a little Kahlua in my egg cream.
Misty: That sounds real—
Pete: That's disgusting!
"Misty: That does sound great, I will have some Kahlua."
"Sofia: Yeah, I know. Thank you. It’s really good."
"Kugrash: Do we wanna use the bagel to, do we have a theory about--"
Kingston: What's the bagel do?
"Kugrash: The bagel lets me do a Divination, kinda like ask—"
Kingston: Okay.
Kugrash: A god of the world.
Sofia: Oh.
"Pete: Yeah, let's figure out what's really going on with Bob Moses."
"Sofia: My feeling is that there's still, maybe I'm harping on an old thing that no else is still thinking about—"
Pete: The laundering souls.
"Sofia: The laundering of the souls and trying to, I almost wonder what's going on there, is he trying to like, I don't know."
"Kugrash: I guess the question is, is he trying to get into these type of places or is just trying to like—"
Sofia: Keep people out.
Kugrash: Keep people out.
Ricky: I think he's trying to make his own—
Kugrash: He's trying to be the king of New York.
Sofia: Oh yeah.
"Kingston: I think he needs to be somewhere, he can't be, like, I dunno, in Hell and Faerie, he can't leave New York, yeah, I think he needs his own—"
"Kugrash: What about the Pearly Gates, though, that's a different thing. Is he trying to get to heaven?"
"Sofia: That's exactly what it is, if he sold his soul to two people, he's trying to make it harder for other people to get into New York."
"Kingston: It's his soul he's trying to launder, I don't think there's any other souls involved. I think Robert Moses is trying to make himself—"
"Sofia: Dang, I have this really good theory, I guess I'm just gonna..."
Kingston: A new soul so that he doesn't—
Pete: Can sell it to Heaven?
"Kingston: Maybe, maybe a third place?"
Sofia: You're right.
"Brennan: You that Nod speaks up and says,"
"Nod: If you wanted to investigate, remember, those three realms, Hell, Heaven, and Faerie, all used to be dreams before they were so loved that they became real, so--"
"Sofia: Are there any other, oh my."
Kingston: Can we go to Heaven?
"Misty: Again, I don't feel super great about going, let's go to Hell! Hell sounds great! It's warm."
"Brennan: You see that Nod smiles and says,"
"Nod: Misty, I would never send you into harm's way, but there are some neighborhoods where those doors—"
[Lou sneezes]
"Brennan: Bless you. Says,"
"Nod: There are some neighborhoods where those doors used to be, so there's a big faerie neighborhood up near Carnegie Hall where the Road to Faerie starts."
"Misty: Oh, great, do they have mana there, do they make, I just have not had a good drink of mana."
"Brennan: You see Nod kind of like goes, you see that Helen actually, no, Helen, your mermaid waitress, says,"
"Helen: Oh, they do a Manahattan there that'll knock your socks off."
Misty: Oh!
Sofia: Oh my god.
Misty: I love a Manahattan! This is what's so great about New York! You take these fusions of ideas and foods and thoughts and dreams!
"Brennan: And you see that Nod also says,"
"Nod: Way far into Brooklyn also, the Pearly Gates are near there as well. You could go—"
Sofia: Oh.
"Nod: You could, or where the Pearly Gates used to be before they left, but there are forces around there, it's the border of the Dreaming where it borders on these other realms if you wanted to go and investigate."
Sofia: I wanna…
Pete: Could we investigate these three spots and then use the bagel with what we found?
"Sofia: Yes, I think that's a good idea. I do feel compelled to also meet up with my brother. As much as I don't wanna see anyone from—"
"Misty: Can we get him to come over to Brooklyn? We can tube or, oh, where's Hell? How do we get to—"
Ricky: Hell's Kitchen?
Misty: Hell's Kitchen?
"Brennan: You see that, yes."
Ricky: Got a clue.
"Pete: Hey, good job, man."
Sofia: I thought it was gonna be Staten Island.
Misty: You did it.
Pete: I've grown to really like Ricky. He's just honestly pure.
Misty: He's just a good boy.
"Pete: I was waiting for the other shoe to drop, and you to be a piece of shit, but—"
"Misty: You know, sometimes you're just a skeptical person, and you're like, there's no way that this guy is this nice."
"Pete: I read people, I read people for a living, you know, and I was just waiting for it."
Ricky: Oh. [nods understandingly]
"Brennan: You see Nod says,"
"Nod: There's a bunch of ground for us to cover while we're here. Also at some point, Pete, and anyone else is welcome to come as well, I know that you've been struggling with your magic. I would love to fix that up for you. We could head over to the Metropolitan Museum of Memories and give you all the knowledge of arcana of all the past Vox Phantasmi."
"Pete: Yes, I would really appreciate that."
Sofia: Oh my god.
"Pete: [haltingly] I try to do a good job, okay. I work hard, and really the only thing I'm good at is drugs. Okay?"
"Sofia: Hey, don't say that."
"Pete: [about to cry] And so sometimes when I'm not doing good at something else, I go back to what I'm good at, I dip back in the well."
Ricky: You know...
Ally: My hand instinctively reaches to a Ziplock bag and I whip it out.
"Kugrash: Don't, don't, you don't—"
"Misty: Hand 'em over, kid, hand 'em over. Hand 'em over, I'll take them for safety's reasons. [winks]"
"Pete takes out a bunch of drugs, including one massive one the size of his whole waist."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Misty: And the other one, and the other one."
Pete gives at least one of the drugs to Kingston.
"Brennan: Pete hands out all of his drugs and you see that each time you empty a pocket, you see that Nod, each time you empty a pocket, Nod fills one of your pockets that is empty with material components for spellcasting so like, a little bit of magic gold dust and a deck of tarot cards covered in runes and a bunch of dope magic shit starts going into your pockets."
"Pete: The backpack, here."
Ricky: Awesome jacket.
"Kingston: Damn, Pete, you look much thinner."
Kugrash: Yah Pete. I thought you were kind of a chunky kid but you’re thin.
Pete: What do you mean?
"Kingston: You just went down, exactly."
Sofia: I thought you were stocky.
Pete: I just had kilos on me at all times!
Kugrash: Very thin!
Kingston: You just dropped 22 pounds!
Pete: Stop it!
"Misty: Does anybody have a bag of infinite holding 'cause actually, this stuff is very heavy and I'm a small old lady."
Ricky: I can carry it. [puts the drugs on like a backpack]
"Pete: I feel so much lighter, everywhere."
"Kugrash: Pete, if you can't make money now, I'm sure Wally, you know, might have a place for you to crash. He's kinda—"
Sofia: I've also got that guest room in Staten Island.
"Pete: Cool, cool. Yeah, I… Well, I was kinda staying with Kingston."
Kingston: It's still open to you.
"Pete: [whispering] Yes! [normal] Cool, yeah, then I'm sorted, thanks."
"Brennan: Cool, so you see that you guys wrap up, you see that Helen comes over with the check, puts it down, you see that Nod looks up at you and says,"
"Nod: [whispering] I rule this entire realm but I don't have any money, I'm a kid."
"Pete: Oh cool. Um, yeah, we can help out."
Emily: I take out a Visa gift card.
Brennan: You put it down.
Sofia: Dale got this for me for my birthday and I've been waiting to spend it.
"Brennan: Helen runs the thing, you come over, you sign for the check."
Kugrash: Your husband got you a Visa gift card?
"Sofia: Yeah, I told you things weren't going well."
"Kingston: That's progress, you know. That's progress."
"Sofia: Thank you, I know, I've had it for a while. Feels good to spend it."
"Brennan: You see, You see the check is settled up, and Nod smiles and says,"
"Nod: While you are here, none may harm you. Feel free to cover as much ground as you like. I've told you the location of the other paragon doors, if you wish to go and investigate them."
"Misty: And, just to double check, again, Faerie, just generally distrustful of riddles and twisted words, is there a person or a being called None who can harm us?"
"Nod: You're so good at this. No, there's nobody that's gonna harm you."
Misty: Okay! What about Nobody? Is Nobody gonna hurt us?
"Brennan: You see Nod goes,"
Nod: I don't know.
"Misty: God dammit. Well, we'll see."
"Sofia: Yeah. I'll be mistrustful if I encounter any… I have a question, while we're here, can we spy on other people's dreams?"
Nod: Yeah.
Sofia: Holy shit.
Nod: You can do that.
"Kingston: Yah, but you'd have to go all the way to Staten Island."
"Brennan: You see that Nod says,"
"Nod: Shouldn't be hard, you can all [cheerfully, arms up] fly! Up up and away!"
"[whooshing, exciting music]"
Lou: Can I fly?
"Brennan: Kingston, you can't fly."
"[jangly, sad, minor chord]"
Lou: I can't fly?
Siobhan: Can I pick up Kingston?
Brennan: You can pick up Kingston.
Ricky: I got his bottom right arm.
Kingston: I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
"Siobhan: You each have an ankle, you're just like--"
"Brennan: And then Nod looks at you and says,"
"Nod: Pete, you wanna head over to the museum?"
"Pete: Yeah, sure! The Museum—"
Nod: The Metropolitan Museum of Memories.
"Pete: Memories, cool."
Brennan: Rad. So where are you guys all taking off to? We'll start with whoever wants to go wherever.
Lou: Some of us should go to the Fae and some of us should go to Heaven.
Murph: Yeah.
Ally: And Hell?
Lou: I think we're good on Hell.
Ricky: I can…
"Kugrash: I feel like I kinda belong in Hell, I'm a bad guy. I could go to Hell."
"Zac: Could I go to the Statue of Liberty, just to check it out?"
"Emily: I have a question, so I can't talk to my brother right now 'cause we're in the Dream World, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, that's correct."
"Sofia: Okay. Where would we go to spy on someone else's dream, I'm not saying I'm going to do it."
"Brennan: You see Nod says,"
Nod: You just have to find 'em.
"Sofia: Oh. But if we couldn't find them in real life, it'd probably be equally hard to find them in Dream World."
Nod: It'd probably be easier to find them here.
"Sofia: Hmm, okay."
"Kugrash: So if you need some support, I'll go with ya if you wanna—"
"Sofia: No, I'm thinking of a selfish mission that has nothing to do with the greater good."
"Pete: Sof, I have a completely fake set of online accounts to stalk my ex and it always sounds like a good idea but boom, five hours is gone, its 4:30 in the morning, there's a piece of pizza on your chest 'cause it's resting there while you scroll and it's just, you got nothing there."
Sofia: Yeah.
Pete: You know?
"Sofia: You're right, that's a dead end."
Pete: It's not worth it—
Sofia: I'm gonna end up with pizza on my chest.
Pete: The past is dead and buried. Focus on the pizza.
"Sofia: Focus on the pizza, thank you so much, Pete."
"Misty: Men are dessert, you know? It's nice to have 'em but you don't need it."
"Sofia: Oh my god, I love you."
"Kingston: That's fair, I'll take that, I believe men are dessert."
Sofia: Yeah.
Pete: I don't...that's gross.
"Ricky: What, I'm a firefighter, I could just go to Hell."
Kugrash: You wanna go to Hell?
Ricky: Yeah.
Pete: Whoa!
"Kugrash: Wally, you wanna go to Hell?"
"Sofia: You know what, I'm gonna go to Hell."
"Wally: Okay Dad, sure thing!"
"Kingston: All right, so is everybody going—"
"Misty: Look, Faerie is gonna be much more fun."
Kingston: I'll come to Faerie then.
Misty: Great.
"Sofia: So no one's going to Heaven, I'll go to Heaven then I guess."
"Brennan: You see that Alejandro says,"
Alejandro: I will keep you company to Heaven.
"Sofia: Okay, yeah."
"Brennan: So Alejandro and Sofia are going to Heaven, Kugrash and Ricky are going to Hell, Kingston and Misty are going to Faerie, and Pete's going with Nod to the Metropolitan Museum of Memories. Let's go ahead now and see—"
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: Where we go first. Cool. Awesome. Ricky and Kugrash, you guys head out with Wally and Ox. You make your way all the way to Hell's Kitchen."
Murph: Our two familiars.
"[cast laughs, a little sarcastically]"
"Brennan: Hell's Kitchen is fully burning. Huge [gargling] just like raging fire here, it's like Nightmare has a lot of pull in this realm."
"Zac: I got just a rag out, and I put some water on it, and just kinda [covers his mouth]"
"Brennan: You're walking along, you hear a [whip cracking] Yah! Yah! And you see that there's a bunch of demons crouched like gargoyles around here and again, you're not in Hell, you're in Dreaming, so these might be demons or they might be nightmares that are wearing a demonic guise. Whatever the case, it looks like it's sort of elementally-aligned with that place and you see that a gate opens up, [ringing] you hear a [bang] shot go off, and you see thousands of little rat men looking much like Kugrash looks, same height, same kind of build, all wearing suits start running after a sack of money strapped to a little zipline like at a dog race, going [panting] and all these rats [thumping] start going and you see that they're knifing each other and biting each other."
Ricky: This is a rat race?
"Kugrash: Ooh, this isn't subtle at all. Fuck. This is, that's me."
"Brennan: You see that one of the guys looks over and goes,"
Randy: Holy shit! Bruce Kugrich!
"Kugrash: How you doing, Randy?"
Randy: I'm out of the race!
Brennan: You see he's holding his guts spilling out of a slit stomach.
"Randy: Holy shit, man!"
"Brennan: Slap slap, bloody handprint on your little cape."
"Randy: You look good, man, how's it going?"
"Kugrash: Yeah, man, you look great, life was awesome when we were partying all the time and shit, right?"
"Randy: Dude, are you still alive?"
Kugrash: Yeah!
"Randy: [incongruously excited] Dude, I lost all my money in 2008 and I blew my fucking brains out in a closet, dog!"
"Kugrash: Holy shit, man!"
"Randy: [laughing] Dude. Hey, do you have any money?"
"Kugrash: No, I live in the trash."
"Randy: Fuck, dude, I hear that. I found I'm always in pain, dude."
"Kugrash: Dude, me too. Life sucks so goddamn bad."
"Randy: We are fucked, dude."
Kugrash: We are so fucked.
Randy: We are so fucked.
"Kugrash: I've got my son Wally, got to reconnect with my son!"
"Randy: Hey, do you have any money, dude?"
Brennan: And you see he takes a little knife out.
"Kugrash: Don’t, no, don't give him money, Wally!"
"Randy: Ah, dude, my feet are always burning!"
Murph: I try to smother him.
"Randy: Ah, it fucking hurts, dude!"
Murph: I try to kill him.
"Randy: Oh, we gotta go, dude!"
"Brennan: And you see they start taking off. [squeaking, panting]"
"Lou: Aw, shit."
Emily: This is fucking horrifying.
Ally: Yah.
"Brennan: You see, Ricky, do you have your Divine Sense active?"
Zac: I can...
"Brennan: Or no, actually, both of you guys make a Perception check for me."
"Murph: Cool. I'd also like to, I still wanna see if, 'cause I'm seeing all these rats. I was turned into a rat by Gabriela, I guess I wanna see if I sense any kind of witch magic or anything like that."
"Brennan: Mm-hmm, go for it."
Murph: Perception...
"Zac: I got perception, 20, not nat."
Murph: I got a 17.
"Brennan: Cool. You're looking for magic stuff, you're looking for the Perception stuff. You see that it seems like there is still some connection, like you could reach Hell through this place. Your axe is gleaming very brightly and you actually hear your axe kind of saying to you, you for the first time hear your axe speak,"
"Axe: [dramatic, low] This is a wicked place. Ricky—"
Ricky: [lifts axe to his ear like a phone] What's up?
"Axe: I'm saying this is a wicked place, Ricky Matsui."
"Ricky: It's a wicked place. Kugrash, I got a call on my axe."
Kugrash: Okay.
Ricky: This is a wicked place.
"Kugrash: Just so you know, I think it means wicked like bad, not wicked like awesome. Just so you know."
Ricky: [to the axe] Do you mean wicked like bad—
"Kugrash: He means bad, he means bad."
Ricky: Or wicked like cool?
"Axe: Wicked like bad, it's a bad place."
"Ricky: Oh, okay."
"Brennan: You start to notice something,"
Emily: I love the one plugged ear.
"Brennan: Which is as you're looking for witch magic, you see that the thing that turned you into a rat, that magic, weirdly, has a sense of justice or purpose to it."
Murph: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: Like, you were turned into a rat because you deserved to be. The reason you became a rat is because your soul already looked like this. In other words, that spell didn't—"
"Murph: If I was a good guy, it wouldn't have worked."
"Brennan: If you were a good guy, it wouldn't have worked. And the reason that your body turned into, in other words, Gabriela didn't turn you into a rat, Gabriela made your body take the form of its soul and you were destined to look like this and had you died, you would have been with these rats."
"Kugrash: Thank you, Gabby. Fuck me."
"Brennan: You see, you also notice and see little sort-of burning scraps of money flitting around and as you look, you see this weird thing, Nod is already kind of ephemeral, but you see, at the corner of your vision, dollar signs moving around. Ephemerally, even for Dream, they're illusory but you look up and see in the distance, the Golden Door hanging in the sky over the city and you see that literally, the thing far away in the harbor that the torch of the Statue of Liberty is lifting towards, she is pointing to the Golden Door hanging over the city and as you look up, you see there's something there that's gonna require you to look for magic, basically, but you get a feeling of—"
Zac: Can I?
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: Can I go to the torch of the Statue of Liberty?
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys can fly over, absolutely."
"Murph: Yeah, I wanna see that."
[whooshing]
"Brennan: You guys fly out. You start flying there and you see the statue turns to you,"
"Statue of Liberty: [very French accent] Hello hello, how are you doing this way, looking to see Statue of Liberty, are you here for our guided tour?"
"Ricky: I'm not here for the guided tour, I wanted to talk to you about the Golden Door and also your torch. What's going on with your torch?"
Statue of Liberty: I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door.
Zac: I hold up my axe.
Statue of Liberty: Oh!
Ricky: Similar.
"Statue of Liberty: Tres bien, it's good to see you!"
Ricky: It's good to see you.
"Statue of Liberty: You are one of New York's bravest, yes?"
Ricky: I'm just doing my job.
"Statue of Liberty: To spend your life saving those who are still doomed to die, it is an act of heroism but also of loss. You are truly a hero, Ricky Matsui."
Ricky: [shaking his head] Okay.
"Brennan: You see that the statue turns to you, Kugrash, and says,"
"Statue of Liberty: Ah, and you a sturdy little rat man!"
Kugrash: Yes.
"Statue of Liberty: You have come here to see where I point. You can see the Golden Door. But, there is something dark at work."
"Brennan: You guys, from this vantage point, you see that the Statue of Liberty casts this incredible glow over the city and you see that there is something issuing from and towards the Golden Door and she illuminates almost this sickly, branching cardiovascular system that appears to be overlaid on top of Dreaming and you see, like blood moving through veins, thick green dollars moving all throughout this realm. You see that they go towards the Golden Door and come from the Golden Door as though a heartbeat over the city."
"Ricky: Is this like the wants of people? Are people dreaming about, is this like greed?"
"Kugrash: Being corrupted by money, yeah. Could we—"
"Ricky: People are always just dreaming about the things they want, right?"
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see that the statue says,"
"Statue of Liberty: The Golden Door, beyond it is a life worth living, prosperity, opportunity, the things that people came here to seek. And yet, that dream, however pure, it can be accomplished through these acts of power and wealth. The danger of course lies in losing the dream in the pursuit of your ability to obtain the dream."
"Brennan: And Kugrash, the second she says that, you think back to your early life and what made you want to be rich in the first place. To, you know, have the power and wealth to determine your own life, freedom, your family, having them go to whatever college they wanted to go to, and at some point in the pursuit of whatever lay beyond that door, you were unfaithful to your wife, you abandoned your kids, you never went home, and you see that the Golden Door is shining but this weird overlay of rooting money is in and of itself like a virus that has wedged itself in between the door and the people seeking it and is feeding off of the dreams of this city."
Kugrash: Deep. Let's fly up and get a closer look at that.
Ricky: Okay.
Kugrash: Ball of dollars. To put it poetically.
Emily: Ballers. [giggles]
"Brennan: You guys fly closer, go ahead and give me an Investigate check."
"Zac: Oh, not Perception."
Murph: Come on. 16.
"Zac: Investigate, 14."
Brennan: You guys snoop around up there. Are you guys using any magic or spells at this point or no?
"Murph: I'm getting pretty low on spells. You know what, I might, I think I do have a level 1 spell left. I'm gonna cast..."
"Zac: Eating wasn't a short rest, right?"
Brennan: Eating was a short rest.
Zac: Okay.
Emily: Mm!
Murph: I wanna try to cast Cure Wounds on this virus money that's up in the thing.
"Brennan: You cast Cure Wounds and you see that a lot of the money shrivels and turns to dust under your hand as it would do, you think, with certain healing spells working on, it's hard to say, you wish you could've gotten a better glimpse of it, but as you burn it, you get a smell of the burning money, Ricky, and a similar smell flashes into your head that you smelled a little bit at Bethesda Fountain and it is the smell of undeath."
Zac: I cast Divine Sense.
"Brennan: You see [blowing] this weird, infected blood system in the Realm of Dream and somewhere deep within it in the tangle, as it goes downtown, there is some force of undeath that is tapped into this and is not fully responsible for it but is able to command it to some degree."
"Kugrash: The vampires, right?"
"Ricky: Seems right, yeah."
"Brennan: And that is all that you guys are able to glean from there. And we're going to cut over to Sofia! So how's it going, you and Alejandro are flying on just like—"
"Emily: As we're flying, I just wanna turn to Alejandro and say,"
"Sofia: Alejandro, I got pretty fucked in that fight and then we had a short rest and, you know, I can roll the dice as it were to see how much I, but you have like a heal on you or anything like that?"
"Alejandro: I have nothing on me, I'm afraid, so—"
"Sofia: Kay, all right then."
"Brennan: You, arriving, Sofia's mind is also on Dale, right? At this point?"
"Emily: No, no, that was a good pep talk that they gave us."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: So I'm not, it's kinda like I use the gift card, I feel like I took a step in the right direction."
"Brennan: Cool, you get to the Pearly Gates, you fly all the way off into, you're actually near, you see that the Pearly Gates are kind of hanging over where JFK Airport is."
Sofia: Oh my god.
[magical sounds]
"Brennan: And you see that sort of through there, you see there's like [whooshing] airplanes kinda coming in and out through Dream."
"Emily: Okay, I like that."
"Brennan: And you see that there's a bunch of people that kind of are passing away in New York City that get into this little airport and take off, you see way in the distance there's like pearly gates."
"Siobhan: Wait, you gotta pay five bucks extra to take the air train to heaven? Goddammit. Everything in this city is a grift."
Brennan: [laughs] You and Alejandro look out and are looking up at these pearly gates. Go ahead and give me an Investigate check.
Emily: Okay. Hmm. It's gonna be 7.
"Brennan: So you're kind of just sort of flummoxed by it, you're looking around, this place doesn't feel as, you know, Heaven, the force of celestial, and you see too, the Pearly Gates, you can even sense through there's other divine realms too, like maybe it's the Pearly Gates to Heaven but there's also maybe the Roman Elysium past there, maybe Valhalla somewhere past there as well."
Emily: Ooh.
"Brennan: There are all of these realms but of reward and peace and lives well- lived. You are kind of taken in by the peacefulness of it and just the sort of [blowing] of these dreamy airplanes. Alejandro kind of smiles along with you and goes,"
Alejandro: Some day I am going to go through those gates.
"Sofia: What do you think is on the, where do you think your plane lands?"
Alejandro: Where does my plane land?
Sofia: Yeah.
"Alejandro: It lands on a runway next to beautiful buildings and happy people, kids playing out on the street with hopscotch, and my wife."
Sofia: Wow.
Alejandro: I have missed her for quite some time.
"Brennan: As you say that, you suddenly hear,"
Angel: Sir! Sir sir sir sir!
Brennan: [thumping] And you look and see a commotion up at the Pearly Gates. You see a bunch of angels absolutely getting their asses kicked.
"Sofia: [claps] Alejandro, let's get into this!"
"Brennan: He looks up and says,"
Alejandro: I think if we go there we might actually die. That's beyond Dreaming. That is Heaven through there.
"Sofia: Okay, well someone's in need, so we should probably go."
"Brennan: You see some insane [thumping] and in that sort of anime way, a bunch of [shouts] angels all fly back in a circle at the same time."
"Sofia: Oh my god, this is like a Renaissance painting."
"Brennan: And you see Dale, in a little white short sleeve button-up shirt, little skinny black tie, black pants, thick black-rimmed glasses, kicking a bunch of angel ass, and charging out of the pearly gates and zooming with this incredible otherworldly leap, [blowing] tears streaming down his face. Dale has the most cherubic, handsome boyish face and is just jacked as hell, incredibly muscular with a couple little, you know, little name tag for the accounting firm where he used to work and he [blowing] bam! Lands on the ground in front of you."
Emily: Can he see me?
Brennan: He can see you.
"Sofia: Dale, what the fuck are you doing here?"
"Dale: Listen, I don't have a lot of time, sweetie. They're gonna drag me back there in a second."
Sofia: I don't understand. I thought you were with Isabella Infierno.
"Brennan: He reaches out, takes your hand, and says,"
"Dale: That text was very sweet. Sweetie, I would never. I've been there."
Brennan: And he points to the Pearly Gates.
"Dale: Isabella is the reason that you haven't seen me, but not for the reason you think. I haven't been in the Waking World for quite some time."
Sofia: So you're in Dream World?
"Brennan: You see that you can hear angels coming. He looks down to you and says,"
Dale: Sweetie. I know this is hard and we don't have time. I'm not alive anymore.
Sofia: [quietly] That's really fucked up.
Dale: I'm sorry that I left. You know it wouldn't have been my choice. I'm so sorry.
"Brennan: He looks, the angels are coming closer, he's like,"
Dale: You'd have to be crazy to leave Sofie Bikes. And I got your text. I wish you the best too.
"Brennan: You see tears stream down his face. He goes,"
"Dale: When you get to the top, I know what it'll seem like, but there is someone there, there is someone there."
Sofia: The top of what?
Brennan: You see angels grab onto his arms and begin to pull him back.
"Emily: I'll fight the angels. I attack an angel, I use all my Ki points attacking an angel."
"Brennan: You see Alejandro says,"
"Alejandro: I cannot, I am a bystander to this, I'd rather not attack an angel."
"Brennan: You see that as you're hitting the angels, each time you wallop one of them you see they go,"
Angels: I get it! Fair! I'm not taking it personally!
"Brennan: As [pounding] But you see, eventually, go ahead and give me an Athletics check."
Emily: I got a 23.
Brennan: That's not gonna beat a Nat 20.
Emily: What? No they didn't!
"Siobhan: They're angels, baby."
"Brennan: You see they restrain you and they're bleeding from the nose and they're like,"
"Angel: We do not hold it against you, we know that you're coming from a place of rage, we get it, and we're not gonna be assholes."
"Sofia: Oh my god, do not speak down to me!"
"Angel: Hey, no one's speaking down—"
Sofia: But don't tell me you're just doing your job here!
"Angel: We can't, he's gotta be, he can't be coming down here."
"Sofia: [crying] He has a job to do on Earth! He's got deer in the backyard to watch, who's gonna watch the deer?"
"Brennan: You see Dale is almost back at the Pearly Gates and he yells out and he says,"
"Dale: Also, what's the problem with a Visa gift card, you know what you like the best!"
Brennan: And [blowing] disappears.
Sofia: It was very practical!
"Brennan: He says,"
Dale: I try to always be practical! Tell Jackson I said hi!
[whistling]
Sofia: Jackson?
Brennan: All of this—
Sofia: What the actual fuck? My husband is fucking dead?
"Brennan: Alejandro looks around and says,"
"Alejandro: Well, this is a lot to process."
"Sofia: Oh, oh okay, let me, sorry, let me fucking hold your hair back while you fucking process this. My husband's fucking dead! I thought he left me and now I find out he didn't leave me which is a cool thing but you know what's worse than that? Him being dead. So let me hold your hand through this, Alejandro."
"Alejandro: [mumbling] So what I said, I do take back. [mumbling] That was the wrong thing to say."
"Sofia: Yeah. I thought you might, we've all said wrong things and this was your fucking turn. Wait, so Isabella Infierno killed my fucking husband?"
"Brennan: As you say that, you feel a crackle of something around yourself and [squishing] a bunch of magic wraps around your fists as you say that."
Sofia: I'm gonna fucking kill her. And I don't think she's going to the great big airport in Brooklyn.
"Brennan: We're gonna cut from there over to Glamour. Over near Carnegie Hall, this incredible three-story very swanky faerie bar [whooshing] appears and it is just decked out and gorgeous. This is very much one of those Broadway, where the stars come to drink kind of place."
"Siobhan: I am gonna cast Disguise Self on me just because I don't want anybody snitching to Titania but it's, I'm just basically like Eliza Doolittle at the beginning of fucking..."
Zac: Dr. Doolittle?
"Brennan: Oh, ""My Fair Lady?"""
"Siobhan: ""My Fair Lady,"" thank you, I was like, ""Pygmalion,"" that's not right. So I just have very obvious dirt splotches across my face and then a very silly little hat with flowers coming out."
Ally: I can see my dick!
Brennan: Incredible.
"Misty: [exaggerated London accent] Blimey, this bar—"
Ally: That’s not Dr. Doolittle.
Kingston: Do you want me to call you something else? Are you still Misty or...
"Misty: How 'bout Liza? Cor blimey, look at this bar then!"
Brennan: You see a little--
Misty: Cor blimey!
"Brennan: You see that riding a little pot of gold is a tiny little leprechaun, crazy red muttonchops and a bowler hat with a shamrock."
Leprechaun: [very Irish accent] Right on and welcome to Glamour! Ho ho! Bring! [coins jingling]
Brennan: Gold everywhere!
Leprechaun: And can I be gettin' ya a drink then?
"Misty: Yeah, I'll take one of your Manahattans, please!"
"Leprechaun: One Manahattan coming right up and for you, sir?"
Kingston: I'll just take water?
The leprechaun stares at Kingston with a flat expression for a moment.
Misty: He'll have a Manahattan too!
"Leprechaun: [singing] Oh, the days of the kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune!"
Siobhan: I stand on the bar and start [waving her drink back and forth].
"Leprechaun: [singing] Oh, for one of those hours of gladness! Gone alas like our youth too soon."
Brennan: [magical sounds] Two beautiful sparkling faerie drinks appear in front of you. Are you crying?
Ally: [wiping their eyes conspicuously] I'm fine.
"Brennan: These two drinks appear. Yeah, two Manahattans appear. They are delicious. Go ahead and roll Investigation checks, what are you guys checking out while you're here?"
"Siobhan: Ooh, Investigation I have very low."
"Lou: I have very high,"
Kingston: What are we looking for?
Misty: [normal voice] I don't fully understand.
"Kingston: I mean, I guess we just came to have two delicious drinks."
Misty: I'll have another round of Manahattans!
"Brennan: Cool, you guys just get fucking blasted, I guess. You guys fully..."
"Kingston: What are we doing here, no, we're supposed to be looking for something, what are we—"
"Misty: See, those are the thing with Faerie, you come here for one reason and then you're like, oh, god, I can't remember."
"Kingston: We're looking up what you see about, oh, we should—"
Misty: The door!
"Kingston: And his soul, we should be seeing about--"
Misty: The soul.
Kingston: The soul is there.
"Siobhan: Is there anybody around here that I feel like, let's roll for an investigation check."
Misty: Have you got any tiny nuts?
Lou: Modified 20.
"Brennan: You see, a modified 20."
"Siobhan: I also got a 10, that's pretty helpful, right?"
"Brennan: You see that the leprechaun goes,"
"Leprechaun: Oh, you want some snacks then? [singing a cheerful Irish jig]"
Misty dances along.
Brennan: And you see that a little ring of perfect red with white spot mushrooms grow out of the bar in a little circle.
"Leprechaun: And good to eat they are, and good for ya as well!"
"Misty: Oh, thank you, [to Kingston] maybe you shouldn't eat these. I don't know what the human digestive system would do."
"Kingston: Yeah great, I, you know, am good."
"Misty: I love, thank you, this is my favorite!"
"Brennan: You see in a long, beautiful navy peacoat, this coifed, stunning man with purple eyes and sort-of elven ears, at the end of the bar, speaks to the leprechaun, and he comes over with another two small things of little absinthe shots with floating Lucky Charms in them."
"Misty: [exaggerated accent again] Well, thank ya kindly, good sir! We are two but humble normal people here."
"Kingston: Yeah, we're both humble and normal."
"Brennan: You know that this guy, this person at the end of the bar, clearly is in some awareness here and you can also tell Kingston, Dream Land or not, you know when people are new to town, and this guy's new to town."
"Kingston: Hmm. Oh, what's your name, sir?"
"Bobby: [New York accent] Oh, it's nice to meet you, my name's Bobby Goodfellow."
Kingston: Oh!
Bobby: New Yorker born and bred.
Kingston: Mmm.
Misty: [whispering] Ask him if he's related to Robin Goodfellow.
"Brennan: The second you say that, you recognize this person's eyes. The form is different but the eyes are the same and you speak to the Puck himself."
"Misty: [normal accent] Oh, hello. Darling, it's so good to see you."
Bobby: Good to see you. I understand that I guess all of our mutual glamor's fallen away.
"Misty: Ah, well, you know. L’chaim!"
"Bobby: Hey, sláinte."
[sipping]
Kingston: Do you know each other?
"Bobby: You might've read about me. Puck, Robin Goodfellow, if we shadows have offended, think but this and all is mended?"
"Misty: He does a great bit where he pretends to be a stool and then whips himself away at the last minute. If that's ever happened to you, that was probably him."
Bobby: That's me.
"Misty: It's a great bit, it's a great bit, every time you do it, it's funny."
Brennan: You see that the costume of Bobby Goodfellow disappears and there is a tiny little butterfly-winged goat satyr boy standing there with fuzzy ears with a little wineskin hanging around his bare chest.
Misty: How's that bitch Peaseblossom?
"Brennan: He says,"
"Robin: [London accent] Oh, she's just awful, she's always chattering on—"
"Misty: Oh god, still?"
"Robin: Terrible, yes, true! [seriously] Listen, love. I've come to tell you she's coming for you."
Misty: How?
"Robin: You got my mirror, didn't you?"
Misty: That was your mirror?
"Robin: Sorry, gotta do what the orders are, Lord Oberon demanded it."
"Misty: [disapproving] Oh no, she's not back with Oberon, is she?"
"Robin: I think they're just fucking, I don't think that they've moved in together again."
"Misty: God, it's the worst when they're together because then they're like trying to one up each other with helping but it just fucks everybody else over and then, ugh, it's exhausting."
"Kingston: You're talking about all the characters in the play, right, the play you're doing? These are real people?"
"Misty: Yes, I mean Shakespeare was a great bard and spent a lot of time in his youth in Faerie."
"Brennan: You see that Robin looks at you and just goes,"
"Robin: I've come to warn you, right?"
Brennan: And looks around [whooshing] puts Bobby Goodfellow back up.
"Bobby: Darlin', you gotta understand, you owe centuries of glamor. She's coming for you and she's coming for the Don as well. [waggles his fingers] He has not been paying his taxes like he should."
"Misty: [exaggerated accent] Darling, I get my glamor from the people of New York City and all of the bridge and tunnel people that come and watch my shows, I don't owe nothing to Titania."
"Bobby: Well, you and her are gonna have to hash that out."
"Brennan: You see this is like the most theater bar in the world 'cause everyone's changing their disguises and doing accents for each other. Someone's all,"
"Faerie: [Scottish, camp] Right no, a Scottish accent's like this, no this, no this, like this, no, deeper, deeper, from the resonant here."
Brennan: Just a bunch of faerie actors all talking to each other.
Siobhan: Nightmare.
"Brennan: He looks over at you and says,"
"Bobby: Also. You gotta know, sweetheart, Titania's heard. Something's happening in New York. The world of mortals is not long for this world. Come home. We miss you."
Misty: [groaning] Ah.
"Kingston: Hey, buddy, what was that? What was that you said about the world of mortals?"
Bobby: Hey. Best of luck to you.
"Brennan: You see he looks and says,"
Bobby: You wanna throw in your lot with a bunch of humans?
"Misty: I mean, look. Here's the great thing about humans. They're mutable, they're changeable, everything in Faerie is just always the same and then you're just there and you're immortal and then you're like, I guess I'll throw out these flower petals on the bed again 'cause that's the thing that I do every day and then I'm, it's like, the only, that's why people are always doing tricks, you know, 'cause it's so boring there, it's like, well, all I can do is go to the mortal realm and fuck with people!"
"Brennan: You see that Bobby Goodfellow says,"
Bobby: Your call.
"Misty: Aren't you… baby, come here, I have a great agent and I'm sure he would love to see you come and play in New York."
"Brennan: You see he smiles and says,"
"Bobby: When the chips are down, remember who your people are, Misty."
Brennan: And vanishes.
Misty: I will! I'll remember!
"Brennan: You see that [blows] he vanishes and Kingston, you look around at all these faeries looking at you like they know something that you don't."
"Kingston: I don't like this place. I felt like I had no, I'd like to leave. Can we go?"
"Misty: Folks, if you wanna learn an authentic New York accent, you talk to my friend Kingston Brown over here."
"Brennan: A bunch of faeries,"
Faeries: Teach us your accent! Teach us his accent!
"Kingston: No, I'm good, I don't really, I don't really have one, I don't talk like… I don't, goodbye!"
"Brennan: You split, awesome. Pete, you head over to this incredible museum that is in the middle of Central Park where in real life there is no museum, it's halfway between the Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It's resting there, it's at a weird, funny little angle, and you see that there's all this magic pouring into it of all the memories of people in New York."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: And Nod, actually says,"
Nod: Come on in.
Pete: Is there entry or is it like a pay what you can kinda thing?
Nod: There's a suggested donation but—
"Pete: Fuck yeah, let's go. Let's just go walk right in, just kinda, you know."
"Brennan: And you see Nod kind of pulls out their little dress pockets and a little dream moth flies out, and you see it says,"
"Moth: Bunch of bums, you’re bums!"
Pete: Art should be free!
"Brennan: You fucking walk in and start looking at this place. You feel, as you walk in here, your wild magic surge at the vampire club coupled with your True Strike that you cast on Robert, as you're walking through the thing of memories, you start hearing his voice in your head but you think that it is not him talking to you. You think you might have fucked him up so much with your explosion that you're walking around in his mind right now."
"Ally: Okay, like the room I'm in is his mind."
"Brennan: Yeah, well you can feel him in your mind as you start walking through all these exhibits and the exhibits are of the incredible deeds of all the previous Vox Phantasma that have been in New York City. And Nod just starts to kind of show you things, the art kind of comes to life and moves around, it's like the dopest museum you've ever been in because all of the exhibits are moving and changing and chimeric and flowing. And we can actually update two things on your sheet right now."
Ally: Cool!
Brennan: You are proficient in Arcana as of this exact moment as you begin to absorb all the memories of the previous Vox Phantasma.
Ally: What does that mean? What does it go up to?
Brennan: You add your proficiency bonus.
"Ally: Oh, sick."
Brennan: Add your proficiency bonus.
Ally: Damn! Yeah!
"Brennan: Aw hell yeah. And Nod asks you as you start to absorb all this awesome and you are fully getting, like you see this rich woman in the 1920s throwing these giant parties and making the dream of the Gilded Age come to life and you see Emma Lazarus in the mid to late 1800s writing ""The New Colossus"" and this dream of America being this place and people coming to New York to start a new life and basically that each Vox Phantasma has summoned forth this time of dreams and change and chaos and it was up to them whether that chaos would change things for better or for worse."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: You see that, as you're running through, Nod says,"
"Nod: For your magic, I leave it up to you. Do you wish to have the wildness of your magic be restrained or do you wish to embrace it and by embracing it, seek to mold it towards your vision?"
Pete: Ooh.
"Brennan: You see that Nod explains,"
"Nod: You will, if you choose to restrain it, your bursts will happen more infrequently. If you choose to embrace it, they will happen as often, but you may have some say in how they manifest."
Pete: I like that. So far they've been great. They've really protected me and looked out for me but what's the worst thing that could happen in a wild magic surge?
"Brennan: You see that Nod, they shrug and go,"
"Nod: Chaos is chaos. Dreams have a role to play in the Waking World and sometimes, it shakes things up."
Pete: Could I kill everyone I love?
"Nod: There's a risk of that, but, whether you choose to embrace it or restrain it, you will have powers at your disposal to help you avoid that."
Pete: I say embrace it.
[whooshing]
"Brennan: You continue to roll Wild Magic normally, but now you will roll with advantage on the D100 that I roll back here."
"Ally: Oh, cool."
Brennan: Meaning that you'll get two possible effects and you can choose between them.
"Ally: Fuck, cool!"
"Siobhan: God, that's dope."
Emily: Yeah.
"Ally: That's awesome. Fuck, Yah!"
"Brennan: Yeah, you see, you're beginning to understand your magic, you're learning it and teaching it."
Ally: I reach into my pocket and pull out a little baggie but it has cherry tomatoes in it.
"Brennan: Pop a cherry tomato. Nice healthy snack, you're learning your shit."
Pete: Ricky's got a lotta great tips.
"Brennan: As you walk through, but yet you do hear Robert's voice partially and you're partially in his mind."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: As you walk through, you see you enter a little hall here 'cause this is all the memories of everyone that's ever lived in New York. You do see a hall here and see that there are names on the exhibits of Kugrash, Misty Moore, Ricky Matsui, Sofia Lee, and Kingston Brown."
Ally: I look at them.
"Brennan: You think that it's getting late, late as the hour of the day, you could probably have time for one."
"Ally: [sucks in a breath] I mean Kingston, duh."
Brennan: You begin to walk through Kingston Brown's life.
"Ally: I feel bad that I'm doing this but I'm just like, that's the person I'm connected with, for better and worse, the most."
"Brennan: You walk through and you hear two voices running through you. It gets really weird and trippy here as you're going into someone's active memories. You hear Nod speaking and at the same time, you hear Robert's subconscious mind speaking as well, like almost as though he is unfocused and getting weird images of this, not in his conscious mind, but in his subconscious somewhere."
"Ally: Oh, wait. If I'm doing this, will Robert then have some of Kingston's memories at his disposal?"
Brennan: You don't think so.
"Ally: Okay okay, cool cool."
"Brennan: You think that weirdly it's like, you just have a weird connection to Robert now because you surged on him so hard."
"Ally: Cool, cool cool."
"Brennan: You start to go through Kingston Brown's life. You see, you know, in the late 60s, early 70s, a young boy running through the streets of Harlem, surrounded by family and community."
"Pete: Ah, look at you."
"Brennan: Lou, you see passing images of things. Lou, I'm gonna throw a curveball at you right here,"
Lou: Of course.
Brennan: I'm gonna ask you to play Kingston Brown throughout the ages.
Lou: You got it.
[soft jazz]
"Brennan: You see Kingston Brown as like a six year-old watching as a young girl on this playground outside of a public school is crying over in a corner with a skinned knee, having been pushed down by some of the other boys here on the playground. What does Kingston, young, seven, eight year-old Kingston do?"
Kingston: Excuse me?
Young Girl: Yeah?
Kingston: Do you need a band-aid?
Young Girl: They wouldn't let me play the game with them.
"Kingston: Hey, that's fine. Kids can be mean but we can get that patched up, and then we can play."
Brennan: You see [whooshing] the scene shifts to Kingston—
Pete: What a good guy.
"Brennan: Kingston giving up his own recess to walk this little girl to the nurse's office and showing up there and being there with her while she gets a band-aid on her knee. We cut over to [whooshing] Kingston in his sort of teenage years, a little bit younger. You see that Kingston, this is a time in your life where your grandmother, who's no longer with you in the present day, is very ill, and you see that there's a meeting at school where there is sort of a teacher talking and speaking to both of your parents, Winston and Victoria, and saying,"
"Teacher: Kingston is a very gifted athlete. We would be able to take him around the country, you'd travel around, he would obviously not be able to be here in New York, but this is a potential for Kingston to really shine."
Brennan: And you see your parents kind of look at each other and look at Kingston.
"Kingston: I can't. Not when Grandma's sick. Maybe we can talk about it in the future but, I'm sorry, but I need to be here."
[whooshing]
"Brennan: We see a Kingston in his college years speaking to an admittance counselor to high school saying,"
"Counselor: With these scores, Kingston, if you're interested in medicine, you could be a doctor, you could be making hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, I mean that's hyperbole, but you could be making a lot of money."
"Kingston: Yeah, but the problem, I mean, is there anywhere in my neighborhood where I could stay because I'm not really trying to be too far away, I mean, especially 'cause I know it's about eight years of school and that's just a long time to be so far."
"Counselor: But we're talking about scholarships to Cornell, we're talking about places where you could… Think of yourself!"
"Kingston: Yeah, I mean, that's easy to do. But there has to be a way to make this work here."
[whooshing]
"Brennan: You see a Kingston around the age of 30. This whole time in your head, you hear Nod going,"
"Nod: Dreams and the Waking World. You represent the force of an individual's dream, the need for a person to be themselves and shine their own light. Kingston represents the other side. He has always and forever made the choice to serve those around him."
"Brennan: And you hear Robert going,"
Robert: Fuckin' schmuck. Look at this fuckin' idiot. Every advantage and opportunity thrown away and for what?
"Brennan: And you see [whooshing] Kingston is 30. There is this insane dragon on Bleecker Street, like this long, multi-legged dragon handing him this subway token and saying,"
"Dragon: [deep, important voice] You will be the Vox Populi of New York City."
"Kingston: You're gonna have to say that again, Vox what?"
Dragon: You have given of yourself time and time again
"Brennan: And now images staggered up and up and up, just like Kingston missing a party to help someone move, Kingston showing up at someone's doorstep with food, Kingston showing up at a rally for the neighborhood, Kingston showing up at City Hall to speak on behalf of people that can't speak for themselves, like over and over and over and over and over again and the entire city, you can hear,"
"New Yorkers: Thanks, Kingston, thank you, thanks, Kingston, thank you, thank you."
"Brennan: And all of those ""thank yous"" [whooshing] flooding into Kingston's body, and you hear Robert in your head say,"
Robert: No. Everybody's got one time they do something selfish. Everybody's got one time. They make the call to enrich themselves. That's in our nature.
"Brennan: And you see a young Kingston Brown looking at Liz Herrera walking down the street and Nod saying,"
Nod: To invite her into his world would be taking all of what was destined for her and forcing her into the madness of the Unsleeping City.
"Brennan: But you see this bond of true love connecting the two of them and you see Kingston's heart break and reach out and he and Liz twirl around in memory until many years later, you see him and Liz and Liz saying,"
"Liz: We could have a house, we could have a car, we could have kids!"
"Kingston: I can't leave the city. I've explained this before, all right, you can go but I have to be here."
Liz: Where are my… You could get your doctorate and we could have a good life together.
"Kingston: I don't, that's not a good life. Not for me. My good life is here. And with you. But it has to be here."
"Brennan: You see she looks and says,"
Liz: Then I think our lives shouldn't be together.
"Brennan: And vanishes, and you see that images of possible futures, you're at the edge of memory now, going back into dream, and you see Kingston with an ephemeral changing happy child in his arms and that [whooshing] vanishes. And you hear Nod say,"
"Nod: Dreams and the Waking World, often at odds."
"Brennan: And Robert says,"
Robert: Only a fool would give up what he wants. Look at all that that idiot sacrificed and for what? To be alone and sad.
"Brennan: And [whooshing] vanishes, and you are at the exit of the museum."
"Pete: Whoa, dang."
"Brennan: You see that Nod holds your hand and says,"
"Nod: Dreams and wishes are your domain. Not Kingston's, I'm afraid."
"Pete: Yeah, dang. Well, cool. I feel like I understand him a lot more."
"Brennan: You see that Nod sort of agrees and goes,"
"Nod: I think a lot of what's different about you probably makes sense. Kingston's given his whole life to make sure that people and places and communities thrive based on his effort and sacrifice. But those things, like family and community, were never there for you."
"Pete: Yeah. Yeah, I don't have that connection at all. Whoa."
"Brennan: You see Nod looks and says,"
"Nod: I know I'm not supposed to say this because I'm [points up] Team Dream, but there's something to be learned from both, I think."
"Brennan: And you guys come back from your various quests and missions. You guys appear back at the L Train. Wally gets it moving again, Nod waves and says,"
"Nod: I'll see you guys in a little while, I'll be here and again, I'll keep this place as safe as I can."
"Brennan: You guys look variously blasted from Manahattans, and also extremely haunted."
"Ally: I go straight up to Kingston like,"
"Pete: Kingston, look, I went to this museum and I got to pick one person from the party whose life I could go through—"
Misty: [singing] I wanna be a part of it!
Pete: And I picked you and I feel like I've seen a lot of things you didn't tell me and I'm sorry.
"Misty: New York, New York!"
Kingston: What?
Ally: And then I hug you.
Kingston: Aww. [hesitantly pats his back]
"Brennan: As you leave Dreaming and cross Dreaming to the Waking World and Pete gives you this hug, your see that both of your magics intertwine, intermingle, and for a second, Sofia, you look and see that yin and yang from the Monastery of the Midnight Sun complete above their head and something broken in New York is made whole. You continue on your way, you've arrived back at the Union Square Subway Station."
"Misty: There's a great pizza place and I really want some pizza, just, on University Place, just right by the bookstore, we could… Does anybody wanna buy a book?"
"Ricky: We saw, we saw--"
"Kugrash: Yeah, we saw some kind of greed money ball as it were, not the film, or the book."
Pete: I love that...
"Kingston: You guys watched ""Money Ball"" during this?"
"Pete: You guys just watched ""Money Ball?"""
Misty: I love that movie.
"Kugrash: We didn't watch ""Money Ball!"" We think that"
Ricky: I could go watch that movie.
Pete: With skinny Jonna?
"Kugrash: Greed, okay, greed--"
Sofia: Wish I watched fucking--
"Kugrash: Greed has some part to play in what's going on here, there was some kind of sort of cosmic greed that was sickening the city and we, there was blood, cursed blood too, it's vampire stuff, it seems."
Pete: Hmm.
Ricky: I think I'm just gonna drink this 1000 hour energy right now.
Pete: Cool.
Ricky downs it.
Kingston: Should we head to that—
"Kugrash: What's it, Sof, are you okay? You look shocked and angry."
"Sofia: Doesn't really affect any of your lives, but my husband is dead."
Pete: What?
"Sofia: He didn't actually leave me, he was killed."
"Misty: Oh, that's good— is that bad? Is that good?"
"Sofia: Or killed, I don't know, honestly, we didn't really speak in, it was all sort of vague--"
Misty: So what's up with that bitch who stole your husband? Do you want us to go fuck her up?
"Sofia: Yeah, I do wanna fuck her up."
Kugrash: What?
"Sofia: I don't even know though, if she killed him or—"
Misty: I'll fuck her up!
"Sofia: I think she killed him, but I can't even leap to those kind of conclusions, all I know is that he did not, in fact, leave me and he is, in fact, dead."
Zac: Do I still have Divine Sense active?
"Brennan: Yes, you do, yeah."
Zac: I'm just wondering if there's anything near.
"Brennan: While you guys are looking around, you guys are also still very fucked up from the battle so you guys might wanna like head home and rest and recuperate and stuff like that. The next day, you guys see that actually, this next day—"
"Siobhan: Ah, thank god."
"Brennan: Is the 20th of December, which is Priya's art show over in Brooklyn."
"Ally: Oh, great. I've given the Polaroid around to everyone as the invite and only Kugrash refused."
"Kugrash: I'm not fucking taking, that's weird--"
Pete: It's cool!
Kugrash: I'll crawl through a fucking vent before I do that.
"Pete: Ah, come on."
"Brennan: So you guys all have this invitation to this art show that you're headed to. That day, before the art show, some people, I'm sure, have stuff they gotta do, Sofia."
Emily: I wanted to stop by and see Mario. I think I'll probably still go through the motions of that.
"Brennan: You find Mario on Staten Island. He's not there with the whole family, but you stop by the family house while Mario's there."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: He looks up and goes,"
"Mario: Hey, Sof, finally, geez, cancel at the last minute, what's the fucking deal? You got started to look at some alligator shoes, I actually think I fixed the prob."
[tense bass music]
"Sofia: Okay, I don't need this whole fucking dog and pony show, I'm honestly more of a cat person, so just get to the fucking point of it. What the fuck is our family doing consorting, also how long have you been seeing the Unsleeping City and you never once thought to mention it to your sister?"
Mario: Look. We fucked up. You know that Dad had ties to the mob for a long time. We pushed our luck a little bit and got into the Confettis. There's something going on with Confetti and there's a representative from—
Sofia: Is it Robert Moses?
"Brennan: He looks shocked that you know that name. He goes,"
"Mario: Basically, Robert… Robert asked us to shuttle money, launder it from the Confettis, and by money, I mean crazy shit like baubles and you know, chunks of magic shit and all this crazy stuff that was part of stuff that Confetti was paying to a representative from Hell. This is a person who's been working with Moses for a long time."
Brennan: Make an Insight check.
Emily: 15.
Brennan: He's—
"Emily: Oh, I'm sorry. Actually, 17."
"Brennan: He's treading carefully around a thing that has to do with Dale, you can tell."
"Sofia: Okay. Again, just be way more direct, I know that Dale is dead, I know that he's not with Isabella Infierno, I don't know what the fuck happened but I have a feeling that you do."
Mario: Okay. You know how you often called Isabella Infierno a succubus?
"Sofia: Yes? It was small of me, I know, I hate it when women go after other women—"
"Mario: Sofie, Sofie, shut up shut up shut up."
Sofia: I know there was—
"Mario: Sofie, it's not, no. You—"
"Sofia: Look, I don't need you to preach to me why I was—"
"Mario: Sofie, she is a succubus!"
Sofia: Oh my— Nod.
[cast laughs]
Ally: Oh my Nod?
Brennan: Oh my Nod.
"Mario: Sofie, you were fucking right. Isabella was a succubus. We were laundering money from the Confettis to her and Dale was—"
"Sofia: To her, she's the representative?"
Mario: She was sent from Hell to look at—
Sofia: So she's tied in with Robert Moses.
"Mario: Yes. And Dale started, you know, Dale was an accountant, and he started looking at the books and adding things up and he got close and—"
"Sofia: So who called the shot to have my husband killed because right now, I cannot confidently 100 percent say that it was not my own fucking family."
"Mario: Look. Did we know it was gonna happen? Yeah, but he wasn't from the neighborhood. He was not right for you. He was a... he was a… You know, he was a, this… You know that he was into some kind of magic, right? He was like a chosen one from this monastery or whatever. He was some champion who was trained to stop something or other and he was fucking around and he was nosy and he got his nose into some bad people's business. Did we do it, no. Did we call the shot, no."
"Sofia: All right, well, the only reason I'm not gonna go after you right now is because I'm not organized enough to give you the fucking revenge you deserve."
"Brennan: You see that he just sort of shakes there a little bit and he's like,"
"Mario: Sof, if you go after Isabella, you got no idea how fucking powerful she is."
Sofia: Maybe you should've said that to Isabella before she went after me.
Brennan: You see… You hear a purring behind you. [purring] And raised hackles and extended claws.
"La Gran Gata: Mija. Let's go hunting together, you and I."
"Sofia: Yeah. I'm ready to sniff out, not rats though, rats are my friends. Kug is a rat, we're not going after rats."
La Gran Gata: We could get some rats later.
"Sofia: Okay, no rats, can we just do mice instead of rats?"
"La Gran Gata nods, appeased."
Brennan: You see—
Sofia: Okay.
"Brennan: And you take off into the city. The rest of you guys variously show up at this old Brooklyn brownstone loft art space. Ricky, immediately you're looking around, and it's like, the windows are barred with iron and there's no active sprinkler system and—"
Ricky: [thumping on the wall] I don't know.
"Pete: We gotta go in, man, come on."
"Ricky: We do, okay. But if I see anything, I'll say something."
Pete: Okay.
"Brennan: You guys enter the space. You know that Priya wanted to talk to you here. You look up into this loft space and see a bunch of people gathered around this kitchen table and you see that there's also a roof party sort of upstairs. As you go, Priya goes,"
"Priya: Peter, darling, I'm so glad you're here. Come with me."
"Brennan: And she takes your hand and leads you through this art space to this table in the middle of a bunch of onlooking people and has you sit down and says,"
"Priya: I present to all of you, ""Cruelty: An Exploration of a Relationship."" Peter, put your hands in my hands."
"Pete: Not only is this so fucked up, this is a pure ripoff of a very popular performance art piece. This is so dumb."
"Brennan: You see everyone gasps and Priya goes like,"
Priya: What the fuck is wrong with you?
"Pete: If you're gonna publicly fuck with me, at least let it be original."
[cheering]
"Siobhan: [clapping] Yes, bitch!"
Brennan: You see—
"Kingston: [yelling] Picasso is art, this is bullshit!"
Sofia: Is there free wine at this?
Brennan: You see as Kingston—
Ricky: This place is not up to code!
"Brennan: As Kingston yells that, you feel your heart, Kingston's approval of this moment fully heals your broken heart."
"Ally, grinning fiercely, takes a deep breath and lets it out, relieved."
"Brennan: You can write down on your character sheet, ""Over Priya Danger."""
Ally: Yeah!
Brennan: Sofia—
Siobhan: Her last name is Danger? I hate this bitch.
Sofia: Priya Danger.
"Brennan: Sofia, you burst through the door downstairs and with that, I think, we'll decide where some of you are in a moment. Who is, there's also a big rooftop party where there's food and stuff, who thinks they would be upstairs at the bigger party with the food, who thinks they'd be on the middle story watching Pete and Priya?"
"Siobhan: I mean, I'll always see a show."
Brennan: [points to Siobhan] Middle.
Lou: Pete.
Brennan: With Pete.
Murph: I'm probably on the roof.
"Brennan: On the roof, scarfing food. Sofia, you burst through the lower level."
Zac: It's just two levels?
"Brennan: Three levels, there's a rooftop party happening as well. Actually Sofia, you have crazy jumping, I'm gonna say that you probably show up on the roof as well."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: With La Gran Gata.
Emily: I think I'm just jumping roof to roof.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: Any time that there's a rooftop party, I'm grabbing a drink along the way. [sipping]"
"Ally laughs and, with their fingers, mimes a little person jumping between buildings and stopping to sip."
Zac: I think I'm at the entrance to the second floor.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: 'Cause like, figuring out what's okay."
"Brennan: Cool, awesome. Rad. You, as you say this the people start [cheering] Ricky, you're looking around. You smell smoke."
Ricky: Fire! Everyone!
"Brennan: You hear up on the roof, Sofia, a voice say,"
"Isabella: Oh, Sofie Bikes. I didn't think you were classy enough to go to an art show."
"Brennan: And you see Isabella Infierno, and all around her on the roof [whooshing] fire and people scream."
"Sofia: This from a fucking woman who went to a David's Bridal, bought a dress, and doesn't even have a wedding?]"
"Isabella: [offended] I do have a wedding. Just not to your stupid, dead husband."
"Emily: I mean, I attack her."
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: Roll initiative! And that's it for this episode of The Unsleeping City. Tune in next time, where things heat up at this art show. See ya then!"

"Brennan: Ah, there's a fire in the building! The downstairs is already fully engulfed in—"
Lou: Holy fuck.
"Brennan: You see a water tower, this is an old condemned building, there may be water in it, there may not be. You breathe in the noxious smoke."
"Sofia: Oh my god, I'm gonna go down before I kill this bitch."
Brennan: A bunch of artsy devils appear.
Siobhan: These guys have already fucked us up so much and I don't know how to stop 'em.
"Kingston: Willy, is that you?"
Art Devil: Is this your dog? Dalmatian?
"Ricky: Yeah, why?"
Isabella: All of you fucking bitches are gonna burn. You're all gonna burn.
Emily: You fucking kidding me?
"Siobhan: What, are you fucking kidding me?"

[RECAP]
[glass shattering]
Wally: Rat Jesus.
Kugrash: It's—
Wally: You're my dad?
"Kugrash: I'm your dad, I'm your dad."
[cries and wails]
"Sofia: What the actual fuck, my husband is fucking dead?"
Nod: Robert is moving against New York City.
Ricky: What is Robert's deal?
"Nod: Mr. Moses wanted wealth and power above all else, and therefore sold his soul to Hell and to Faerie."
Pete: Whoa.
"Mario: Sofie, you were fucking right. Isabella was a succubus. We were laundering money from the Confettis to her."
"Sofia: To her, she's the representative?"
Brennan: You see Isabella Infierno and all around her on the roof [mimics explosion] fire and people scream.
[people screaming]
Emily: I mean I attack her.
[END RECAP]
[dramatic techno music]
"Brennan: Welcome one and all to The Unsleeping City, here at this poorly managed loft scene art party in the heart of Bushwick. We see our intrepid heroes, say, ""Hi"", intrepid heroes."
All: Hi intrepid heroes.
"Brennan: Emily is dead-eyeing me, like she's going to kick my ass in real life."
"Ally: Fuck you, Brennan. [laughs]"
"Siobhan: Fuck you, Brennan."
Emily: [growly] You killed my husband.
Ally: You're going down.
"Brennan: Last we left off, we learned that after a wild adventure in the land of Nod, our intrepid heroes learned of the golden door, of paragons of dream, of the infection at the heart of the golden door, of the death of Dale, Sofia's husband. And Pete,"
Emily: [sadly] R-I-P.
Brennan: Coming into his own at the Metropolitan Museum of Dreams and finally ascending and mastering the powers of the Vox Phantasma. [puts fists together as if to show off knuckle tattoos] Phantasma for life.
"Ally: Fanta, the soda. I spelled it wrong."
"Brennan: At a terrible art party, Pete's ex has just attempted to use the trauma of their co-dependent relationship to launch a very horrible performance art piece where they would interrogate each other about the harm they had done to each other, Pete was not having it. However,"
Ally: [whispers] Stupid.
"Brennan: Isabella Infierno has shown up here with a party assembled and Ricky Matsui smells fire. We enter initiative, Sofia, you are the first to act."
"Emily: Yes! Okay, I would like to curse Isabella Infierno."
Brennan: Cursed.
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: And then I'm just gonna attack her.
"Brennan: Uh, rad, so you rush across the roof here."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: That's definitely your movement, she's surrounded on all sides by fire, so to get her you'll have to be standing in flame."
"Emily: Yeah, that's fine."
[Lou chuckles]
"Kugrash: Ehh, Sof!"
"Sofia: I don't care, fuckin' come heal me."
Kugrash: Jesus.
"Sofia: If I get hurt, I hit for more."
Murph: I think my job this fight is gonna be to have Sofie not die.
Ally: Yeah.
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Go ahead and make a Dexterity and a Constitution saving throw for me.
Emily: [giggling] Dexterity's gonna be 10. Constitution's gonna be 5. Can I do a quick reaction for Shield?
Brennan: This is just the fire burning.
Emily: Okay.
Zac: Okay.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: You take 2 points [engine powering down] of fire damage and you suffer one level of exhaustion. The smoke goes into your lungs, which is gonna give you disadvantage on ability checks as you breathe in the noxious smoke."
"Emily: Oh my god, I'm gonna go down before I kill this bitch. Okay, well okay, so I got 2, and then I got one level of exhaustion, okay."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: Is that gonna be an issue for when I'm actually attacking her?
"Brennan: No 'cause it's not attack rolls or saving throws, it's just ability checks right now."
"Emily: And then if I disengage out of the fire, am I gonna save myself some burn and then go back in, or am I gonna keep getting burned every time I go in and out?"
"Brennan: Every time you make contact with the fire or start your turn there, that's gonna be damage."
"Emily: Okay. [clears throat] [dramatic upbeat music] All right, I'm going to attack this bitch. Aww, fuck me, fuck me. Does a 15 or a 13 hit?"
Brennan: 15 and 13 do not hit.
[Zac sighs]
"Emily: Okay. Then… Oh, I got a nat 20 with my backhand."
"Ally: Nice, nice."
Brennan: Cheers.
[group cheers]
"Emily: So that's gonna be 5, 10, plus 13. So that's gonna be 13 with my backhand and since I made, since I hit with a melee attack and then I'm also gonna Stunning Strike her. So she has to do a Constitution saving throw. So I hit her for 13. It is fucking magical because ki runs through me now."
Brennan: Ooh! She fails.
Emily: She’s stunned!
"Brennan: Great, that is awesome. And then 13."
"Ally: Do you have anything left to like to get out of the fire, or is it—"
Emily: No.
"Brennan: That was it? Okay, cool cool cool cool."
Emily: Chow mein. Do I have a reaction?
"Brennan: She's stunned for one round, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: No, she's stunned for… stunned until the end of my next turn."
Brennan: Stunned until the end of your next turn.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Gotcha, okay."
Siobhan: Sick.
"Brennan: Rad,"
Siobhan: Fuck her up.
"Brennan: Well, Isabella cannot take actions or reactions but Isabella can take bonus actions. You wallop Isabella with a backhand and she disappears, vanishes."
Emily: Fuck.
Brennan: In a puff of sulfur and brimstone.
Lou: You got a solid backhand in there before.
Emily: I know.
Ally: 13? Pretty good.
"Emily: And I stunned her, so she couldn't do anything. I don't wanna watch fucking win."
Lou: Something about being a backhand feels substantial.
Emily: Yeah. It's cattier.
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yes, that's going to be Misty. Speaking of Misty."
"Brennan pops the top off of part of the art show’s set, revealing a hallway."
[dramatic music]
Ally: Hmmm.
"Emily: Oh, la, la."
Siobhan: Wow.
"Brennan: Pete, Priya, Ricky, you're over by the stairs, you got Ox next to you, Kingston and Misty, you're over here. Misty, it's your action."
"Siobhan: Um, okay. I'm gonna, first of all, wink. I'm gonna say to Pete,"
"Misty: Pete, you're too cool for this dick of a girl. You cool!"
"Pete: God, fucking thank you."
Misty: Yeah.
Pete: You're speaking my exact language.
"Misty: Thank you, man! Am I doing it right? I'm trying to pick a—"
Pete: I love it.
Misty: Great.
Siobhan: And I give Pete Bardic Inspiration.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Siobhan: And then, I would like to cast Fear on Priya which is a wisdom saving throw."
Brennan: Rad.
Siobhan: And my DC save is 15.
"Brennan: Fear actually happens in a giant ass cone, I believe."
"Siobhan: Yes, it is a 30-foot cone. But I don't fucking care about anybody else. I'll move so that I don't, I'm not."
"Brennan: Oh, you just want to blast Priya."
Lou: Is that a 30-foot cone?
"Siobhan: I mean, and anybody around Priya, 'cause all of these fucking art fucks, I don't care."
[Brennan chuckles]
Zac: Do we know if she's attacking us?
"Brennan: You're not cer— You can make an Insight check if you want to see, if you think Priya constitutes an active threat."
Siobhan: I feel like she deserves to.
"Ally: Thank you, thank you."
"Siobhan: I mean, that's Fear cast on her."
"Emily: Fear is like, doesn't really do damage."
Brennan: She's gonna make a roll.
Ally: And before you do it.
"Siobhan: I mean, on everybody around her, you know."
Brennan: Cool. Yeah.
"Ally: I look at her and I say,"
Pete: You fucking rip off. So many people have ripped off Marina Abramović and you know so little you probably think you're ripping off Shia LaBeouf!
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: She [screams loudly] screams. Misty, you step forward. What do you say to Priya?"
"Siobhan: So it's the personification of her deepest fears. So I would like for all of these people, their deepest fear is their parents turning up to tell them that their trust funds are being cut off."
[Ally laughs]
Brennan: Everyone in here erupts into the most— [Ally screams loudly] terrified [screams].
"Hipsters: No, my art! I need that money to make art for the world! [screams]"
Brennan: And Priya turns to flee for the staircase.
Priya: My trust fund! I've never told anyone about my trust fund!
Misty: We all knew!
[Brennan laughs]
"Pete: I could have guessed. Oh, your rent? Your $1600 rent? Somehow always got paid?"
[Brennan laughs]
Brennan: Incredible. That's gonna be Kugrash.
Murph: Is this? Was the fire around Isabella or is it gone?
Brennan: The fire remains.
"Ally: It's peeking up right here, too. I think it's everywhere."
Brennan: You can see the fire licking up the staircase.
Murph: Okay. Do I see if there's water in this little water tower thing? I just wanna make sure I don't do a trap.
Brennan: Make a Perception check.
"Murph: Okay. Not great, 12."
[drum beats]
"Brennan: You see a water tower. This is an old condemned building. There may be water in it, there may not be."
"Murph: Okay. I'm gonna, I guess. I don't wanna waste a turn. If I look around, does anyone else seem like an immediate threat?"
"Brennan: Up here? Not that you can see, no."
"Murph: Okay, since I don't even know what's going--"
Emily: Just come grab me out of the fire.
"Murph: Yeah, that's true. Can I climb up and I'm gonna try to knock the water tower thing over."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: [laughs] Yeah.
Brennan: How are you going to do that?
"Murph: Oh, boy. Oh, boy. How do I want to do that? I guess I'm gonna turn into… [laughs]"
Ally: Could you shred a hole in it instead of dumping the whole thing?
"Murph: Oh, yeah."
Emily: That'd be good.
Murph: I could do that.
Siobhan: Turn into a bear and break into it?
"Murph: I'm gonna turn into, I wanna turn into an ape."
Emily: Sick.
"Murph: And then like, climb up and try to, like—"
Emily: Woo.
"Murph: I guess, get up there and feel out what I can do. Either knock it over or punch through it or whatever."
"Brennan: Okay. You're gonna turn into an ape. So I'm gonna say that you turn, [drums beating] keeping with the New York theme, you turn into a little miniature King Kong."
Emily: Aww.
Brennan: Complete with little tiny biplanes [planes buzzing] flying around your head.
"Kugrash: [laughing] Hey, get out of here. Get the fuck out of here."
"Sofia: Oh, Kug, you always know how to cheer me up."
"Brennan: Cool. You Wild Shape into an ape and then you could either try to destroy the structure, which is gonna be incredibly difficult, or like open a spigot."
Murph: I want to open it.
Brennan: Which will be less water but will be some.
"Murph: Okay, I would like to open it."
"Brennan: Cool. You have a climb speed as an ape. You make it all the way up here. Go ahead and I'm gonna say to do this, use the ape's stats and you're gonna make a Sleight of Hand check, try to open this thing up."
"Murph: Okay. So Dex, so 16."
"Brennan: You go and boom! [fist bangs] Hit the spigot off and water begins to burst out of the water tower, [water rushing] hitting the roof here. I will say, actually, 'cause you’re trying to send it to the fire over here, right?"
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: You bust off a spigot over here. Make a Dexterity attack roll, no proficiency for me."
"Murph: Okay. [slow drum beat] God damn it, 5."
"Brennan: Okay, cool. It splashes over here [water splashing] and hits this place next to Misty but not on Misty. This fire vanishes."
Siobhan: Sofie.
Murph: On Sofie.
"Brennan: Sorry, on Sofie. Yeah, the water goes down, does not hit Sofia, it hits the space next to Sofia. As [fire whoosh] the fire continues to burn that's Kugrash."
"Murph: Real quick, as a minor action, this is for something later, I'm not just being ridiculous, can I see if I can find a spiderweb or any little spiders? This is for a spell later."
Brennan: Go ahead and make a Nature check.
"Murph: Okay. Yeah, come on. 20."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: Not nat, but 20."
"Brennan: You do, yeah, there's plenty of spiderwebs up here on the roof."
Murph: Hell yeah.
Brennan: Cool.
"Kugrash: Come here, my little babies."
"Brennan: That is now going to be Priya's turn. Priya bolts with fear, gets to the top of the stairs where there is an active flame, and shrieks and goes,"
"Priya: Fire! There's a fire in the building! Oh God, my work! All of my original paintings!"
"Brennan: And cannot continue down the staircase. However, a bunch of other beings appear."
[dramatic music]
Siobhan: Shit.
Brennan: Rushing up the steps you see a bunch of artsy devils appear.
[fire whoosh]
Zac: No.
Brennan: She arrives there. Fire springs up in a space next to her.
[fire crackling]
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: This guy appears here.
Ally: Should have gotten fucking Ice Storm. I made a mistake.
Brennan: [laughs] Fire appears next to him. This guy appears behind Pete. Fire is going to appear next to him.
[dramatic music]
Ally: He looks familiar.
[Brennan laughs]
Emily: Who is it?
Ally: I can't tell but he does look familiar.
"Brennan: And then this guy appears [fire whoosh] over here [fire whoosh] with a bit of flame over here. You see flames spreading everywhere. These guys are going to attack. This art devil turns to these and says,"
"Art Devil: [stuck-up] Ugh, plebeian tastes. I'll be happy to split your skull."
[Emily guffaws and gasps]
Brennan: And brutally kills one of the bystanders standing there in that space. [imitates weapon hits and blows] kills them.
Lou: Jesus.
"Brennan: This person is gonna take a swing at Pete's back and go,"
"Art Devil: Where's your taste? Come on, you're at an art show!"
Zac: Where's Pete?
Brennan: Pete's standing right in the center of the room.
Ally: In the middle.
"Brennan: You can see his cowboy hat, there."
Ally: I use Shield.
"Brennan: You use Shield in reaction, cool."
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: So that's gonna bump your AC.
Ally: To 18.
Brennan: You prevent one of the attacks successfully.
[upbeat dramatic music]
"Brennan: Ooh, Pete, that Shield was very clutch. Lashes out at you, though, and does deal 5 points of damage to you with a claw, rending you."
"Ally: Rending me, what does that mean?"
Brennan: Like slashing your skin up.
"Ally: Oh, got you, got you."
"Brennan: One of them is gonna take some swings at Ricky. 11 damage to you, Ricky. From slashing and is gonna try and hit you again. And that's gonna do it."
"Siobhan: Ricky, do you have? You're better against devils, right? As the Paladin?"
Zac: I don't know. I don't think so.
Murph: If they're fiends.
Siobhan: Right?
Zac: What do you mean by better?
Murph: Like do extra...
"Brennan: Ricky, you take 7 plus 4, you take 11 points of slashing damage again. And then you also take..."
"Zac: 11, Jesus Christ, what the fuck is happening?"
Brennan: 20 points of fire damage on top of that.
Lou: Ooh.
Zac: So I'm at 30 already.
Murph: [whispers] Fuck.
[Brennan imitates explosion]
Zac: From 72 to 30.
Murph: We gotta get down there.
[Emily yells]
Zac: That many people just nailed me?
"Brennan: No, one guy just nailed you with an incredibly, it looks like they have some slashing and then you see he whips up some flame, looks at you and says,"
Art Devil: [slight German accent] This whole look. what are we trying to do here? It's like macho New York fire fighter? What about flame?
[imitates fire whooshing]
Brennan: And horribly burns you. One of them takes a swing at Priya.
"Siobhan: So Priya wasn't the bad guy? That's fine. I mean, I still think that she is the bad guy."
"Emily: No, she deserved a little."
[Siobhan's speech drowned out]
Emily: On a macro level.
Brennan: Priya goes down unconscious.
Ally: Great.
[Brennan chuckles]
Emily: Convenient that you're over her.
Brennan: And then that guy took swings on Pete.
Ally: [to Emily] No.
Brennan: And that's going to be...
Ally: Not enough.
"Brennan: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Ooh, I rolled low. The fire on the roof continues to spread. [imitates fire whoosh] And the fire down here continues to spread as well. [imitates fire whoosh] That's going to be Ricky and Ox."
Zac: Can we?
Brennan: Do you want to take a look down the stairs?
Zac: Is that okay? Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, sure, you can peek down there."
Zac: Oh wow.
Lou: That's on fire?
[fire crackles]
"Brennan: Yep, the downstairs is already fully engulfed in flames."
Lou: Holy fuck.
Zac: Is that a family?
Emily: Oh my god.
Brennan: Yes.
Emily: There's like a stone golem or something.
Lou: Jesus.
Siobhan: Is that just a sculpture or is that a...
"Lou: [whispers] Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck."
Ally: Was there something with toilets and bathtubs? What am I thinking of?
Siobhan: That was under the East River.
"Ally: Oh, right, okay."
"Emily: No, but you're right. Why would there be a toilet on the ceiling?"
Lou: I don't know 'cause they're shitty hipsters.
[Brennan chuckles]
Ally: I think we can bust each of these water sources open.
Emily: Yeah.
"Zac: Can I make a Perception check? Just like as a fireman, just wondering like is there anything I can tap into?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and do a Perception check."
"Zac: If there's sprinklers or whatever. Okay, and 19."
Emily: Ooh.
"Zac: Plus, you know, 3."
Emily: 4
"Zac: 4, yeah."
"Brennan: Uh, cool. You know there's like a water tower up on top, buildings like this should have a water tower on top which should be able to go to the sprinklers, in this case it's been disconnected 'cause this is like a condemned building basically. There shouldn't be people in here. It's not up to code. And then, otherwise the only exit is that front door down here."
[dramatic drum beat]
"Zac: Wow. Okay, I think the water tower's the only bet. I think everyone's gonna die."
Emily: I think the water tower.
Zac: I think Ricky...
Brennan: You do also have that Create Water ability.
Zac: Right.
Brennan: So it's a question of there's the water tower which could be able to help out. You don't know that the water tower would effectively cancel all the fire in the place.
Zac: Sure.
"Emily: [claps] Dude, someone's gotta clog one of these toilets so it overflows."
"Ally: Oh, yeah."
Siobhan: I roll a nat 20 on an epic shit.
"Zac: Create Water? It's not like an area, it's just like one?"
"Brennan: You're at 24, right?"
Zac: Yes.
Brennan: You see way down here Isabella Infierno who's like holding a clobbered head down there.
"Zac: Okay, I'm going to shout to everyone,"
Ricky: Listen up you terrible people.
[Brennan laughs]
Ricky: Do your best to get out of here right now. The building's gonna come down.
Brennan: Make a Persuasion check for me and I'll say with advantage.
Zac: Using my municipal authority?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: Ooh, 19 plus 3."
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys see,"
[slow medieval music]
"Brennan: Ricky gleams with like, again giant civic light as ordering people what to do in an active fire is extremely what he was put on this Earth to do."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: And you see even all these terrible hipsters learn and immediately all their pretension fades as the fires spread. And they're like,"
"Hipsters: Okay, thank you sir, you're so buff, thank you."
[Murph and Zac chuckle]
Zac: I'm going to use a second level spell slot to use Create Water.
Brennan: Awesome.
"Zac: Which will do, it only creates 10 gallons of water."
Brennan: Okay.
"Zac: So at that point, we'll do double that. We'll do 20 gallons of water and… But the sides of the cube increases by five feet. So I don't know how big the cube is. It's a 10 foot..."
Brennan: Take a look at this for you?
"Zac: Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool. You destroy up to 10 gallons... Yeah, I'm gonna say that... you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, so yeah, you could probably hit a couple squares with that if you wanted to."
"Zac: Okay, I'd love to hit… Take a five foot step to the top of the stairs."
Brennan: Okay.
Zac: And just like...
Brennan: You see unconscious Priya's right there at your feet as well.
"Zac: I'm going to just do it right there. Like on me and hopefully, it'll run down the stairs."
Brennan: Cool. I'm gonna ask you to go ahead and just make four attack rolls real quick.
"Zac: Okay. 4 and 7, plus my spell modifier probably."
"Brennan: Plus your spell attack, yeah."
"Zac: 3, so 10 and 7. Then [sighs] 5 and 8."
Brennan: So you got a 10 on one of those?
Zac: Yeah.
[Brennan imitates fire whoosh]
[water flowing]
Brennan: You see this bit of fire recedes from there.
Zac: Fuck.
Emily: This fire is so hard to get rid of.
Murph: I think we gotta kill the guys. I don't know.
Brennan: Fire vanishes.
"Zac: As a bonus action, I'm going to, can I see anyone else? Friends wise?"
Lou: You see me and Misty and Pete.
Zac: I'm gonna cast a Shield of Faith on Pete.
"Brennan: Okay, voom."
[dramatic organ music]
"Ally: What does that do again, sorry?"
Zac: And then I'm gonna have Ox attack too.
Brennan: Your AC's up by two.
Zac: Ox is gonna attack the one right next to him. And he gets advantage 'cause he's sitting.
"Brennan: Within five feet, yeah."
Zac: Right?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: Ooh, 16 plus."
Brennan: That's definitely gonna be a hit.
"Zac: Ooh, two 6’s!"
[Brennan guffaws]
Zac: Plus 2 so that's 14.
Brennan: 14.
"Ally: 14, Fuck yeah."
Zac: And I have to make a DC11 Strength saving throw. Or they're prone.
Brennan: That's gonna be… You see that he's not knocked prone.
Zac: Cool.
Ricky: Good boy!
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"Art Devil: Ah, this dog. What a mutt, why you attack me?"
"Brennan: And that's Ricky's turn, it's gonna be Kingston."
Lou: Can I do an insight check to see if this is magical fire or just normal ass fire?
"Brennan: Um, yeah, go ahead and make an Insight check for me."
Lou: 14.
"Emily: Whoa, you got high Insight."
"Siobhan: He rolled a 3, that's wild."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: That’s fucking wild. This fire is being summoned magically but once it's here, it is just burning the building regularly."
Lou: Great. Can I cast Spirit Guardians?
Ally: Yeah!
Lou: And then charge at this one?
Brennan: And charge at this one over here?
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Kingston, you reach into your heart and you see..."
[dramatic patriotic music]
"Brennan: That some of the people in this party are not bullshit hipsters. Some of the people in this party are actual true-hearted New Yorkers. And they feel the call. And a bunch of like, rushing from downstairs and around, some of you guys aren't even really sure where you kind of saw them from. A group of spiritual New Yorkers flock to Kingston's aid."
Siobhan: [clapping] Yes.
"Brennan: You see one of them that goes,"
"Spiritual New Yorkers: You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us."
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: A bunch of Spirit Guardians appear and you're just going for the guy in the blue suit?
"Lou: No, I'm going for this guy who dropped someone over here."
Brennan: Okay. Spirit Guardians appear.
"Ally: Oh, cool."
"New Yorkers: We got your back, Kingston. No problem."
Brennan: Cool. He will get an attack of opportunity on you potentially.
Lou: That's fine.
"Brennan: But I think the way Spirit Guardians works, he also might just take damage 'cause you're summoning it on top of him, right?"
"Lou: An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it makes a Wisdom saving throw."
"Brennan: Okay, so it's about starting the turn there. So, you moved to get into position. What is the radius on that?"
Lou: 15 feet.
Brennan: 15 feet. You can get both these guys in the radius of this if you want.
"Lou: Yeah, is there a possibility for me to stand right here?"
"Brennan: Yes, there is."
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: Move right here. Your Spirit Guardians follow. This guy jumps up on the table. This little kid with a crowbar comes over here.
"Spiritual New Yorker Kid: Got your back, Kingston."
"Siobhan: Wow, that kid should be in school."
[Murph chuckles]
Spiritual New Yorker Kid: It's after school hours. This is extracurricular.
"Kingston: Also he's not a child. He sounds and looks like a child but he's an 18 year old man, choosing to be here of his own volition."
"Brennan: Rad, awesome. So they're not going to be affected by it yet. But on their turns they'll be affected by it. But you do move out of that guy’s thing so he's gonna take a swing at you."
Lou: Great.
Brennan: And misses horribly.
Lou: Great.
Brennan: That's going to be Pete.
Ally: Great. I run over to Priya.
Brennan: Hell yeah. This guy does not get an attack 'cause he already took it so are you gonna go around this way? Because you might have to rush through the fire to be able to do that.
"Ally: No, I'm gonna run straight through this way if that works."
"Brennan: Oh, you're gonna leap over the stairs?"
"Ally: Does that work, yeah?"
Brennan: Yeah. Go ahead and give me an athletics check just to make sure.
"Ally: [whistles] Athletics, 6."
"Brennan: 6\. Okay, you leap to the top of this staircase and kind of stumble up. You take 3 points of damage. Kind of fucking up your landing a little bit. But you do reach Priya."
"Ally: Okay, cool. While there I cast Haste on Ricky. [nyoom!] So Ricky, you get double speed. You get plus two your AC, you have advantage on Dex throws, you gain an additional action each turn."
Emily: Oh my god.
Zac: For how long?
"Ally: It's a concentration spell so I'm gonna try to keep it going as long as I can. And when the spell ends, you lose a whole turn. 'Cause you're fatigued, so sorry."
"Zac: Okay, cool."
"Ally: So sorry, but I'll try to keep it going."
"Emily: Wait but he can't. He's immune to it, exhaustion."
Zac: I'm immune to exhaustion.
Ally: Yeah.
[everyone yells]
Brennan: That's some good—
Ally: Fuck yah.
Ricky: I feel awesome.
Pete: Put out some of these fires and kill people.
Ricky: Great.
Sofia: Maybe soften up Isabella so that I could just go in there with one final killing blow?
"Brennan: My man, there you go."
Brennan hands a spell card to Zac.
Zac: Yeah.
Ally: Is that Haste?
"Brennan: Oh, that's Haste. I'm just gonna hand you that so you know what's going on."
"Ally: Cool. Okay, can I do an Insight check to see if fire would damage these like fire demons?"
Brennan: Make an Arcana check actually.
Siobhan: Don't you have now advantage on Arcana?
Brennan: Not advantage but proficiency.
"Siobhan: No it's, proficiency."
Ally: 10.
"Brennan: You know that they won't be hurt by fire. These are devils. You see other times that other Vox Phantasma have tried to do this and you're like, not gonna fuck up that way."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: Rad, incredible."
Ally: I grab Priya and I get as far as I can. I don't know if that's like my goal.
"Brennan: Cool, make another Athletics check to lift Priya up."
Ally: Great. I've lifted Priya up. That's a 10.
Brennan: [laughs] You get Priya.
Emily: Yes.
"Ally: Oh no, no, sorry. That's Athletics, right?"
Brennan: That's Athletics.
Ally: It's an 11.
Brennan: Ooh! You get in under there.
"Brennan pretends to lift something with his knees (and not his back!), grunting."
"Brennan: Come on, come on, come on."
"Pete: Usually you work with me. Okay, you're unconscious."
"Brennan: You lift Priya up in your arms. Yeah, you are fully carrying Priya."
"Ally: Oh, fucker [laughs]."
Brennan: Now these guys are all gonna go.
[dramatic music]
Brennan: These guys listened to Ricky. They rush over here trying to avoid as much of the flames as possible. These guys rush here. But they're like tryna not bump into people. These guys rush out of the way over here.
Ally: Party-goers.
"Brennan: These guys turn to sprint. They rush partially. But Pete, try to rush past you but can't 'cause it's too crowded over here. And these guys all start sprinting over here for the staircase. [yells] As fast as they can. That's the bystanders. I'm gonna need a Wild Magic roll from you."
"Ally: Oh yeah, right. 11."
Brennan: Cool. That's now going to be Sofia.
"Emily: Me again? Okay, so this block that Kug put out?"
Brennan: Mm hm.
Emily: Is it damaged by fire at all?
Brennan: The block he put out?
Emily: Because the combination of being on fire and then put out. I want to stomp through it.
[Murph chuckles]
Emily: I want to jump up and try to create a hole in the ceiling and then get to the next floor that way.
Siobhan: Sick.
Brennan: Okay.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: If you would like to do that, you can give me an attack roll."
Emily: Hey.
"Brennan: This is, okay, so you want that like weakened part there."
Emily: Yeah.
"[thematic, tense electronic synths]"
Brennan: I will let you do this as an Athletics check or as a attack roll. Your choice.
Emily: I guess my attack bonus is a little bit higher so I'll do that.
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and roll. Let me know what you get."
"Emily: Although, then if, okay, yeah, yeah."
[clears throat]
Lou: You got this.
[Emily sighs]
Emily: Got 14.
"Brennan: Okay, 14 does not hit. You may take your other attacks if you'd like."
Emily: Can I take my other attacks and try to get through it? Again?
"Brennan: If you want to keep busting through, you can do that, yeah."
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna try again. 18."
Brennan: 18 hits. This thing's got a lot of hit points. It's a full building. But you can keep rolling if you'd like.
"Emily: I am going to, all right."
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Can you grab like the toilet,"
Emily: Gotta lot of hit points.
Ally: And then jump off the water tower? Or like drop the toilet off the water tower? So that you don't take damage?
Emily: [yells] I want to do that. Can I run back and then try and throw the toilet through the soft spot?
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: Or am I more powerful than a full toilet?
Zac: Can you just take a full dash action and get down the stairs?
"Brennan: I will say, so you've taken your attacks, if you would like to--"
"Emily: Oh, I didn't roll for damage for that other one."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll for damage. Let me know what you get.
Emily: 13.
"Brennan: 13, okay, cool. Roll that one hit. For your bonus action--"
Emily: And I still have.
Brennan: For your bonus action if you'd like to make and attack with the toilet you are welcome to. If you feel that it might be somewhat more effective to smash a toilet on the ground.
"Emily: [laughing] Okay, I'm gonna."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: Fuck ‘em up.
"Emily: Everyone's looking at me, like don't do this."
"Siobhan: No, I think you should absolutely do it."
"Lou: I'm about it, dude."
Ally: I'm about it.
Siobhan: I’m all about it.
"Murph: If you can break it, we can get the water tower directly down."
Siobhan: Yes.
Emily: I am gonna try it.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: I'm going to grab the toilet and try to throw it.
Murph: I think this is a bad idea.
"Brennan: Cool, make an attack roll."
Emily: Okay.
Lou: Come on.
"Emily: Oh please,"
Brennan: This is your bonus attack.
Emily: I've been rolling like dog shit.
[sighs]
Emily: I got a 4.
"Brennan: Cool. You pick up the toilet, run over and smash. [porcelain breaks] right on the ground. The porcelain scatters, you're about five feet off from the weakened area of the roof. The toilet scatters and is destroyed."
Emily: I'm so mad. I've been rolling like shit.
[groans]
"Brennan: I'm gonna need you to make a, we'll need another Dexterity and another Constitution check from you."
Emily: Okay and it's disadvantage 'cause I have exhaustion.
"Brennan: No, not savings rolls yet. That's only ability checks."
"Emily: Oh, okay. Okay, Dexterity is 24."
"Brennan: Successful, you don't take more fire damage."
"Emily: And then, 18."
Brennan: You do not take another level of exhaustion. But you are probably over here as this little piece of flame comes back.
Emily: Fucking mad. Why am I rolling like shit? I need this to work.
Brennan: Isabella is still stunned til the end of your next turn. Correct?
"Emily: So, yes, she's not stunned anymore."
"Brennan: Cool. Ba-ba-bum, Isabella appears here next to Misty."
"Siobhan: Aw, you bitch."
Brennan: And is going to go after Misty.
"Misty: You come after my friend, you come after me."
[Brennan laughs]
"Misty: Okay, I do see that literally that is what's happening. I'm gonna fuck you up!"
"Brennan: [chuckling] Rad. [rolls, then sucks in a breath] Jesus."
"Brennan starts to look up and speak, but is cut off."
Siobhan: I would like to...
[Lou laughs]
"Siobhan: Before you say anything. Say,"
"Misty: Where'd you get those clothes, Staten Island?"
[Brennan laughs]
"Siobhan: And then roll,"
Emily: Oh my god.
Siobhan: For Cutting Words.
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: So that's a 7, minus 7 to whatever fucking amazing roll that you just did."
Brennan: Her first two attacks miss you. One more attack is coming. That one does hit.
Ally: Minus 7?
Siobhan: No shit.
"Brennan: Yes, even minus 7, that one hits. You take 14 points of damage Misty."
Misty: Is that all you got?
Brennan: And you feel something burst inside of your body. As Isabella kicks you in the liver.
"Lou: Ooh, god."
[Emily groans]
Lou: What burst?
Brennan: I'm gonna need you to make a Constitution saving throw.
Siobhan: Fuck. Thank God I have a great Constitution. That's not true. 13.
"Brennan: At the beginning of your turn, you take 11 points of damage as something bleeds inside you."
[Emily groans loudly]
"Lou: So can I ask, Isabella entered the area of my—"
"Brennan: That's right, you roll damage."
Lou: She needs to make a Wisdom saving throw.
"Brennan: Ooh, doctor. [nods] Mm-hm."
Lou: She takes 9 damage or half if she succeeded.
[dramatic patriotic music]
"Brennan: The guardians around you go,"
"Spiritual New Yorkers: Oh, who the fuck?"
"Brennan: You see she even says like,"
Isabella: Get the fuck away from me.
"Brennan: As she's kicking Misty and they say,"
Spiritual New Yorkers: Wait a minute. That accent sounds pretty similar. You're from fucking Jersey.
Brennan: And start beating [thumping] the shit out of Isabella.
Spiritual New Yorkers: Came over the fucking bridge.
"Brennan: That's Isabella's turn. Misty, beginning of your turn, you got that damage. Now you may take your turn."
"Siobhan: Okay. That's a lot of fucking demons down here, right?"
Brennan: Mm hm.
Lou: Yeah.
Siobhan: Shit.
[dramatic music]
"Siobhan: Okay, so what I'm gonna do is. Misty Step up to the floor above."
Brennan: Mm hm.
Siobhan: I'm gonna grab my girl Sofia.
Sofia: Hey.
"Siobhan: And I'm gonna say,"
Misty: You don't want to be in this fight?
Siobhan: And then I cast Dimension Door and I bring us both down.
[Emily yells]
Brennan: I believe you can't cast two spells in the same round.
Siobhan: Can't I cast a bonus action spell?
Brennan: You can cast a bonus action spell and a cantrip in the same round.
"Siobhan: But I can't cast, damn."
Brennan: Don't believe you can cast two spells in the same round.
"Siobhan: Even with War caster, Fuck. Well, maybe I don't do that then."
Zac: It all works.
"Siobhan: But it seemed cool, right?"
"Emily: It was really clever, yeah."
Ally: It's really the thought that counts.
Emily: Yeah. I honestly appreciated the thought that you even wanted me to be there.
Lou: Cool thoughts.
Ally: Cool thoughts.
Siobhan: Is Isabella Infierno holding anything?
Brennan: She is not holding anything.
Siobhan: Hmm.
Brennan: I'll leave you here for right now.
"Siobhan: Those windows here right? There's windows everywhere? Okay, so I would like to..."
"Emily: Oh, there's windows on the sides of the thing?"
Brennan: There are but they're iron bound so you can't jump through them or smash through them.
"Emily: Oh, okay. Then I don't feel as bad about trying to break the roof with a fucking toilet."
Lou: I still think it was dope as hell.
"Siobhan: No, it was, we were all--"
Emily: If it had worked it would have been awesome.
"Lou: It would have been a coolish, water cascading down,"
[Emily laughs]
Lou: you fucking falling through.
Ally: Perfect.
"Lou: Like fist pull, like ready to go."
"Siobhan: Okay, is there a 30 foot cube where it's just a bunch of demons but nobody that I'm--"
Brennan: You don't know if there's a 30 foot where--
Siobhan: Goddamn.
Brennan: 'Cause it's so packed up here.
"Siobhan: Yeah. Shit, I would like to cast Crown of Madness on Isabella. Uh, no. Maybe one of the demons next to Isabella Infierno."
"Brennan: Okay, awesome."
Siobhan: Maybe fuck it. I'll just try it on Isabella.
"Brennan: You're gonna try the Crown of Madness on Isabella, correct?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
Emily: Fuck her up.
Siobhan: And it's a Wisdom saving throw.
[dramatic music]
Siobhan: DC 15.
[dramatic ringing]
"Brennan: You put the crown on over her head and fire melts it into gold and it wisps away. She says,"
"Isabella: Oh cute little faerie, huh? Listen, we're gonna be sending you back to the town here very shortly. Maybe in a bag? But it will be a nice bag, I swear."
Misty: Nobody calls me cute and gets away with it.
Siobhan: And then I look over to my pal Ricky.
Brennan: Mm hm.
"Siobhan: And I say,"
"Misty: Ricky, did you get buffer? You get more buff?"
Ricky: I think I did.
"Siobhan: Great, and I give him Bardic inspiration."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Zac: It's a d8, right?"
Siobhan: It's a d8.
"Ally: Oh, is it?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, d8 now."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: Kugrash, it's you."
"Murph: Sweet. I yell to— Sofie's the only one up here, right?"
"Sofia: Yeah, well, I'm a make a dash for it next time, yeah."
"Kugrash: Yeah, we gotta stop trying to put out this fire, right? This building's fucked."
"Sofia: I'm not gonna, I'm, yeah."
"Kugrash: Okay, cool. I'm done fucking around."
Murph: I'm going to break my wild shape by casting a spell. I'm gonna cast Giant Insect on my three spiders.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. So that gives you, I think, one giant spider."
"Murph: No, that gives me three giant spiders."
Brennan: Holy shit.
Siobhan: Horrifying.
[Murph laughs]
Brennan: These will be represented by one spider and these two big cockroaches.
Kugrash: Yeah.
Brennan: Where are you putting them?
"Murph: I want to put them near the stairs I guess, so they crawl down the stairs."
"Brennan: Cool. One, you see that a bunch of, I think we can say that they'll have the stats of a spider but we'll put two of these big buff roaches."
Murph: Oh sweet.
Brennan: And you see leading them on a little strand.
"Spider: [posh, deeper voice] Oh, Kugrash, Lord of the Sewers, I'm sorry for bailing on that fight earlier in the bodega."
"Kugrash: Yeah, don't fucking do it again, man."
"Spider: I shall not. As the spider spins its web, so true you spin a tale of adventures here in the greatest city."
Kugrash: You're a bug where I'm a rat. Let's not make it--
Siobhan: Why are all your animals so posh?
Kugrash: I don't know.
Spider: And what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to kick ass. Am I right?
"Kugrash: Yeah, yeah."
Spider: Who's with me?
"Kugrash: Go kill a devil, you idiot."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll initiative for them.
Murph: Sure.
"Emily: Go kill a devil, you idiot."
"Murph: Oh, 18."
All: Woo!
"Lou: Yah, yah, yah!"
"Emily: Wait, why are they rolling damage?"
"Murph: No, no, they're rolling initiative."
"Emily: Ah, ah, ah, ah."
"Brennan: That's going to, that's Kugrash. So that's your action. Anything else you're doing?"
"Murph: No, I'm turning back into Kugrash."
"Brennan: Cool, get rid of that."
"Murph: Actually, you know what?"
Emily: Why don't you hop out of my arms?
"Murph: Yeah, okay. I'm gonna jump down into Sofia's way."
Brennan: Can you do an Athletics check?
Murph: Oh god.
[Siobhan chuckles]
Emily: But won't I? I'm catching him. I'm pretty athletic.
Murph: Can I do Acrobatic?
"Brennan: You can do Acrobatics, yeah."
"Murph: Good, okay."
"Emily: And I'm acrobatic too, I have the feat."
Murph: I do a handspring.
[Emily imitates air whooshing]
"Kugrash: Spot me, Sof."
Ally: Spot me.
Kugrash: Oh fuck. Fuck my life.
Murph: I pulled my back. I got a 6 or a 7.
"Brennan: Um, great. Give me, you can use—"
Emily: I have a reaction.
Brennan: You can use your reaction to try to catch him.
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Acrobatics check.
Emily: Okay. [groans] I got 13.
"Brennan: Kug, you take 5 points of damage as you fucking faceplant onto the roof."
Kugrash: Absolutely.
Ally: I pulled my back.
Emily: What is with my rolls today?
Kugrash: I deserve this.
Siobhan: Little pieces of toilet stuck into your skin.
Kugrash: I deserved it.
Brennan: [chuckles] You have little toilet shards in your fur.
"Ally: Oh, we're fucked."
Brennan: That's Kug.
Ally: Can you shoot a fire demon? Like with a gun?
"Siobhan: I mean, maybe. But who fucking knows if it'll work."
"Brennan: Okay, that's gonna be a bunch of demons starting their turn."
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Sofia: All right, these are new dice."
Zac: They create fire as they move so we have to like...
Lou: We just have to kill them.
Emily: Yeah.
"Zac: Kill them, yeah."
Murph: Every turn like 10 fire things go up and I had a water tower by a one.
"Brennan: Go ahead and roll damage and it's a Wisdom saving throw, right?"
Lou: Wisdom saving throw.
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: Do I just roll once for both?
"Brennan: Roll once for both of them, yeah."
"Lou: Great, it's 16."
"Brennan: 16, eh?"
Lou: And halved movement.
Brennan: Oh and if they fail their movement’s halved?
"Lou: I think in general, an affected creature's speed is halved in the area."
"Ally: Great, that's great."
"Brennan: Ah, hell yeah. Yeah, you see that your Spirit Guardians wham, wham [thumping] just wailing on these fucking--"
Kingston: Get 'em boy.!
[Brennan and Emily laugh]
"Brennan: Dope as hell as New Yorkers just beating the shit. Someone's got like a thick wooden bat, crowbar, [thumping] just wailing on these guys."
"Spiritual New Yorkers: Got your back, Kingston. These fucking people, huh?"
Brennan: But they are still going to go.
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: This guy's gonna swing for Misty, this guy's now got full attention from Kingston, those are misses. Wow. That one misses Kingston every single time. So it's gonna go for Misty. It's gonna be two hits and then..."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: Last one's gonna be[whispering] 6 plus 8. [normal] Okay. One's coming for Misty again. So Misty, you're gonna go ahead and take..."
Siobhan: Fuck.
Ally: What are you at?
"Siobhan: 34, well we'll see."
"Ally: Oh wait, can I do Bend Luck on one of those, and subtract a D4?"
Brennan: Go ahead. There's two attacks and there's a third attack. Which one are you doing?
Ally: Of the three?
"Brennan: Of the three. One, two, or three."
Ally: Do I have to pick which one to subtract a D4 from?
Brennan: Yep.
[dramatic music]
Ally: Third attack. Go ahead and roll. [sadly] Subtract 1.
Brennan: 1 is exactly as much as you needed to subtract.
Ally: No way.
[group cheers]
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: That guy rolled something. He got exactly Misty's AC. However, Misty you still take 17 points of damage."
Siobhan: Fuck.
Emily: Jesus Christ.
Brennan: That [imitates fighting noises] and then these guys are coming after. One of these guys is coming for Ricky.
"Zac: I'm at 22 AC, right now."
Brennan: Jesus. One of those is a hit.
Ally: How?
"Brennan: That's a miss. Ricky, you take 7 points of slashing damage."
Zac: Is that it?
"Brennan: That's it. Yeah, that AC got way the fuck up there."
Emily: You're next turn are you gonna get to use four attacks?
Zac: Well...
"Brennan: And then, the sort of dragon-headed devil is gonna go for Pete."
"Zac: Yes, but I'm trying to decide if I can..."
Ally: Where's that at?
"Brennan: I am gonna need, by the way, for people that have been hit, I'm gonna need some Concentration checks."
"Zac: Oh yeah, I got hit, so that was 7 points."
"Brennan: 7 points, that was just a DC10."
Zac: What do I add to it?
Brennan: Constitution saving throw.
"Zac: Fuck, I only got a 9."
"Brennan: Okay, your Shield of Faith on Pete disappears. Yeah, that vanishes. And then I'm gonna need one from, Kingston didn't get hit. Misty, you got hit."
Siobhan: I don't have any concentration spells left.
"Brennan: That's right, the Fear is gone. So that's going to be..."
Murph: I realize the spiders didn't go 'cause I rolled really high. I got like an 18 on them.
"Brennan: Yes, but that actually puts them before your turn."
"Murph: Oh, got it. I had a 19."
"Brennan: Oh wait, you got a 19?"
Murph: Mm hm.
"Brennan: Oh, I'm fucking crazy. The bugs should go then. The bugs go after you. I'm actually gonna just put the bugs on your turn."
"Zac: I don't add my Charisma with Aura of Devotion to my other saving throws, right?"
"Brennan: Uh, you just add. It's just protection. So you would get the plus 3 there."
"Zac: Oh, of my Charisma?"
Brennan: Of your Charisma.
"Zac: Then yeah, I pass."
"Brennan: Oh, then you still have Shield of Faith."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Brennan: There you go.
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: Ba-da-boom. That's going to be, we'll have your bugs go in a second. Dragon lady's going after Pete. That's two hits."
Zac: How close is Pete to me? Am I getting an attack of opportunity?
"Brennan: Oh yeah, you're there."
Emily: Yeah. Sentinel!
"Brennan: Yeah, you absolutely gonna get an attack of opportunity if you want."
"Zac: Ooh, yeah, 27."
Murph: Nice.
"Lou: Ooh, yeah, baby!"
"Zac: So one d8 plus seven. Okay, so 8 but then they’re also, they can't move."
"Brennan: Oh wow, awesome."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: You did 8 points of damage?
Zac: Yes.
Brennan: Dope. That's going to be...
Siobhan: Did any of them move?
Emily: Who needs a Shield of Faith when you have a Sentinel?
[Zac chuckles]
"Brennan: Pete, you take 16 points of damage."
Siobhan: These guys already fucked us up so much and we have not hurt any of them. And I don't know how to stop them.
"Brennan: That's going to be, that's them. Going to roll for some fire."
[dramatic bass music]
[fire whooshes]
Lou: Holy man.
Zac: I think I have to go put a fire.
"Murph: No, I mean, like what can we do?"
"Zac: Can we get out? I mean, like, people need to be able to get out."
"Lou: Hey, Ricky, you have Haste now so you're about to go again."
"Zac: Yeah, but I was only in my turn."
"Lou: Oh, okay. So that was the devils."
Brennan: More fire starts to spread. Let's have those bugs go.
"Murph: Okay. Can I try, I wanna yell to Ricky for his fire expertise, hoping he hears out the window [chuckles]."
Brennan: Mm hmm.
"Kugrash: Hey, Ricky, is there any way for people to get out down there or should I have my spiders make a web up here and have people run to the roof?"
"Ricky: Make a freaking web, dude."
"Murph: All right, cool. I'm gonna have the spiders... I'm gonna yell for Ricky."
"Kugrash: Ricky, people like you more, maybe you yell and tell people that plan."
Murph: And then I want to have the spiders go over and create like webs down so people can jump down.
"Emily: Ooh, I love this!"
[cheers]
"Brennan: So down here, like a little like trampoline?"
"Murph: Yeah, I want to make like a bad flight landing."
"Brennan: Gotcha. Cool, cool, cool."
Murph: So people can jump.
Brennan: Rad.
Emily: And then we can start entering all these folk.
Murph: And then we stop worrying about the fire.
[chuckles]
Emily: Yeah.
Siobhan: These guys are being very chill considering they're standing next to three giant spiders.
Murph: Yeah.
Emily: I know.
"Brennan: He sees this,"
"Spider: Er, Kugrash, a trampoline of webbing. Delightfully creative. Myself and my compatriots begin work at once. Come take the strands from my butt and weave them."
[everyone guffaws]
Brennan: And they dip over the side.
"Sofia: Kug, Make sure they don't get too fancy with the webbing."
"Kugrash: Yeah, don't get, just straight up, a regular--"
Sofia: A real practical...
Spider: Jacob's Ladder from the cat's cradle should do the trick.
[laughter]
Ally: Oh can you throw like that mattress down and have it cover the barbed wire?
[Murph laughs]
"Emily: Oh, or even just like the couch?"
Ally: The couch cushions.
Murph: I think I've done enough for these people. I need to kill some devils now.
Brennan: Dope.
"Ally: Oh, I should roll for Concentration. I had a Concentration thing."
"Brennan: But I don't think, yes, you have to roll for concentration, that's correct."
"Emily: Haste. Oh no, where's the four?"
Ally: 18.
Brennan: Fuck yeah.
Lou: Great for you.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: I'm glad.
Siobhan: Still buff.
Zac: I'm always buff.
"Brennan: Ricky and Ox, that's you baby. You also hear screams of people down there on the lower level."
[people screaming]
"Zac: Ugh, I'm going to speak to my axe, real fast."
"Brennan: You see, your axe says,"
"Axe: Sire, the time has come for action."
[slow inspirational music]
"Axe: You are a hero. Champion of New York City, accrued a questing blade from Rome to London, Moscow to Beijing, heroes of the Chosen Cities advance at the call. Will you now deny your place?"
Ricky: I was looking for more practical advice but I will...
"Axe: What does your heart tell you, hero?"
Ricky: I'm scared I'm not going to get all these people out of here.
"Axe: Fear, fear is necessary for acts of bravery. Do what you must. Worry not about your chances of success."
"Zac: All right, I am just going to take attacks at this devil in front of me, I guess."
"Brennan: Hell, yeah. Go for it."
Emily: You could do like four attacks at him.
"Zac: So, I think I only get three attacks 'cause it's like you only get to use one attack."
"Brennan: One extra weapon attack, yeah."
Zac: Oh fuck.
Ally: Did you get a d8?
Zac: Can I use Bardic for this?
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: You can use Bardic.
"Zac: Okay, 15. Does that hit?"
Brennan: 15 does not hit.
Emily: Fuck.
Zac: Neither of those attacks hit.
[Emily screams]
Zac: Then my last. I'll use my haste attack. That'll hit. Or 23.
Emily: Thank you.
"Brennan: 23? Okay, cool. Awesome. Yeah, 23 definitely hits."
"Zac: Oh, good. That's 15 damage and then I'm gonna Divine Smite him as well."
[Emily gasps]
"Brennan: Oh shit, cool."
Zac: How fucked up does he look?
Brennan: Not too fucked up.
Zac: Second level Divine Smite him.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Do fiends take an extra d8 or is that just undead?
Brennan: From Divine Smite? Oh.
Zac: I am not sure actually.
"Brennan: Oh let me actually, that's worth checking."
"Murph: I think it, yeah, 'cause that would be fucking helpful for this fight."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Damage will increase by one d8 if the target is an undead or fiend.
Murph: There you go.
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: Woo!
"Brennan: So if you're burning a second level, you're gonna add 3d8 to that."
Ally: Yeah.
"Zac: All right. So come on please. Okay, we're talking 14 damage,"
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: On top of the 15.
[Emily screams]
"Brennan: With that, so you like miss him twice and he goes,"
"Art Devil: Ooh, tasteless, style-less, so last year darling."
"Brennan: And then you, [roars and knife slashing] as your axe connects and he goes from looking pretty okay to fucked up."
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: Then Ox is gonna attack them as well.
[Emily cheers]
Brennan: Go for it.
Zac: And Ox gets advantage.
Siobhan: Good boy Ox.
"Emily: Good puppy, good puppy."
"Zac: Okay, 17 plus 4, yeah, 21."
"Brennan: Oh, 17? Wait, Ox does 21 damage?"
"Zac: No, that's his hit?"
"Brennan: 21 hits. I was like Jesus, this fucking dalmatian is out of control."
Murph: Did you take three attacks or four?
Zac: I took three.
"Murph: 'Cause you get two actions, right?"
Zac: But.
Brennan: The second action only—
Murph: Got it.
Zac: It's only one atack.
Brennan: It's only one weapon attack.
Siobhan: Does Ox also get haste because Ox is part of...
"Zac: Ooh, do I get the same spell?"
"Brennan: Actually, I think the language of Find Steed is that any spell that affects you, affects your steed, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: So Ox has an extra weapon attack as well.
Murph: That’s fucking awesome.
"Zac: Okay, I'll roll that. Is 14 gonna hit? No, okay."
"Brennan: No, 14's not gonna hit."
"Zac: All right, cool."
Brennan: But the first attack does hit.
"Zac: 2, 5, plus 4, so he does 9. And then it's a DC 11 strength saving throw."
"Brennan: Aw, hell yes. Ox leaps up and drags this fucking demon to the ground."
[Emily cheers]
[imitates dog growling]
Siobhan: So fucking metal.
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: He's the buffest dalmatian.
"Brennan: In the future, by the way, the prone thing is important. Ox should actually go first because if Ox had dragged him prone—"
Zac: Oh yeah.
Brennan: You woulda gotten an advantage on every single attack.
[Emily groans]
"Brennan: No worries. But you see that you and Ox are both filled with this illuminated sparkling dream magic as Pete is just funneling. And for the first time, Pete, you feel your magic. You're like, oh I've got this! I fucking know exactly what I'm here to do."
[whoosh]
Zac: Can I make a minor action? Or just to see what the quality of the building is at the moment?
Brennan: The fire's spread and now the room is filling with smoke. It's gonna start being these levels of exhaustion for people. Even if they're not standing in direct flame. Now that the room is filled with smoke.
Zac: Gotcha.
"Brennan: Kingston, that's you."
"Lou: Uh, great. Can I cast Spare the Dying on that young man or young woman who was struck down at the beginning of the fight by that demon?"
"Brennan: Uh, yes, you can."
"Lou: Great. I do that, then I turn around and cast a second level Healing Word on Misty."
[spiritual music]
[Emily cheers]
"Siobhan: Thank you, my son."
Lou: Of course.
[Emily laughs]
"Lou: And that's for 9, sorry I can't do more."
Siobhan: That's great.
[Emily mumbles]
Lou: And then can I shout to everyone?
Kingston: Everyone we're going off the roof. There's some kind of device being established there.
Kugrash: It's a web. It's a gross web.
"Kingston: I'm gonna leave that part out, Kug."
[Brennan laughs loudly]
[Emily laughs]
"Kingston: There's a device that'll get us safely out of the building. To the roof, post haste."
Kugrash: The spider said it was doing out of his ass.
"Kingston: [chuckles] Okay, Kug."
Kugrash: It's coming out. It's big.
Kingston: [laughs] Okay. It's safe.
"Sofia: Not too mention, it's real sticky and it's picking up all the litter blowing by."
Kugrash: Yeah.
Kingston: Okay.
Kugrash: There is a Solo cups in there
"Brennan: All of Kingston's Spirit Guardians start going,"
"Spiritual New Yorkers: Listen to the man, it’s the fucking Vox Populi. Come on!"
"Brennan: And everyone heeds. Go ahead and make a Perception, or Persuasion with advantage."
Lou: Great. That's gonna be Persuasion. It's 21.
"Brennan: Fuck yeah. Everyone's like got it. They just listen to your authority and begin to turn around and head for the roof. Peter, that's gonna be you."
"Ally: Okay, I pick up Priya. Can I see if there's anything I can do to like help her? Or she's just fully down?"
Brennan: She is unconscious and making death saving throws.
Ally: Can I help her?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can make a Medicine check."
Ally: Cool.
Siobhan: Don't you have Cure Wounds?
Ally: No. My medicine check is 7.
"Brennan: Cool, you jam some fingers into, like CPR, but you're also like holding her. It does not work."
"Ally: I don't touch her mouth. Okay, great. Then, man, fuck you Infierno."
Zac: Get out of here.
Ally: I look at her and the demon next to her and I cast Fear.
"Brennan: Dope as hell. That's gonna be, is that Wisdom from both of them? Can you double check that for me?"
"Ally: Actually, hold on, sorry. Fuck. Everything is a concentration spell. Everything I have. So then you would lose haste."
Emily: Aw.
[Zac groans]
"Ally: Is it really helping? 'Cause it's not giving you an extra attack, right?"
"Emily: Yeah, it is, it's giving him one extra attack."
"Ally: Oh, it gave you one extra attack?"
Zac: I just missed two attacks.
"Ally: Oh yeah, I thought he was supposed to give you four and he only gave you three. Um, okay."
[Lou laughs]
Emily: I think he's good.
Zac: It's gonna be helpful when I can move around. After I get rid of it and join everybody.
"Brennan: You also do have, there are other spells, like you have Banishment, you have..."
Ally: Which is concentration.
Brennan: Oh it is?
Ally: Everything I have is concentration except Sleep. So I'm gonna cast Sleep.
[Emily laughs loudly]
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Infierno and that demon next to her.
Emily: That'd be so awesome. I'd love to attack her while she's sleeping.
Brennan: What level spell slot are you gonna burn?
"Ally: Oh, four. Wait, three."
"Brennan: You burn three, cool."
Murph: It's an extra 2d8 for each level above first.
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: So that's what you're gonna be, so you're gonna roll 9d8. Let's go ahead."
[Emily cheering]
Ally: Thank you.
Murph: She has so much HP. But maybe you'll knock out the other guy.
Ally: Yeah.
"Emily: Yeah, you may knock out the other guy."
Ally: All right.
"Emily: Here, I've got one for you."
"Ally: I need 4d8, right?"
Brennan: Mm hmm.
"Ally: Nice, okay."
Lou: Do you need more?
"Ally: I got it, thanks. [rolls] Yeah. Okay, cool."
"Murph: Oh, that's good."
"Ally: 10, that's another 10."
"Siobhan: [to the tune of “Shots”] Math, math, math, math, math, math."
Brennan: That's 34.
"Ally: So that's 34, 36, 41."
Brennan: 41 points. You actually need one more d8 in there.
Murph: Ah yeah you only have… [grabs a d8] There.
"Ally: Oh nice. So, 7."
"Brennan: So that went from 48 to, is that 55?"
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: Oh yeah. Our boy here who's just knocked prone goes,"
"Art Devil: Ha, this dog is such a..."
[whistling woosh]
"Brennan: Sand rips out of your hand and he is fully asleep. This is the most injured demon you've been working on Ricky, falls asleep."
Ally: And he's the only one? An untouched—
Brennan: No one else gets touched.
Ally: Which one of these are yours? These two?
"Brennan: But our boy, the unicorn-horned demon, is slumbering. So that's your extra, are you gonna move at all or no?"
Zac: Can you carry Priya up to the roof?
"Ally: Yeah, I'll start carrying Priya up to the roof."
Brennan: Dope. You rush through here. You carry Priya. You probably can't make it through all these people. Give me an Athletics check to like jump over and make your way through but there will be some.
"Ally: Okay, yeah. Athletics, 14."
"Brennan: Cool. You leap and run through this crowd as people over here. Tell me how far, you're just trying to get as far as you can?"
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool. One, two, three. I'm gonna say you can get all the way to about here."
"Ally: Okay, cool."
Brennan: 'Cause all like crazy difficult terrain. As you're carrying Priya. But they are gonna get some attacks of opportunity on you as you do that.
"Ally: Cool. The one, the one right there?"
Brennan: That one dragon lady's gonna get an attack of opportunity on you and nails you for—
"Ally: Oh, I cast Shield again."
Brennan: Okay. Still actually hit.
Ally: Okay. With the DC...?
Brennan: With an AC of 20.
"Ally: 20, yeah."
Zac: You still have Shield of Faith?
"Brennan: Yeah, it still hits."
[Murph groans]
Brennan: That's going to be 8 damage to Pete.
Ally: Cool.
Brennan: And I'm gonna need a concentration check. I'm gonna need the Constitution saving throw.
"Ally: Aw, yeah, no worry. 17, plus, yah, yah."
Brennan: Hell yes. Your Haste is still there. You rush through.
[imitates footsteps stomping]
Brennan: That's going to now be these.
Ally: I'm at 15.
Lou: 15?
Brennan: Bystanders. These guys rush over here. [screams] And they leap. Yeah. Let's roll for their leap.
Murph: Oh no.
Brennan: Successful.
All: Yay.
[cheers and clapping]
Brennan: They land over here in the alley with the horrifying bugs.
[Ally and Siobhan laugh]
"Kugrash: Good job, you weird fucking pretentious spider."
[Siobhan chuckles]
Spider: The bounciness of the web is a secret that I shall never tell!
Misty: We don't need to know it.
Pete: It's butt related. We all know it's butt related.
"Sofia: Yeah, I feel like it's not a secret if no one wants to know."
Misty: Yeah.
"Brennan: These guys come charging up the stairs over here. There you go. These guys can't move past the demons. They are like trapped over here screaming. These guys rush through the flame and are like trapped in between,"
Lou: No.
Brennan: Flames over here.
"Lou: Oh, come on."
[chuckles]
Brennan: These guys are like rushing over this way to get away from the steps.
Ally: What's that big guy? Is that an art piece or is that a person?
Brennan: Make a little like… You were on the steps.
Ally: 12\.
"Brennan: Give me actually, put that into Arcana."
Ally: Okay.
Emily: Yeah.
"Ally: Yeah, uh, 16."
Brennan: 16\. You look down as you're fleeing the staircase. There's something magical about that statue down there.
[mysterious music]
Ally: Okay cool.
Siobhan: Is it Willy?
Lou: It's not Willy.
Brennan: Ah.
Lou: It is Willy?
Brennan: That's Willy.
"Lou: Absolutely, okay, great."
Misty: East Williamsburg. Real deep east.
"Brennan: So you flee, rush over there. I don't think there's anymore. Yeah, these guys are like trapped over here as well. As the fire spreads, that's going to go back and be Sofia."
"Emily: Okay, I want to down one of these floaters. One of these red Solo cup floaters."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: And then I'm gonna take my movement to get, I'm assuming that since I'm such a wily little New Yorker monk, I can just squeeze through everyone."
Brennan: You've trained with Jackson in this exact talent.
"Emily: Yeah. And then I'm gonna use Step of the Wind and that basically gives me my movement to get here. But I'd like to for flavor, say that I jump. 'Cause it also doubles my jump."
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Emily: So I'd like to from the top of the stairs, just deny the stairs the pleasure of my feet and just jump on top of Isabella Infierno."
[Brennan chuckles]
Lou: Do you have battle jump or anything like that?
Emily: Nah.
Brennan: You—
"Murph: Oh, is she down there?"
"Brennan: She's down there. You leap past Kingston in the midst of his Spiritual Guardians, no sweat."
"Emily: Okay, and then I'm just gonna attack her."
"Brennan: Cool, great."
Emily: Because I used Step of the Wind. Does a 16 or 17 hit?
Brennan: Neither a 16 nor 17 hit.
"Emily: All right. Go again. That doesn't hit. All right, well, I showed up."
"Brennan: [laughs] [imitates punching] Yeah, you swing wildly for Isabella. That's going to be Isabella's turn."
Lou: Wisdom saving throw please.
Brennan: Yes. Go ahead and roll damage.
"Lou: Uh, 6, 7, 8."
Murph: That's amazing.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Lou: That's 22, 23. Why can't I..."
Siobhan: 21?
"Lou: 21, is that what it is?"
Brennan: 21?
"Lou: No, it's not."
Siobhan: 15 plus 13?
Lou: It's 22.
Zac: 21.
"Brennan: 21, it's 21. Six, seven and eight is the same as three sevens, right?"
Lou: Math is not my thing.
"Brennan: You see that, yeah, your New Yorkers surround Isabella..."
[imitates fighting]
Brennan: Raining blows.
[imitates hitting]
"Brennan: She looks, you guys, are dealing damage to her. She is going to focus just on Sofia."
Sofia: Bring it on.
Emily: I'm gonna real quick Shield and my armor class is 24.
Brennan: [laughs] Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: Good luck, bitch."
Emily: I kind of want to get fucked up.
"Ally: No, but if she misses."
Emily: Then I can.
Ally: That demon is right next to her.
Murph: Everybody is going to get fucked up in this fight. We haven't done anything yet.
Ally: Yah.
Murph: I wouldn't take damage on purpose.
"Brennan: On her first hit, she deals you."
Emily: She gets past 24 AC?
Brennan: She does.
Emily: Fuck me.
Brennan: She deals you 23 points of damage.
Siobhan: How you doing?
Emily: I'm fine. I want to get down anyways.
"Brennan: She hits you again for another 13. I'm going to need from you, a Constitution saving throw."
Emily: Okay. 15
[dramatic music]
"Zac: Are you with the, nevermind."
Brennan: You are...
Zac: How close are you to me?
Brennan: Is the range 10 or 30?
Zac: It's just 10.
"Brennan: 10, you are not within..."
"Emily: Okay, I have 15."
Brennan: You feel her rupture something inside of you. With some ki powered attack.
Sofia: She's a fucking monk too? You bitch. Probably more powerful than me.
Brennan: That is Isabella's.
"Misty: Don't even say it. Don't you fucking say it, you're more powerful than her."
"Ally: Can I, I know it's not my turn, can I roll insight to see which plane Isabella is from? And if it's Earth."
"Brennan: Oh, she's from hell."
[Murph chuckles]
Brennan: She's fully from hell.
Ally: Great.
Brennan: Isabella takes those attacks and then disappears.
[chimes ringing]
Emily: No! Fuck me.
"Brennan: Vanishes and Kug, you see her appear here on the roof."
"Kugrash: She's up here, Sof."
Sofia: [calls up] Fuck me.
[Lou laughs]
"Brennan: That's Isabella's turn. Misty, at the beginning, wait, you healed Misty."
"Siobhan: I got healed, yeah."
Brennan: You do not take any more damage from that wound.
"Siobhan: Okay, great."
"Zac: Oh yeah, if you get healed at all, it stops the rupture, right?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, it stops the rupture. But, Misty, it's gonna be your turn."
"Siobhan: Great, I would like to cast, can I cast Hypnotic Pattern in like, oh fuck, Isabella moved. Where'd she go?"
Ally: On the roof.
"Siobhan: The bitch is on the roof? God, I hate her."
Lou: Bitch is on the roof.
Emily: Feel free to Dimension Door is up there now.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna grab."
Murph: Nice.
Ally: Can you grab me and...?
"Siobhan: No, I can only grab one person, I'm sorry. Um, I'm gonna grab Sofia by the arm."
[Emily claps]
Emily: Yeah.
Misty: And we're gonna get this bitch together.
"Sofia: Yeah, can't mess this up."
"Siobhan: We dimension door up to here and I'm gonna attack her with my rapier. Can I do that? It's an action to do Dimension Door, so probably not, right?"
"Brennan: It's an action, yeah, you can't do that."
"Siobhan: Fuck. In which case,"
[whoosh]
"Siobhan: We get up there and I also say,"
"Misty: And Sofia, you look 20 years younger than her. 50 years younger."
[Zac laughs loudly]
Sofia: Oh my god.
Siobhan: And I give her Bardic inspiration again.
Isabella: What the fuck?
Misty: You old bitch.
Isabella: That's not true.
Misty: You old bitch.
Isabella: I made my body from hell magic.
Misty: Old bitch.
"Isabella: Fuck you, I'm an old bitch? You're the fuckin’ old bitch, you old ass bitch."
"Misty: Come at me, you bitch."
[Emily laughs]
"Isabella: Dusty ass Broadway bullshit, fuck you."
"Misty: I lived in New York for hundreds of fucking years, you think you can fucking come for me?"
"Isabella: Oh, bite my fucking ass."
Misty: Fuck you.
"Emily: This is making Sofia tear up, oh my god."
Misty: You come for my friend?
Sofia: Misty's really going to bat for me. Oh my god.
"Brennan: Incredible. So action, you Dimension Door. You do anything else that turn or no?"
"Siobhan: Uh, I mean, that's kind of all I can do. I think I will like, if I take a movement back from her, will she get an opportunity attack?"
"Brennan: No, you could, no, you could Dimension Door so that you're not standing right next to her."
"Siobhan: Right, great, yeah, I would love to do that."
"Brennan: Cool. And then, do you have bonus action or anything, or no?"
"Siobhan: I mean, I bonus actioned..."
"Brennan: Yes, give the Bardic inspiration, cool."
Siobhan: The Bardic Inspiration and I can't do two spells.
Emily: Should we worry? Should we put Misty somewhere that's not one thing away from fire?
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, you put her over by the toilet. Put it there."
"Siobhan: Yeah, stick me in the toilet."
[everyone chuckles]
"Brennan: Great, that's going to be Kugrash and his bugs."
Murph: All right.
Lou: Kugrash and his bugs.
"Murph: Let's see, so I'm guessing that the spider webs are not going to be able to save everyone unless I have the spiders like continually work on the web, right?"
Brennan: Correct.
"Murph: I can't have them just ditch it, cool."
"Kugrash: Spiders, keep doing your thing out of your ass."
"Spider: Ooh! [a little too interested] Long have I awaited that command, my King."
Zac: Can you summon more rats?
Murph: I can. How are you looking?
Emily: I'm fine.
Murph: You're fine.
Zac: She's ruptured.
"Emily: I mean, I'm gonna rupture, something’s gonna rupture inside of me but I don't mind getting low 'cause it makes me do more damage."
Murph: I think me summoning rats right now isn't a great idea because people are bamfing all over the place and my rats are just gonna die in the fire.
Lou: What are they doing? Bamfing?
"Emily: Like going, like Misty Stepping."
Murph: So I am going to… Do you have enough HP though that Cure Wounds would actually help you?
"Emily: I've got a 21, but I need to be at half HP to get an extra radiant damage."
"Murph: Okay, so I'll leave you not healed. How are you?"
Emily: Unless you want to or something.
"Siobhan: I'm fine, bring the rats."
"Murph: Okay, yeah, okay, then I will use my crown to summon rats."
Brennan: Where do you summon them?
Murph: Where do I summon them? I guess around Infierno here.
Emily: Will you make sure to tell the rats my intimate backstory with Isabella Infierno?
[royal rat music]
"Kugrash: So basically, Sofie was with Dale, thought that he left her, did it, this lady, not a nice lady. Killed Dale."
Misty: Not nice at all.
Sofia: Yeah.
Rats: The king has proclaimed this homewrecker a traitor!
Kugrash: And then I'm going to summon the spiciest pigeon. [arms up in the air]
[Brennan laughs]
Emily: Whoa.
Kugrash: That I can think of.
Siobhan: Perry!
Murph: My spirit totem of the hawk which lets me use my reaction to give people advantage on attacks.
[cheers]
Murph: I'm gonna let you hit this lady.
"Sofia: Thank you, God."
"Murph: So, yeah."
"Sofia: Or rather, thank you, Nod."
Brennan: All these fucking gross creatures appear. There's bugs working down here. There's a fucking pigeon. There's rats.
[cooing noises]
"Perry the Pigeon: Hi, Kugrash."
"Kingston: Hey, Perry, good to see you, bud."
Ally: Perry's just body-rolling.
"Perry the Pigeon: God, you look great. You really look great. The crown suits you."
"Kugrash: You look good too, man."
Brennan: [chuckles] Go ahead and roll attacks for your...
Zac: It's like a Dreamworks movie.
Murph: My rats.
"Brennan: For your rats, do they all have advantage too?"
Murph: They don't. I can use a reaction to give one person advantage.
"Brennan: Gotcha, cool, cool, cool. Gotcha."
"Murph: Cool, so do three."
Ally: Do you need another 20?
"Murph: I think these guys only have plus… Okay, one guy got 16. The other guys, I'm gonna guess probably didn't hit."
Brennan: 16 does not hit.
"Murph: God dammit. Okay, none of them hit. Shouldn't have sent these rats."
Rats: [squeals] She's very good at fighting. We find that this is hard.
[Emily guffaws]
Kugrash: I get it.
Brennan: Incredible.
"Emily: Is she impossible to be hit? No, 'cause your Spirit Guardians, right? Yeah."
Siobhan: Yah
Murph: I'm also gonna use some movement. I don't like that we're all so close to each other. I'm gonna get over by this couch if that's cool.
"Sofia: Ooh, Kug, kick your feet up, huh?"
"Kugrash: Yeah, I take it."
Kingston: Kug's taking this flight off.
Kugrash: I take a quick nap.
"Ally: Oh, has this water tower been putting out more flames up here?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and take this one and this one away up here."
[water running]
"Brennan: As the water tower continues, I'm gonna take this one away."
"Kugrash: I did something, Ricky."
[Emily laughs]
Ricky: Awesome.
Brennan: That's going to be these devils here.
"Zac: He can't move, right?"
Lou: Wisdom.
Brennan: He can't move but you just say that this guy here.
Lou: Makes a Wisdom saving throw. They take either a four damage or two damage depending on if they succeeded.
"Murph: Ooh, good one."
[chuckles]
Lou: Ba-ba-bum.
Ally: Remember that one that was 21. Remember that?
Lou: Remember that 21?
Ally: That was cool. That was cool.
Brennan: Some low rolls today.
Murph: Spirit Guardians just flicking their ears.
Lou: Ow.
[Emily laughs loudly]
Murph: Stop.
Brennan: This guy rushes over here. And then Peggy actually leaps.
Zac: I thought she couldn't move?
"Brennan: Oh, 'cause you hit her with a Sentinel? But it's a new turn for her."
Zac: Is this? Okay.
Brennan: This is new on her turn. So your Sentinel prevented her from moving on the last turn but she wasn't trying to move on her last turn when she was attacking.
"Zac: Oh, okay."
Brennan: Now it's her new turn and she's trying to attack but she goes over and uses her whole action just to wake up this guy over here.
Zac: Do I get to attack her 'cause she moved next to me?
"Brennan: Is that how a Sentinel works? Gives something? No, she never leaves your threatened area is the only thing. So she doesn't trigger an attack of opportunity. And then he's going to actually take some swings at Ox."
"Zac: Oh but when he attacks Ox, I get to attack."
"Brennan: Oh yes, that is correct."
"Murph: Oh, dope."
"Brennan: Yes, yes, yes."
"Zac: Cool. 20, not nat."
Brennan: 20 hits.
Zac: I hit him for 12.
Brennan: Hell yeah. [imitates a punching noise] He's looking fucked up. He's going to turn to attack Ox. What's Ox's AC?
Zac: 13.
"Brennan: 13, huh?"
Ally: With Haste?
"Zac: Oh, 15."
Ally: Plus 2.
"Brennan: Ooh, okay. This guy attacks Ox. He first deals Ox 9 points of damage."
"Zac: Okay. He only has 11 health, so."
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Brennan: He stands up, says,"
Art Devil: This your dog? Dalmatian?
"Ricky: Yeah, why?"
Art Devil: So pedestrian. You're sort of a basic bitch aren't you?
Ricky: How is that pedestrian?
Brennan: [imitates whooshing] He incinerates Ox.
Ricky: Ah.
[Emily gasps]
Siobhan: I go into a rage.
[whoosh]
"Brennan: Ox looks to you and says,"
"Ox: I'm sorry, Ricky. Don't worry, I can't ever die."
"Brennan looks directly into the camera on “I can’t ever die”, and addresses his next words to the camera as well:"
Brennan: The dog's fine. And [suctioning sound] disbands into light.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: And that's going to be, that's those guys going there and then these guys are gonna take some swings on Kingston. Kingston, your armor class is 18."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: You take 25 points of damage from them slashing at you. And then, take another two attack. And each come at you with this fire, [imitates fire whooshing] that swirls around you and does not touch you."
[fire crackling]
"Lou: Yeah, yeah that feels right."
[fire whooshing]
"Brennan: As it roars everywhere around you, that's going to and then that's the devils..."
[whoosh]
Lou: Yikes.
[whoosh]
Brennan: These guys are partially surrounded by flame.
[imitates fire crackling]
"Emily: Hey, do you know if Willy is cool with fire?"
[laughs]
Lou: I mean and this is all up.
Zac: Can you scream to Willy?
Lou: I can't Scry.
Zac: But can you yell?
Lou: My plan is to just go get his attention.
Murph: Something's got to be wrong with Willy if he's standing there.
Lou: I mean that's the problem.
Emily: Oh my god. I wonder if they're like using his energy somehow?
"Brennan: That's going to be, Ricky, that's going to be you."
Zac: I see that he just destroyed my beautiful light Dalmatian.
[Emily laughs]
Zac: And I'm just going to attack.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Well, if I Turn the Unholy, they'll just be running around spreading fire everywhere, right?"
[Murph laughs]
"Zac: Okay, I'm just going to attack."
Murph: You can also use Divine Smite multiple times in a turn.
"Zac: Okay, yeah, I might do that."
"Ally: Yeah, 'cause then you have three Divine Smites."
Murph: We gotta kill some dudes.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
"Zac: Okay, does a 17 hit?"
Brennan: 17 does not hit.
Lou: Fuck.
Zac: Does a 15 hit?
Brennan: 15 does not hit.
"Zac: Yes, 15 plus eight so 23."
"Brennan: That definitely hits, yes."
"Zac: Okay, so I'll do on that one, then I'll just roll my third attack. Okay, 20."
Brennan: 20 hits.
"Zac: Okay, so I'm going to do a second level Divine Smite."
Brennan: So you're doing a second level?
"Zac: I'll do a first, should I just see my damage and then can I do it?"
Brennan: I think before you roll damage you should do it. You know whether you've hit so you should announce what level spell you're using to smite now.
"Zac: Since I've hit twice, I'll do just a first level on the first attack."
"Brennan: Cool and that first level's going to be 3d8. So you're going to roll 4d8, plus your modifier."
Zac: So that's 14.
Emily: Ooh.
"Zac: 19 plus 7, 26 on the first attack"
[Emily cheers]
Zac: On the guy who's very hurt.
"Brennan: Ooh, he's looking extremely bad."
Zac: Ah fuck!
"Emily: Jesus, they are so fucking strong!"
Lou: He's looking extremely hurt with more than 26 life right now?
"Zac: All right, then I'm just going to regular attack him just to hopefully save my divine smites for the next guy. And that would be 1d8 plus 7. 8?"
"Brennan: He looks at you and goes,"
"Art Devil: Oh so, what it's a problem to come here and heat things up a little bit? What's wrong with a little fire?"
Ricky: Everything.
Brennan: [grunting loudly] Boom! Bury the axe in his head and in a burst of flame he vanishes.
[imitates explosion]
"Siobhan: Well, we killed one of them."
"Emily: Wow, it only took us [laughs] many rounds."
Ally: Fuck.
Brennan: That's Ricky. Are you taking a movement or any bonus action stuff that turn?
Zac: Um.
"Brennan: You used all three attacks, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Kingston, that's gonna be you."
"Lou: Great. How bad are you, Pete?"
Ally: 15.
Lou: 15.
Zac: Is there like any area heals that you have?
"Lou: Yeah, I have Mass Healing word."
Zac: 'Cause that maybe will bring Priya up.
Lou: Yeah.
Siobhan: I think that'd be great.
Zac: And that guy that was hurt next to her.
"Lou: That feels good. Yeah, I'll cast Mass Healing word."
[spiritual music]
"Ally: [whispers] Yes, thank you."
Lou: So everyone is going to get [sighs] 9 HP.
Ally: Great.
Emily: Ooh.
Brennan: How many people is that that you can--
"Lou: I can give that to six so Priya, Pete."
Siobhan: You should heal...
Emily: We're on the roof.
"Brennan: You're on the roof so you can't hit Misty, Kug or Sofia."
"Siobhan: You can't heal me, you can't."
"Lou: Oh, so yeah, Priya, Pete, Ricky."
Ally: Person who fell.
Lou: And that guy—
"Ally: Can you give any to, oh, you can't see him."
Lou: Those people who are partially engulfed in flame.
"Brennan: Cool, yeah, you can give it to all those people."
Lou: Great.
Brennan: And you did 9?
Lou: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool. Rad.
Lou: And then can I use my action to disengage from these two and run for the stairs?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Zac: Upstairs or downstairs?
Lou: Downstairs.
Brennan: Disengage downstairs.
Zac: Oh nice.
"Brennan: You rush past them so that's going to be difficult terrain, your movement’s 30, right?"
Lou: Yep.
"Brennan: You're gonna go 10, 15, cool. You make it to the top of the stairs."
Kingston: Willy! Willy is that you?
Brennan: You see Willy down there. Frozen. Something magical happened to him.
Lou: Great.
Emily: Oh no.
Brennan: Awesome and your Spirit Guardians disappear along with you.
Zac: Do they hit the guy?
Brennan: It's only when they enter or start their turn.
"Lou: Also, I should have made a concentration saving."
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and give that concentration."
"Lou: Oh, [sighs in relief] 19."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Lou: Jesus Christ, that was almost— that was on a 5 for like a true, like three or four milliseconds."
"Brennan: But hell yeah, you make your way all the way there. To the top of the stairs and that's going to be, so that's Kingston's turn."
Lou: [chuckles] I don't like this combat at all.
Emily: I don't either.
[Lou groans]
"Brennan: Pete, my man, that's gonna be you."
"Ally: Okay, cool. 'Cause Priya's awake now, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Priya,"
"Priya: [gasping] Peter, you're carrying me."
"Pete: Yeah, um, we don't have time for this. I need you to yell to all your friends so that we can brush past them and run up to the roof really quick."
"Priya: Everyone, please give us space to create something."
Pete: My god.
Ally: We run and get up to the top of the roof.
"Brennan: Cool, that's five, ten, fifteen, twenty movement gets you up to the top."
"Ally: Ricky, I'm sorry, I'm going to end your concentration. I cast Banishment on Infierno and send her to hell."
"Brennan: Okay, she's going to make a saving throw."
"Ally: Yeah, a Charisma saving throw."
[dramatic music]
Brennan: As a devil she gets advantage against magical spells. This is going to be a Box of Doom roll for sure.
[Murph groans]
Lou: Yaga yaga yaga.
Murph: What does she have to beat?
Ally: I don't know.
Siobhan: And I have my d8 Cutting Words ready.
[Emily chuckles]
[Brennan laughs]
"Murph: 16, that's pretty good."
"Ally: 16, she has to beat 16 and she has advantage."
"Zac: And you're gonna, you can do that?"
Lou: You're gonna cut.
Ally: I'm going to do Bend Luck.
"Siobhan: [to Lou] Yeah, it's a reaction."
Ally: And use two sorcery points to take a D4 away from whatever.
Brennan: Can you do that as bend luck? Can you do that on your action or is that a reaction?
Ally: Oh it's um...
Emily: If you banish her to hell is she just gonna be happy to be there?
Lou: How long is that. Does Banishment end?
Emily: Is that like banishing someone to their home?
"Ally: Any creature you see making an attack roll and ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to spend two sources. So it is a reaction."
"Brennan: It is a reaction. Ya know, I think, can you use your reaction on your turn?"
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: I'll allow you to use reaction on your turn if you want to use Bend Luck to do this.
Ally: Cool.
Brennan: So Cutting Words and Bend Luck are ready to go.
Ally: So she's gone as long as my concentration lasts.
Lou: Yes.
"Siobhan: Yeah, so you can control that."
"Ally: But if it's interrupted, she comes right back?"
Lou: Yes.
"Ally: But if it's not interrupted, she doesn't return?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Murph: Oh, so for the full minute, got it. Okay, so we can kind of make the choice after awhile."
Siobhan: Okay.
Murph: Or you can make the choice.
"Ally: Mm hm, totally."
"Lou: Wait, so will she stay there permanently?"
"Murph: After a minute she stays there, I think, permanently was it? Your intent to... [mumbles]"
"Siobhan: Oh, if you can keep her away for the minute, she stays there permanently."
Ally: And so this is the second one where she is from another plane
"Murph: If the spell ends before one minute has past, target reappears, otherwise the target doesn't return."
Lou: Wow.
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: A minute is almost 10 rounds of combat or like, yeah."
"Brennan: Right, it's almost totally your guys' call, right? Like if you can get out of harm's way, you can choose to keep her there or you just end the spell prematurely and bring her back, whatever works for you guys."
"Murph: I like the idea of having her gone, and then just bring her back."
Emily: Yeah.
Lou: Like all of us in a circle.
Emily: In a circle.
"Ally: She returns to the exact point that she was at, so we can all just be encircled."
Emily: And then you're just like [imitates popping]
Murph: Just preparing reactions.
Ally: It makes a pop sound.
"Brennan: Isabella gets a plus 7 to this roll. On a 9 or higher, she succeeds. However, Bend Luck and Cutting Words are both happening which are going to subtract from whatever the higher of these rolls are. Let's go ahead."
Siobhan: Do you want to throw these on as well?
Brennan: I think you do. I'll throw these first. Let's do it ultra dramatics. I'm going to let you know what her highest roll is.
Siobhan: [whispers] Fuck.
Emily: Maybe it won't even.
"Brennan: 17 plus 7 is 24. To get that under a 16, you need to subtract 9."
Ally: 9.
Brennan: From the roll.
Ally: And what's our possible? A d4 and a d8.
Siobhan: So it's possible.
Lou: You have to subtract 9.
Brennan: You have to subtract 9 from this roll.
"Ally: Yah, at least."
"Zac: Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on."
Ally: 4.
Brennan: And 1.
"Siobhan: 1, no!"
[everyone yells and groans]
Lou: This is not! Our! Day!
"Ally: Wait, can I do, oh no, nevermind. Damn!"
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Brennan: Woo,"
Lou: Well.
Siobhan: I have one more Bardic Inspiration to give out.
Brennan: Pete and Misty both do like a fucking Ghostbusters.
[imitates electrical explosion]
"Brennan: She says,"
Isabella: You fucking bitches. I'm not going anywhere.
Brennan: And infernal runes surround her.
Isabella: I fucking stole Santa's list. I got that fat fuck off his fucking sled. I am [crying] going to marry Robert Moses.
Sofia: Oh my god.
"Misty: What are you, fucking James Bond villain?"
Pete: What?
Sofia: Who you wanna marry?
"Misty: You just fucking telling us your entire plan, you idiot."
Sofia: Oh my god.
Pete: I'm kinda glad I didn't send her to Hell.
Sofia: Yeah.
Pete: We got a lot of great info.
"Brennan: Incredible. So, that's Pete's turn. But Priya is off here to the side, as well, out of harm's way. That's Pete. I'm going to need a wild magic roll."
"Ally: Oh yeah. Oh, I didn't do one last time either."
Brennan: Give me one for last time as well.
Ally: 19\. 3.
"Brennan: 3 for last, rounds over at two, so that's no surge yet."
Ally: Ooh.
Murph: Shit.
Brennan: These guys run and go. These guys [yells] leap off.
Spider: Welcome to the limelight. I'm a big bad boy.
Ally: Is it just a spider?
"Siobhan: He can't hear the spider's language, right? 'Cause only my friend can speak spider."
Brennan: No they just kind of [imitates spider eating].
Ally: Did the spider put a little Beats speaker in the web so it's its own little party? Like it's a host?
Emily: I would bet it's like a sticky slide so it's just a really slow screeching sound.
"Murph: The brutal reality prop of it is probably that they're just thick spider webs, people are falling like 30 feet,"
[Siobhan laughs]
"Murph: Hitting the web, slowing down a little bit, and then falling 15 feet, like rolling their ankles. So hurt."
Siobhan: Like being caught in marshmallow.
Brennan: These guys go unconscious down here because of the smoke.
[slow medieval music]
Siobhan: Oh shit.
"Brennan: These guys rush over here, coughing horribly."
Zac: This is the only way out?
"Brennan: That's the front door, that's the only way out, right there. Then these guys are still pinned in by demons. As are these guys. These guys make a rush through the fire to try and get out. Let's roll a Dex save for them. You see that one of them falls to the flames."
"Emily: No matter what, there's a lot of innocent casualties on her hands."
Zac: Whoa.
"Ally: Yeah, fuck."
"Siobhan: Yeah, truly."
Emily: It was on the fucking dice.
Ally: We have like the best..
Emily: The dice have… We've been in...
Lou: Not if I can help it.
Murph: We've been saving a lot of people.
Emily: Yeah.
Murph: Fucking big ass fourth level spells are getting these people out of here.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Sofia, that's gonna be your turn."
Emily: All right.
"Brennan: At the beginning of your turn, you're injured. You didn't get healed last turn, right?"
Emily: No.
"Brennan: At the beginning of your turn, you take 7 points of damage."
Emily: Okay.
Zac: That's pretty low.
Emily: It's fine.
Brennan: I'm also going to need another Constitution saving throw.
"Emily: Another Constitution saving throw. Mm, that's not going to save unless a 7 saves."
Brennan: A 7 does not save.
Zac: It's not at 10 feet [laughs].
Brennan: No.
Zac: Okay.
"Lou: Hey, I am now."
Brennan: More smoke goes into your lungs. Your speed is halved.
"Emily: That's fine, I’m not, I don’t need to go anywhere right now."
[Brennan laughs]
"Emily: Okay, hold on, how do I do math? Oh, 14, okay."
Siobhan: Don't you have?
Murph: Do you have like a super powerful attack? 'Cause I got that spicy pigeon. Perry's spicy as hell right now.
"Emily: Wait, what did you say? What does he do?"
Murph: I can give you advantage on an attack.
"Emily: Yeah, you gave me advantage, yeah."
"Murph: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Emily: So I'm gonna do that.
Murph: So I'm saying if there's like a--
Brennan: On one attack.
Emily: I'm 100% going to attack.
"Murph: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Emily: Oh, I don't have any like--"
Murph: I'm just wondering if there's like a powerful thing. Cool.
Emily: No.
Murph: Regular attack then.
Brennan: Nat 20.
Murph: Yes.
[everyone cheering]
"Kugrash: Yes, Perry, good job, buddy."
Siobhan: Spicy.
"Perry the Pigeon: Hi, Sofia. We believe in you."
"Brennan: You see that with all the rats and pigeons and shit, La Gran Gata shows up perched on this little spire up there."
Emily: Fucking finally.
La Gran Gata: I knew you could do it. I believe in you.
Kugrash: This is my kind of party.
Zac: So do you get double the...
"Emily: So I get, I also get to add, I also get to add, what's it called? A d4 radiant damage. So then does that also double 'cause I crit? My d4 radiant."
"Brennan: Your d4 radiant damage, if you're below half, does, yep."
"Murph: Yeah, everything."
"Emily: Okay. That's gonna be 20 plus a 4 plus, do I add my proficiency bonus twice? Because when I crit because I add it for to damage for Hexblade’s Curse."
"Brennan: Numerical modifiers don't get doubled in 5E, only dice get doubled in 5E."
"Emily: Okay, so I do 27 damage on my first hit."
Brennan: Jesus Christ.
[Murph clapping]
Emily: Then I'm gonna go to attack her again for a regular attack. Does a 24 hit?
Brennan: 24 does hit.
[claps]
"Misty: Fuck 'em up, Sofia."
Sofia: Isn't that great?
"Ally: We're all here to watch, most of us are on the roof."
Brennan: Remember to add radiant damage.
Emily: Right.
Siobhan: Just folding a circle around the fight.
Emily: That's bad.
Brennan: Your ki empowered strikes are going nuts.
"Emily: 2, 7, so another 10. And then I'm gonna Flurry of Blows, so I'm doing both my smaller attacks that's a nat 1, so it's not gonna hit. But does a 21 hit?"
Murph: Does she—
Brennan: 21 hits.
"Murph: Does she get advantage because of the rats? She's completely flanked, right?"
Brennan: She is completely flanked. I actually don't think flanked in 5E does give you advantage.
Murph: You might need pack tactics or something.
Siobhan: I think maybe for a rogue.
"Brennan: Yeah, you need Pack Tactics, yeah."
"Murph: Yah, you're right."
Emily: And then another 13.
"Brennan: Nice, Jesus."
Emily: So 27 plus 13 plus 10.
"Murph: 40, 50 damage?"
"Emily: Yeah. Oh wait, no, no. More than that. I didn't add my proficiency bonus to the second two. So it's actually plus 6 more."
Murph: 56.
Ally: 56 damage.
Brennan: She has gone from looking a little bit scuffed to looking well and fully injured.
"Emily: And while I'm here, I'm gonna Stunning Strike, full on fucking thing. I don't know if I can do that. Oh wait, do I need to, oh I don't need to, it doesn't say anything about me needing to wait ‘til I have a short rest or anything. I have the ki points, so yeah."
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
Emily: So then I also want to Stunning Strike her.
Brennan: She succumbs to that.
[clapping and cheering]
"Brennan: You go boom, boom, boom, boom, bow, bow. And again, these like big cat paw golden light mitts. [imitates fighting noises]"
[upbeat dramatic music]
"Brennan: On her turn, she beats a full retreat."
[chimes ringing]
"Brennan: Vwoom. And Kingston, you see her appear"
[whoosh]
Brennan: Here in the flames down below. As her only bonus action as she is stunned. But you clock the ever-loving shit out of her.
Sofia: Thank you to the spicy pigeons.
[Murph laughs]
"Brennan: That's Isabella's whole turn. Misty, that's gonna be you. I'm gonna need a Constitution saving throw."
Siobhan: Oh really?
Brennan: Yep.
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: Actually no, I think your silver shoes."
Siobhan: [drops her dice on the floor] Fuck.
"Brennan: Your silver shoes actually protect you from this. Nevermind, you're good. Just tell me what you're gonna do on your turn."
Siobhan: Sorry. [reaching down to grab the die] Okay.
Ally: That'll be a GIF.
"Siobhan: Can I sense where Isabella Infierno went? Or am I just like, oh, she disappeared?"
Brennan: Give me an arcana check.
Siobhan: It's a spicy little 5.
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: You have no idea where she went. She just vanished. [makes poof sound]
"Siobhan: Alright, I'm kinda dumb."
Brennan: Cool.
[Emily laughs]
"Siobhan: But I heard them yelling about Willy, right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
Siobhan: That Willy is on the first floor?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Siobhan: So can I, Misty Step down to where Willy is?"
"Brennan: Sure, absolutely."
Siobhan: Great then I'll do that.
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: Bonus action, you, Misty, step down to where Willy is."
"Siobhan: And then I smack Willy in the face and then I say,"
"Misty: Wake up, you big pile of bricks."
"Brennan: Is there anything you're doing mechanically in this moment to Willy to give him something or to use, 'cause you see he's like disempowered. He's like shut down."
"Siobhan: Oh, okay. Well, I am familiar with Willy. Willy and I go back a long time. Can I check that all of his sigils and runes are correctly?"
"Brennan: Absolutely, go ahead and give me an Arcana check."
Siobhan: God fucking dammit. I'm really not that great at Arcana. 10?
"Brennan: [chuckles] You start to align the sigils and runes on him. Let me see, I'm gonna roll something over here. If you want to burn some kind of magical power of yours to like put it into Willy."
"Siobhan: Can I yell up to Kingston,"
Misty: You know or have which order this is supposed to go?
Kingston: I have no idea.
[Emily laughs]
"Siobhan: Yeah, can I like burn a--?"
Brennan: You can do a Bardic Inspiration or you could do...
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'll give you my final Bardic Inspiration."
"Brennan: I just rolled a nat 20 over here, so I'm gonna allow it."
"Siobhan: Great, thank you."
"Brennan: You go like, “Snap out of it!” Snap and [imitates fizzing] fae magic glimmers out of you."
[whooshing]
Willy: [deep growl] Misty Moore.
Misty: You're looking great.
Willy: You're as beautiful as ever!
Misty: Stop!
Willy: What a meshugas!
"Misty: That's bad, right?"
"Brennan: And Willy begins to animate under your power. That's going to be Misty's turn. Kug, that's you."
"Murph: Oh boy. Okay,"
Kugrash: all right Spideys keep making that web nice and bouncy.
Spider: My butt grows sore from the efforts of all this labor.
"Kugrash: Keep doing it man, you're doing great. Love ya, love your work."
[Lou chuckles]
"Murph: Oh boy, I'm up here with nobody. I'm just a fuck, ba-ba-baa."
"Emily: Brennan, I have a question. If I had Stunning Striked her for the very first time I hit her, would that have given me advantage on attacks on the rest of my attacks that turn?"
"Brennan: I believe so, yeah."
Emily: Cool.
[Brennan laughs]
"Siobhan: Well, you live, you learn."
"Brennan: You live, you learn."
Emily: Wow.
"Zac: Same, same."
"Murph: I'm gonna walk over to the, oh goddammit, [whispering] why is everything a fucking concentration spell?"
Emily: You'll have advantage on her though if you attack.
Murph: You're sure you don't want a Cure Wounds?
"Emily: At this point, what if we wanted to?"
"Murph: I'm gonna do it 'cause I don't want to lose my concentration and,"
Emily: Yeah.
Murph: Doom everyone to die.
"Emily: That's fine, that's fine with me."
"Murph: Cool, so I'm gonna go ahead and do a—"
"Emily: I'm definitely going to get fucked again, so."
"Murph: Yeah, let me do, why not? I'll do a third level Cure Wounds on you. So what is that? So that'll be 3d8. Come on."
Emily: But that does mean that she's stunned right now. Like Kingston and anyone that attacked her right now would get advantage on technically?
"Brennan: That's correct, yep."
Murph: 18.
Emily: Thank you.
"Murph: You're welcome. And then I'll see, do I want to do anything with my bonus action? I don't think so. Maybe I'll,"
Kugrash: I'm sorry rats.
"Murph: I walk over. You know what, I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna move away from the fire a little bit. I'm gonna move myself over like here maybe."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: I'm gonna send my rats down to mix it up.
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: Mix it up, rats."
Brennan: The rats leap down and create a little barricade in between the fleeing people and these other demons.
"Kugrash: [a little choked up] So brave, god bless these brave rats."
"Rats: Chosen of the rat king, we salute you."
[Emily laughs loudly]
Brennan: Incredible.
"Murph: So they get to attack, right?"
"Brennan: How, what’s their movement?"
Murph: Doesn't say on here.
"Brennan: I got it. Rat swarm, rat swarm. Kings men, speed, I don't see..."
Murph: There's no speed on these cards.
Brennan: How weird. I'm gonna say that they have a speed of 30.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: I don't think they can take attacks down there.
"Murph: All right, so they just get down there."
Brennan: That's gonna be the devils. This one turns around to face.
"Lou: Do they take, are they within 15 feet of me?"
"Brennan: Oh yeah, this one is."
Zac: There's one on the stairs.
Lou: Great. [rolling]
Siobhan: Yes.
Zac: There's two devils?
Lou: 12 unless they resist.
Murph: A cat.
Brennan: A cat.
"Emily: What, there's a cat?"
Zac: They fell.
Siobhan: It's your cat.
[Emily gasps]
Brennan: 12 unless they resist.
"Siobhan: His human, her human."
"Emily: Aw, he's so cute. [grins excitedly at La Gran Gata’s mini]"
Brennan: It's a Wisdom.
"Siobhan: Look at all you've got, La Gran Gata!"
Lou: In which case it's 6.
Emily: Hi baby. [imitates kissing]
"Ally: There are three demons that are taking damage, right? 'Cause they're all crowded around the top of the stairs."
Zac: There's three there?
"Siobhan: Yeah, there's three."
"Brennan: Yeah, all three of them are there. This one's going to take some swings at Ricky. Those are both misses. What's your AC right now?"
Zac: It's just 20.
"Brennan: Just 20. No, you still have Haste right?"
"Ally: No, I broke it."
"Brennan: Oh no, you broke it, yeah."
Ally: I broke it to try Banishment.
"Brennan: Just 20. Oh, but that actually, those all miss. That's incredible. So that misses you."
"Emily: I also want to shout down to everyone and just be like,"
"Sofia: Just for the record, my sort of animosity, my vendetta against Isabella feels settled because I kicked her ass and stunned her twice, so don't worry about saving some finishing blow for me."
Brennan: You take 14 points of slashing.
Lou: I do?
Zac: Do I get an attack on whoever did that?
"Brennan: Uh, yes, you do."
Zac: Okay.
"Lou: I take 14 points slashing, dammit."
Ally: What are you at?
Zac: Nat 1.
Lou: Geez. I'm at… 26.
Brennan: You got— I’mma need a Constitution saving throw from you.
Zac: You get plus...
Brennan: Plus 3.
"Zac: Plus 3, dude."
Lou: Plus 3 to my Constitution saving throw. 21 plus 3.
Zac: 24.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you do not lose your Spirit Guardians. They continue to wallop the demons surrounding this place."
Emily: Dang
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Emily: Those are some hardy Spirit Guardians.
Brennan: That's gonna be...
Ricky: Turn the Unholy a bad idea? There's just so many of 'em right now.
Lou: Jesus.
[Brennan imitates fire explosion]
Siobhan: Fuck.
Ally: At ease.
Brennan: These people are just screaming over here as the demons rush past them.
[fire whooshing]
Ally: Can you tell the golem to bust a hole in the bottom wall?
Brennan: These people [whoosh] are consumed in flame.
"Ally: Fuck, no!"
[Brennan imitates explosion]
"Emily: Oh you're gonna have the golem bust a hole,"
Lou: Who's consumed in flame?
"Emily: That's so good, I could just jump over the wall then and get people in there."
Brennan: These people down here [imitates explosion]. The fire spreads to them and is starting to burn them. [fire crackling] The fire has created basically two death save failures.
[Lou sighs]
Emily: Oh my god.
"Brennan: And then, so actually in that case, I will leave them in that space."
Siobhan: So we can see their burning corpses.
"Brennan: Their burning corpses, yep."
"Siobhan: Great, good."
"Brennan: That's going to be, um, that's the fire spreading. The devils have gone. And that fire up there spreads a little bit more as well."
[fire whoosh]
"Emily: Man, how did this happen?"
[whoosh]
"Brennan: That's going to be Ricky, that's you man."
"Zac: Uh, how fucked up do the devils around me look?"
"Brennan: Each of them looks hurt, but not close to being on their last legs."
"Zac: Okay, I might just Turn the Unholy 'cause like even though they’re spreading fire everywhere I feel like that's better than..."
[chuckles]
"Murph: Also, the fire’s spreading off the fire, so."
Emily: Yeah.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool and you have the ability to turn fiends as well, right?"
Zac: Yes.
Brennan: Oh wow and they don't have advantage against this save.
Zac: And it's like...
"Siobhan: Oh, they've been rolling with advantage this whole time?"
Brennan: On everything. They're just magic.
"Siobhan: Oh, fuck man."
Ally: That's why.
Zac: Everything within 30 feet of me.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Nice.
"Zac: So, yeah."
Siobhan: Is Isabella Infierno within 30 feet of you 'cause she's just on the stairs?
Ally: Oh yeah.
[Group chattering]
"Brennan: She may be, let's see."
"Zac: I think I have line of sight, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I think you do too."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yep, she's within line of sight of you."
Emily: And wouldn't she get some sort of disadvantage 'cause she's stunned? So can she not do a saving throw as well?
"Brennan: Um, let me double check that."
"Siobhan: Rules, rules."
"Brennan: Rules, rules."
"Ally: [chanting] Rules, rules, rules."
[Lou snaps]
"Brennan: No, she doesn't roll with disadvantage. I'm going to roll for them right now. Your DC on that, Ricky, is 14, I believe."
Zac: What is?
Brennan: I had that over here. You can double check that.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: And it's a Wisdom saving throw, correct?"
"Zac: It's a Wisdom saving throw, yes. It's just I add my Charisma to..."
Ally: Are you rolling for all four of them?
Brennan: I'm gonna roll for the three demons first.
"Brennan rolls. Seeing his roll, his jaw drops and he chuckles incredulously."
"Brennan: Jesus Christ. People won't believe me. So hold on, I'm going to take a little picture. Um, insane. What do you say?"
[Zac chuckles]
Ricky: It is never funny to play with fire.
[slow victory music]
"Brennan: You lift your axe on high, you hear the distant celestial barking of Ox, [dog barks] all three of them [imitates explosion] are blinded by holy light. And all three of these turn to flee."
"Art Devil: [screams] We are sorry. We didn't understand. [Emily laughs loudly] We will never play with fire again, you big buff man."
[Emily laughing]
Zac: And then.
Brennan: And I'm gonna roll for Isabella real quick. Cool. Isabella does not turn to flee.
Siobhan: You're so wise. I hate it.
Zac: Should I just run down through the fire? See if I can.
"Brennan: So that's your action, yeah."
Zac: I guess I'll just run downstairs through the fire.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: To stand next to her.
"Brennan: Awesome. So you're gonna go. None of them can take reactions, they're all fleeing. That's insane that you just turned those three devils."
"Zac: Whatever, dude, I'm really lucky."
[Brennan chuckles]
"Brennan: So it's gonna be five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five. You are immune to the effects of inhaling smoke. I am gonna need--"
Murph: Have you used luck points today?
Zac: I forgot the first two times.
Brennan: But I am gonna need some Dex saving throws to not take fire damage.
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: Give me three of them.
Zac: Three Dex saving throws.
Siobhan: Do you still have Bardic or no?
Zac: Where's my Dex?
"Emily: Oh yeah, have you used your Bardic?"
Zac: I used it.
"Brennan: 9 doesn't succeed, roll again."
"Zac: 9 plus my, do I add my Charisma to that?"
"Brennan: Oh yeah, you do add that. So you actually do save that, roll again."
Zac: Okay. That's more.
Brennan: Success.
Zac: More.
"Brennan: You rush through the flame [whoosh] unharmed and get down there. You're right next to Isabella. That's Ricky, that's going to be Kingston."
"Lou: Great, can I use a Healing Word to pick up one or two of those people who've fallen right there?"
"Brennan: Yes, you can. I'm gonna say go ahead, there's two of them there. You're not doing a Mass Healing Word but there are just two of them that are clumped there. Give me a Medicine check real quick."
Lou: That's 27.
Brennan: You hit them both with a Healing Word. They both stand up.
Lou: Great and then I'll use Sacred Flame on Isabella.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Lou: She needs to make a Dexterity saving throw.
Emily: Yeah. You've got advantage or something.
Brennan: She is stunned. Do you roll an attack on them?
Lou: It's you rolling.
"Emily: Oh okay, got you."
Brennan: Cool. So good ahead and roll damage.
"Lou: 5, 6, 11 radiant damage."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Incredible. That's going to be Kingston, that's your turn. Pete, that's you."
Ally: Cool. I am going to run and jump off the building onto the juicy [Lou laughs and claps] net.
Murph: Spider.
Ally: And then run in through the front door to face...
"Brennan: Dope. If you want to just jump to the front door, to conserve movement, you might take a little bit of damage, but you are welcome to do that."
Ally: I'll do it.
Brennan: You take 4 points of damage. [health bar depleting]
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: And you [grunts]. Priya goes,"
"Priya: Peter, something's changed about you."
Pete: Bye. [gives a peace sign]
Ally: And I backflip.
Brennan: You leap down. You are standing in front of the door and can feel the heat coming in from the door over here.
"Ally: I can't take someone with me when I Blink, right?"
"Brennan: You can not take someone with you when you Blink, no."
"Ally: Oh, okay, dang. Okay, then I'll cast a Fear on her."
Brennan: There is a shut door unfortunately.
"Ally: Oh, is it locked? I can't get in?"
"Brennan: You don't think you can get in. With Blink you could but unfortunately no. Yeah, there's a door. You can see there's a door and like a solid concrete thing right here."
"Ally: All right, yeah. I Blink, I do Blink."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Blink in and unlock it on the inside.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll to see if you go into the dream around.
Ally: So 11 or higher?
Brennan: 11 or higher you go dream.
Ally: 10!
Siobhan: No.
"Ally: No, wait, I do."
Siobhan: Is it plus your modifier?
Ally: Do I add anything to that?
Brennan: I don't think you add anything to that.
"Ally: Okay, I'm going to use Dual Soul which is advantage on, oh, a saving throw. No, no, wait. Where am I? It's, oh sorry, Tides of Chaos."
"Brennan: Cool, yeah, do that."
Ally: Advantage on a roll.
"Brennan: Yeah, I'll let you do that."
Ally: 8!
Brennan: Oh no.
[everyone groans]
Ally: I'm just banging on the steel door [sounds of banging on door] after looking so cool.
[Brennan and Emily laugh]
"Ally: She sees me go,"
Pete: [smugly] Bye.
"Ally: And then hears me go, [sounds of banging on door]"
"Pete: Fuck, no, fuck."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll Wild Magic for me.
Ally: Oh great. 3!
Brennan: 3!
"Siobhan: Oh shit. Well, at least we get to pick this time."
Ally: Oh yeah right.
Zac: Between the two things.
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: At least you're kind of away from people.
"Ally: [laughs] Yeah, true."
Emily: That's true.
Ally: I'm behind a steel door.
Emily: Maybe you'll get something that's like...
Ally: Melts steel doors.
Emily: Yeah.
Lou: Put out all flames in a building in front of you.
Emily: Hurricane.
Lou: A tidal.
Emily: A very wet hurricane.
Brennan: Hell yes. Hold on one second.
Zac: Building has been put up to code.
"Siobhan: Wow, that's so specific, that was in the DM's guide?"
Zac: A building of your choosing.
Ally: That's crazy.
Zac: We're all rolling like trash.
"Emily: I know, I am too."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I feel like you had the only nat 20."
Emily: Yeah and that was when I had the advantage.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Holy shit. You feel two kind of things happening right now. One of them makes you, you can get really strong. Or you can go somewhere you want to be."
[heart beating]
Ally: Go somewhere I want to be. Appear next to Infierno.
"Brennan: You go [imitates shock]. You feel this weird warping chaos energy. [someone screeching] And then you appear momentarily in like it's something like Sydney, Australia. Hong Kong, Paris, something, something, something. [whoosh] And reappear here next to Isabella Infierno."
Pete: Hi.
"Sofia: Hey, bitch."
Brennan: That's then going to be bystanders. These guys hop off the roof.
Spider: Welcome to the alley.
[Murph chuckles]
"Brennan: These guys charge up here. More people getting ready. Priya's over here. And then these guys make their way up as fast as they can. They're all rushing. Then these guys are going to take a sprint for it. [gasps] Make it all the way here to the steps, past the rats,"
"Rats: Keep going, keep going, you can do it."
"Brennan: And then it's going to be Willy. [stone dragging] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. [whoosh] He gets right over here. [imitates breaking bricks] He looks at these people over here and says,"
Willy: What should you wait in the corner for? You want to get out or you want to roast?
"Brennan: Um, that's going to be, ba-ba-bum, Sofia."
"Emily: Okay, I want to shout out to the Gran Gata and be like,"
Sofia: Is there like something you could turn up there? Is there something that could be turned up there that would like release all the fluids from the water tower?
"Brennan: La Gran Gata says,"
"La Gran Gata: I have given you all this magic, why don't you find out if there is a way to do it?"
"Sofia: Okay, yeah. I was gonna use a Mage Hand, I wasn't asking you to do it but I was just asking you to do the visual survey."
La Gran Gata: Of the place? Maybe?
Emily: [groans] Mother fucker.
"Siobhan: Cats, man. They’re just so fucking flighty."
Ally: They won't do what you want.
"Emily: I guess, you know what, I'm not even going to be able to get in until the door's open anyway, so maybe I'm just gonna run up on the water tower and see if I can just make a bunch of water come out of it. Is that like a waste of a turn?"
"Siobhan: No, I don't think so."
"Emily: Okay, yeah, I'm just gonna jump up on the water tower and look for like some kind of spigot or something."
Brennan: Make an Investigative check.
Emily: This is a fucking waste of time.
Ally: Just sprint through. I bet you could get close to the top.
"Emily: Yeah, this is a waste of time. Well, I could sprint through. But I could also just jump down but then there's no doors open or anything like that."
"Siobhan: I think Willy's about to open the door, right?"
"Emily: Yeah, which is why I was like maybe I use a turn."
Murph: You also have like better attacks than Pete and stuff. You might be able to break down the door.
Siobhan: That's true.
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna run and jump off. I got Slow Fall."
"Brennan: Give me, cool, you're good. You don't need to roll shit."
Emily: It's all good. And then I just want to break down the door.
"Brennan: Cool, you can either make attacks or you can do Athletics checks, whatever you want."
"Emily: Um, I'll make attacks."
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
Emily: 12.
Brennan: 12 does not hit.
Emily: 26.
Brennan: That definitely hits.
"Emily: Okay, I hope this thing is fucking weak. Okay, so, 10."
Zac: Do you add your radiant?
"Emily: Radiant, no, 'cause I'm above. And that's also not going to hit, so just 10 damage."
Brennan: 10 damage. Bang! [door bangs] Hit the door hard. It buckles a little bit under your fist but does not burst open.
Emily: God damn.
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: That's Sofia. Also beginning of your turn, you take, oh no, you got healed, right?"
Emily: I got healed.
"Brennan: Sofia, you're banging on the door. Isabella Infierno steps back."
Emily: Does he get an attack of opportunity?
Brennan: You do get an attack of opportunity on her.
"Zac: If she does, what is she doing?"
Brennan: She's stepping out of your range so you get an attack.
Zac: Okay. 19.
Brennan: 19 hits.
Lou: Ooh.
"Ally: Scariest fistful I've ever seen, Brennan."
Brennan is holding a lot of dice in his hand.
Emily: What is that for?
Zac: A 12?
Brennan: A 12 damage to her?
"Zac: I can't Divine Smite on that, can I?"
"Brennan: On a reaction? Yeah, Divine Smite on a reaction."
"Zac: Okay, cool. And then that would be 2d8?"
"Brennan: If you do a first level spell, it's 3d8."
"Zac: Oh, 'cause she's a fiend?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: Okay then, I'm just gonna do the second level."
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: Yeah.
Siobhan: Fuck her up.
Lou: That's 4d8.
Brennan: 4d8.
"Zac: Okay, so. Okay. [chuckles]"
Ally: Yeah.
"Zac: That's 11, plus 8, 19."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
[cheering]
Brennan: Jesus.
"Zac: 19 plus the 12 that I originally, 31."
"Brennan: Wait, you just dealt, how much smite damage did you do?"
Zac: 19 smite damage.
"Brennan: Jesus, uh, yeah. You see your axe says,"
"Axe: Cleave true, brave firefighter. Flex your pecs."
"[Zac grunts, flexing]"
[imitates bursting]
"Brennan: Ax connects. She steps back and she says,"
Isabella: All you fucking bitches are gonna burn. You're all gonna burn.
"Brennan: [imitates explosion] Raises her hands and fire leaps from her fingers. [fire crackling] I'm gonna need Dexterity saving throws from Pete, Kingston, Misty, and Ricky."
Siobhan: I have advantage. Does this count as a Performance check or just a regular Dex check?
Brennan: It's a Dexterity check.
Siobhan: What if I do it in a real jazzy way?
Zac: Are you guys within 10 feet of me?
Siobhan: I'm not.
Ally: I am.
Lou: Am I?
"Brennan: Pete is, Kingston and Misty are not."
Zac: You add 3 to it.
Ally: Oh okay.
Lou: 10.
"Zac: Ooh, I got a..."
Siobhan: 14.
Ally: 9.
Zac: 23.
Brennan: Even with advantage?
Siobhan: Even with the 3?
"Ally: Adding the 3, yeah. My Dual Soul says I get advantage on saving throws, versus enchantment, or possession."
Brennan: This is not what's happening here.
Ally: All right.
"Brennan: So,"
Siobhan: 14.
Brennan: 14\. Something else?
Lou: 10.
Zac: 23.
Brennan: 23.
Zac: Or 19.
Lou: My man knows how to handle fire.
Brennan rolls his big handful of dice.
"Lou: Get those dice out of here, dog."
"Brennan: 11\. Um, Misty, Kingston, Pete, each take 17 points of fire damage. Ricky takes 8."
"Siobhan: 17 points of damage. Boy, I'm at 9."
Ally: Super low.
"Lou: 17, as am I, I'm at 9."
Ally: I'm at 3.
Lou: [disbelieving] No.
Siobhan: Can you do another Mass Healing Word or are you out?
Lou: I have one third level spell slot.
Zac: 23.
"Brennan: Misty, it's gonna be you. You're surrounded by fire that's actively burning you."
"Siobhan: Okay, sick."
"Lou: Where are you, Misty?"
"Murph: Hell yeah, hell yeah."
Ally: Over here.
Siobhan: Over there in the corner.
"Ally: Where he used to be, the golem."
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Can I, Misty Step like on her fucking back and stab her with my rapier?"
Brennan: Yeah.
Siobhan: That is what I'd like to do.
Brennan: Absolutely.
"Zac: Tight, tight, tight."
[chimes ringing]
"Brennan: You vanish, so you don't take that extra damage going through the fucking wall for fire. You appear, go ahead and make your attack."
[Ally chuckles]
Siobhan: Great. That is a natural 1.
[dramatic whoosh]
Ally: No!
Brennan: You reach up. All your nice silk shit is on fire. You're like [grunts] ah. You reach out with your rapier. You have a hard time landing that blow. Anything else that turn?
"Siobhan: I mean, I used my bonus action. I'm out of Bardic Inspiration and I used my spell."
Brennan: There you go.
"Siobhan: Can I use, oh no, 'cause that would also be a bonus action."
"Brennan: Kug, that's gonna be you."
Murph: Oh boy.
Lou: Kug's been on the roof this whole time.
Murph: I have been on the roof this whole time.
"Siobhan: Oh, fuck."
Murph: I gotta keep concentration 'cause otherwise the spiders will go away.
Zac: Do you have to be line of sight for concentration or what?
Misty: No.
Zac: Okay.
Murph: I just need to not get hit.
Zac: Sure.
"Murph: You know what, okay, so those devils are running away. Basically, I just gotta get down there somehow. Or else, I could try to get on top of the water tower. I wonder if, is the roof leaking that all now that there’s fires been going on for a bit?"
"Brennan: Yes, it is."
Murph: Okay.
Siobhan: Fuck it up. Throw that TV down there.
"Murph: Now I'm gonna do some sheisty shit. Would you allow me to do this? I wanna Misty Step up here, turn into a bear, [Siobhan giggles] and try to knock the whole fucking thing over."
"Brennan: Okay, it's a similar situation to what was with Sofia and you as the ape. If you're gonna try to turn into a bear, you're gonna need a pretty wild Athletics check to do that."
Murph: Okay.
Emily: What if you just tried to go down here?
Siobhan: Oh yeah.
Emily: Would it be like weaker at the base?
"Murph: Okay, maybe I'll just run to the base then."
"Brennan: Cool, you run to the base. You Wild Shape into the form of a bear."
"Murph: I might not Wild Shape yet. Okay, so five, ten, fifteen, twenty. So I'll just take the damage from the fire. And use my movement to get over here to kind of check it out."
Brennan: You take 8 points of damage from the fire.
"Murph: Oh, I gotta roll concentration. That was stupid as fuck."
Brennan: Gotta beat a 10.
Murph: 17.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, great. Cool, you make it to the water tower."
"Murph: Do I see, does it look weakened at all?"
"Brennan: The base, if there's water in there, the base is significantly weaker because of all the weight on top of it."
"Murph: Okay, I'm going to cast a third level Thunder Wave. Just like hit the ground."
"Emily: Ooh, yeah."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: I want to get like under it and it's got like four posts.
Brennan: Yeah.
Murph: Do like the little five foot range and just hit every post.
Zac: Won't it just break and fall onto your head?
"Siobhan: If you do it like on these ones, it'll go in the right direction."
"Brennan: You scurry under the water tower. You see La Gran Gata up on the water tower says,"
La Gran Gata: Hello little rat.
"Kugrash: Hey, we're on the same side here, dude."
"Emily: I hear him from down there and I said,"
"Sofia: No rats, no rats, we aren't hunting rats."
Murph: I want to break these two so it falls this way.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll damage for your spell.
Murph: 2d8 and I said second level or higher. It'll be 5d8?
"Brennan: 5d8, I think so, right?"
Siobhan:[handing dice over] Here you go. You gonna need some more?
[Emily whistles]
"Murph: I got them, thank you."
Lou: Do damage.
Murph: Oh.
Ally: Yeah.
"Murph: Nice. 16, 24, 26, 34. 33."
"Brennan: 33? Shit, I'm going to half the damage to create the DC that the four posts of this structure need to make to succeed. So there's gonna be another Box of Doom roll."
"Zac: You're only going for two of them, right?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Emily: 33, so it has to hit 17?"
"Brennan: Yeah, it's not gonna get any bonus. It's a structure. But it basically for each post is gonna roll a saving throw. It has to get 16 or higher to not blow out."
Emily: On each post?
Brennan: On each post.
Murph: Oh boy.
"Brennan: Let's see how the water tower fares. 4d6, one for each post."
Ally: Yep.
"Brennan: 8, 18, 16, 3. Two posts blow the fuck out. Give me a nature check to see if you can, DC20 nature check, to see if you can control which way it falls."
"Murph: Okay. What I got? 5. Can I give myself, can I use the spicy pigeon to do advantage on it?"
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Emily: Yay.
"Misty: Thank you, Perry, please."
Ally: Hey. 19!
Murph: That's 20.
Siobhan: See if you have crit.
"Murph: Oh god, 26, right now. And then a 20."
"Brennan: Incredible. You see you scurry under there. [screams] You see all the telephone poles [electric sizzling] way out here in Bushwick, all the cables, you see there's a huge fucking rat king tail nest of stolen cable. People patching into cable to steal it. And [imitates static shocks] lightning. Which way does this water tower fall?"
Misty: I'm hoping it like crashes through here and just starts spilling out down the stairs and shit.
"Brennan: Whoosh. La Gran Gata goes “meow!” and vanishes. The water tower [imitates crashing]. Kingston, I'm gonna need a Strength saving throw from you."
Lou: Okay.
Murph: Sorry.
"Lou: Uh, 10."
"Brennan: Uh, 10. Kingston you are knocked prone, fall down the stairs, all this fire fucking vanishes. [whoosh]"
Zac: Does anything happen on the second floor?
"Brennan: Oh yeah, for sure. All this fire, gone. [wind whooshing] It's all fucking toast."
Siobhan: Did we get Isabella Infierno's hair wet?
"Emily: Ooh, that's a good question."
"Brennan: Kingston, you are prone down here at the bottom of the steps. You also take 7 points of falling damage."
"Lou: Cool, I'm at 2."
Emily: Oh. This fight's been brutal.
Brennan: But yet you see Kugrash up above and [boom] a fucking flood of water comes through.
Murph: I peek my head in.
Kugrash: Hey guys.
Kingston: The fuck was that?
Kugrash: Sorry.
"Brennan: Incredible, [imitates water rushing] water floods down here. All of this fire is put out. [dramatic music] This is all gone."
Lou: All of it?
Zac: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Not all, just all of this stuff down near the staircase here. This is a magical wall of fire that Isabella's created [imitates fire whooshing] over here, but you see this person also that had fallen into the fire. Their fire is put out."
Emily: Yay.
Brennan: Roll some death saves for them.
Lou: Don't do this.
Brennan: That person is stable.
"[everyone cheering, Lou wipes his brow]"
Emily: Yay.
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: I haven't used a bonus action yet 'cause I just went over and did Thunder Wave, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, that's correct."
Murph: So I'm gonna move my spicy pigeon. I'm gonna basically prep for next turn. And I'm gonna move my spicy pigeon down to those guys.
Perry the Pigeon: Here we go.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see Perry."
Murph: Under the cover of my friends.
"Brennan: Perry's all the way down here. That's going to be, that's Kugrash. The bugs keep going. Priya leaps down here. She goes [blows],"
"Priya: [panting] Peter, are you all right?"
"Brennan: You see that the spider says,"
"Spider: Hello, young lady, I was wondering if you could put in a good word for me? I have some pieces I've created and I would love for you to take a look at."
Ally: This fucking spider.
Brennan: These devils.
"Zac: It lasts for a minute, I don't know if..."
"Brennan: Yeah, see that they all rush past these guys up here. All rush to the top of the stairs and the roof and begin to fly out into the city skyline."
Ally: Wow.
Emily: Yeah.
Ally: That's crazy.
Murph: Thank you.
[Emily sighs]  
Ally: This fucking fight. This fucking fight is the corn cutie of this season.
[Brennan laughs]
[Emily groans]
"Brennan: That's them. The fire spreads a little bit more down here. [fire crackling and whooshing] These guys back up. A little bit here. That's going to be Ricky, that's you, man."
Zac: I'm taking a step towards Isabella. I'm just going to try to take her out.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Rock and roll, man."
Lou: Rock and roll.
Brennan: You are going to take… I'm going to need a Dexterity saving throw.
Zac: Okay. Nat 20.
Emily: Woo!
Ally: Yeah.
[claps and cheers]
[Zac sighs]
"Emily: I love seeing that come up, even when I didn't roll it."
"Brennan: You gleam with light. [dramatic music] And [imitates whizzing] extending forward from you ax, a blasting jet of freezing water just fucking cleaves the hole through Isabella's wall of fire. You step in right next to Isabella."
Ricky: I cannot stress how much I hate what you're doing right now.
Zac: And then I'm going to just attack her.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Does a 21 hit?
Brennan: 21 hits.
"Zac: Okay, then I'm going, I have one last Divine Smite. So that is 4d8, no, that would be 3d8."
"Brennan: That would be three, one last first level Dvine Smite?"
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: With your ax, it's 4d8."
"Zac: Oh, yeah, yeah, cool. I need two. [Emily and Lou donate dice] Okay. Please. Please. [rolls] Okay."
"Emily: Ooh, I like the way that looks."
Lou: How'd my boy do? How’d my boy do?
"Zac: So 8, 16, 22 points of damage."
Brennan: You [imitates slashing] slash and you see that her Louis Vuitton little leather coat that she's wearing.
Emily: Knock-off.
Ally: I was just going to say that.
Brennan: Tears and reveals a thin flimsy cardboard insulation. And she goes [screams].
Ricky: What's that about?
Isabella: Noooo!
"Brennan: She screams,"
"Isabella: [crying] It's not a knock-off, it's real. I promise."
Ricky: I don't know anything about this but what's the cardboard situation?
[everyone chuckles]
[Brennan claps]
"Emily: I scream under the door,"
"Sofia: She's wearing a knock-off, Ricky!"
"Brennan: She's so badly injured, Kingston that's you."
"Lou: Okay, I stand up and I cast fourth level lightning bolt. [chuckles] So she, I’m gonna roll 9d6."
Siobhan: [laughs] Jesus Christ.
Brennan: Jesus Christ.
"Ally: I look over at Kingston and I'm like, [narrows eyes, impressed]."
Murph: Do you need more?
Ally: How many more?
Siobhan: Just keep piling them on.
"Lou: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. This is it. Oh god. [drops a bunch of dice]"
"Emily: If it fell on the floor, gotta re-roll unless it's a 6."
Ally: I have some for you.
"Lou: This is a 1, I got it. This is a 1."
Emily: Ooh it's multiple sixes.
"Lou: 6, 10, 16, 17, 23, 27, 30."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: You reach your hand up for the residual electricity from the rooftop and not like a wizard extending their hand, you Zeus-like haul a lightning bolt into your hand and just hurl it at her face [static electricity booming] and she is blasted back [fire whooshing] She is still standing."
Emily: You fucking kidding me?
Lou: What?
Siobhan: Are you fucking kidding me?
Zac: When she's flying through the air do I get an opportunity to attack her?
Brennan: No because it's not her move.
Emily: Damn.
"Brennan: You ""Boom!"" You see that her hair-- Oh, her hair completely burns off, leaving a bald, singed scalp."
Emily: Oh my God.
"Brennan: It's Kingston's turn. Kingston, I need a Constitution saving throw from you."
Zac: Plus 3.
Lou: 19.
"Brennan: You do not inhale any smoke down here. Pete, that's gonna be you."
"Ally: I'm going to cast… Man, what can I even do? Can I cast Dispel Magic? Would that do anything?"
"Brennan: Oh, there's a wall of fire. You could cast Dispel Magic on, absolutely."
"Ally: All right, yeah. I'll do that. Level three or lower it instantly disappears—"
Brennan: This is a fourth level spell.
Ally: Okay so you have to roll.
Brennan: Or do you roll that?
Ally: I don't know.
Brennan: I think you roll it.
"Ally: Oh, cool. What is it?"
Brennan: Dispel is going to be--
"Ally: Sorry, I don't have it—"
Brennan: No worries.
Murph: DC equals 10 plus the spell's level.
Ally: So it would be 14.
Brennan: You gotta beat a 14 with your spell attack.
"Ally: Okay, cool. 11."
"Siobhan: No, no, but plus your spell attack. Plus 8."
Ally: Oh! 19.
"Brennan: Fuck yeah. You reach out, and all this Hell shit here, what would you like this to turn into? All this fire, you feel the power of the Vox Phantasmus filling you."
"Ally: I wanna turn this into, like, dreams. Like happy dreams for the people who are scared."
[slow mystical music]
"Brennan: All the people up on the roof that are scared you see every one of these fires turns into a campfire from a summer camp long ago, a burning hearth at Christmas time, someone lighting up a joint with their friends in a little basement. [sound of bong bubbling] And all of it the entire wall of fire vanishes. This is all gone. And I'll even say that this fire over here vanishes. You [whoosh]. All this fire turns into dreams and flits away. Bystanders, these guys jump."
"Spider: Welcome, it's a real hoot down here."
Murph: Those spiders have been working on that web for so long.
"Ally: Yeah, they're doing so great."
"Kugrash: You guys are doing great. I didn't like you at first, weird spider, but I like you now."
"Brennan: Kug, you see that the second floor is not totally abandoned. Your rats are down here that haven't taken an action, I think. There's an unconscious person down there."
"Kugrash: Yep, bring them up baby."
"Brennan: A little like fireman's line of like a bucket starts slowly, [bagpipe victory music] to these stairs here, the rats start like moving this unconscious person down the stairs"
Kugrash: Bring them to Kingston.
Ricky: [pointing] Little heroes.
"Rats: Hey, coming from one of New York's bravest, that means a lot, pal. We really respect what you do."
Ricky: [crying] Sweet.
Emily: Aww.
"Brennan: You see that Willy steps right through this flame, reaches here."
Murph: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: See, you hear a voice say,"
"Willy: Anyone out there, stand back."
"Brennan: The door fucking explodes [punches] as he's, [explosion sound] this huge brick arm blasts the steel door."
"Emily: This all happened pretty quickly, right? So I can pretend like I did that? I'm like, ""Whoa, I did that."""
"Brennan: Yeah, exactly."
Zac: Punch through and it went the other way.
"Ally: Whoa, magic."
Brennan: It just flings across the street and knifes into the middle of a parked Subaru in the street. [car honking]
Ally: Nah.
"Brennan: Just ""Boom!"""
"Zac: Oh, that's one of their cars, for sure."
[group laughs]
"Brennan: You see, he goes,"
"Willy: Sofia Lee, mazel tov on your joining the order of the Concrete Fist."
Sofia: Thank you so much.
Brennan: That's Willy's turn. That is fully-- These bystanders rush out past him onto the street here.
"Zac: [whispering] Yes, yes."
"Brennan: Yes, Ricky."
Zac: Yes!
Brennan: [chuckles] That's gonna be Sofia's turn.
"Emily: Okay, I want to run in but I wanna get a little fucked up by fire."
Brennan: You wanna run through these flames here?
Emily: I wanna run through some flames and take a little bit of damage.
Brennan: You fully take 16 points of damage
"Zac: Oh, God."
"Emily: Sweet, okay."
"Lou: I was like, ""Do not go down on this."""
Emily: Cool. And now I'm just gonna attack her.
Murph: Spicy pigeon.
Emily: Spicy pigeon! So I get advantage on my first one?
Murph: Yeah.
Emily: Okay. So first one.
"Zac: And she's diseased, right?"
Emily: So that's gonna hit. 27 will hit.
Brennan: Isn't a 19...?
"Emily: Oh, a 19's a crit for me!"
"Brennan: I think a 19's a critical, right?"
"Emily: [cackles] It is. So I crit on my first one. 12, plus 5. 17, plus 3 is 20, plus 5, 25 on the first one. I'm gonna attack again. 7 is probably not, wait, 15 is not going to hit, right?"
"Brennan: You have Bardic Inspiration too, yeah."
Emily: Let me add my Bardic Inspiration yeah. But a 24 is gonna hit.
Lou: 24.
Brennan: 24 is gonna hit.
"Emily: Okay, so I hit her for…"
"Zac: God, she is still standing."
"Emily: 13, plus 3 is.."
Murph: 16.
"Emily: 16\. Another 16, so 25 then 16, oh then I also add this. Yeah, you're right."
"Ally: Yes. Wait, what did I just do?"
Siobhan: 16.
"Emily: 16\. So 19, 25, then 19. Now my backhand."
Zac: She’s gotta be dead.
Ally: 44.
Emily: Another 19! Another crit!
[everyone clapping]
"Brennan: All you guys are like flushed. You got no more inspiration. You're no more ki points, right?"
Ally: I'm at 3 health.
Murph: I'm in a hole on the roof.
"Emily: 11 plus 2 plus, 11 plus 2 plus 3 is 16. So another 16 and now my final one. Is not gonna hit. Whatever."
"Brennan: You do 60 points of damage to her in a single round. You see a bald, winged succubus still smoking from Kingston's Lightning Bolt, slashed so many times by the fireman's questing blade. She swiveled as Willy [boom] knocks the door off. You feel Misty's inspiration fill your body. You feel Pete suck the fire out of the room. Kugrash looks down this little hole. Isabella, punch drunk and swaying, looks over at you."
Zac: You're covered in fire.
Brennan: You're fully burning. And you hear this like rushing of trains underneath you.
"Emily: Can we say that my hair is on fire, too? So maybe at the end of this I'll have a cool bob?"
"Brennan: Yep, love it. Hair is on fire. You hear a voice in the back of your head. And then a far away mantra from the monastery. [sound of a gong]"
Jackson: Whatcha gonna do?
Sofia: I'm gonna fuck this bitch up.
Brennan: And you unload.
"Emily: Right before I kill her though, I wanna be like,"
"Sofia: Just so you know, You look like shit when you're bald. Not because being bald looks bad, But because you don't know how to fucking work it."
[Emily giggles]
Isabella: I do know how to—
Brennan: [smash] You uppercut. I'm gonna say that you uppercut her so hard that Sofia and Isabella bust through the floor over here.
[group cheers]
Zac: Jesus.
Brennan: And [crash] through here in the ceiling and you see her teeth and skull scatter into the night sky.
Ally: Her skull?
"Emily: Oh, can I catch a tooth or a bone?"
"Brennan: Yes, you can catch a tooth."
"Ally: Like, what, it's like piñata?"
"Lou: Yeah, what are you gonna do with that?"
Emily: It's a link to Robert Moses.
Brennan: Isabella Infierno is destroyed.
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: Her body disbands into flame and smoke.
Ally: Wow.
Siobhan: More like Isabella Out-fierno.
Brennan: Whoo!
Ally: What did you say?
"Siobhan: Look, I'm out of Bardic Inspiration. Please give me a break."
[laughs]
"Brennan: Those of you remaining in here on your next turn have plenty, I believe actually there's an open path to get up and out of the burning building."
Siobhan: Let's get out of here.
Ally: We book it.
"Ricky: Move, move!"
Lou: Can I bring that man with us?
Zac: I got him.
Brennan: Yes you can.
"Lou: Oh, okay."
Zac: You're so hurt. I was just--
"Siobhan: Can you Lay on Hands him, or...?"
"Zac: I'll just do that, and you carry him."
Lou: Either way is good as long as everybody's safe.
Brennan: You guys all make it out here as the fire spreads. All you guys make it out to the street.
"Emily: I think I feel really emotionally exhausted so I think I wanna come and kind of do what Pete did. Like, do the back thing but just kind of go like this. [crosses her arms over her chest and drops] And just let myself fall backwards."
Brennan: You do a little trust fall.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You hear a voice whisper in your ear as you do the trust fall,"
"Spider: And I you extend the laurel branch of trust, As you have trusted my web, so too shall this—"
"Sofia: Oh, God. I looked down."
"Ally: The whole time while talking, he's pulling a web out of his ass."
Emily: I know.
Brennan: You see pulling a web out of his ass
"Emily: His like, hmm, puckered asshole."
"Brennan: He goes,"
Eustace: My name is Eustace.
Sofia: Eustace?
"Eustace: Yes, welcome to the alley. It's a real hoot down here."
Brennan: You see a bunch of scared--
"Sofia: Can I fashion you a little wig with your little webs, or something? I'm a hairdresser. I don't get to use it much these days."
Brennan: All eight of his eyes tear up. [impersonates the sound of spiders crawling]
Eustace: How I have longed for a pompadour.
Emily: I make him a real nice giddy pompadour.
"Brennan: Incredible. The rats all make it out. Everybody jumps into the webs. You guys stand in the street, the building burning. You have made it through this insane combat."
"Zac: Everyone lived, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Just. I'm on 9, you're on 2."
Zac: I mean all the people.
Emily: The innocents.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah. No one drops."
"Brennan: The innocents, everyone that dropped, you guys spent actions and rounds to get them back up."
Ally: Oh my God.
Ricky: Does anyone drive a Subaru?
[Murph laughs]
"Brennan: You see one of the people who almost died and through Kingston's magic was brought back, goes,"
Bystander: Yeah a Forester. A dark green Forester.
Ricky: I'm sorry. It didn't make it.
"Bystander: Oh God, okay. Wait, just the car didn't make it? That’s fine—"
"Ricky: Yeah, the car didn't make it. We got everyone else but, the car's gone."
"Brennan: And then over to just door chunked in there in the side. [car honking] Willy looks over at you, Kingston, and goes,"
"Willy: Kingston Brown, there are forces moving against us very quickly in the city."
"Kingston: Oh, all right. Willy is that why you were all locked up?"
"Willy: Yes, they found me, and brought me here. They froze me somehow. There are very bad things afoot."
Ricky: Wait. What's going on with Priya? Does she have anything to do with this?
Murph: She's the last.
[Murph's speech drowned out by Brennan]
"Brennan: Yeah, you know Priya's just out, see everyone clears the alley. You hear firefighters begin to descend to this thing. Willy looks over as the firefighters approach and says,"
"Willy: I should go, or find you at The Occult Society."
Kingston: Link up.
"Brennan: He nods, you see he looks over to you Misty and goes,"
"Willy: You know, for something made out of flesh and magic, winks] you're not too bad looking. [laughing grunts]"
"Misty: Oh, well you know for a big pile of rocks, you're not so bad looking lookin' yourself."
Brennan: He looks at you and goes—
Siobhan: I make out with him.
Brennan mimes a massive rock golem holding a tiny woman in its arms.
Murph: [laughing] You’ve only made out with people that are made of rocks.
Siobhan: Don't kinkshame.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
Willy: My place is not too far from here if...
"Misty: You know I gotta deal with my friend, but you know maybe it'll rain check."
Willy: Rain check.
Misty: Rain check. Rain check.
"Willy: Misty, I owe you one. [taps his heart]"
[Emily chuckles]
"Brennan: And he [whoosh] strolls down the street. Priya looks over to you and goes,"
"Priya: Peter, I don't know what I saw this night, but you were extraordinary."
Pete: Thank you. What the fuck was that? What was it supposed to be? What was the performance?
"Priya: Well the piece is called ""Cruelties""."
"Pete: I remember. I remember that it's called ""Cruelties of a Relationship."""
"Priya: I wanted to explore the ways we've injured each other, through the power of art."
Pete: What were we gonna do?
Priya: Talk about the different ways we've—
"Pete: Okay, lemme just, it's just, common courtesy as you would've. Remember when we met up at that coffee shop, and we were talking?"
Priya: Yes.
Pete: And each of us could have said anything.
Priya: Right.
"Pete: Remember how you were like, ""Come to my art show."""
Priya: Right.
"Pete: You could have been like, you are actually 100% of my art show."
"Priya: Right, but had I told you, you would've been less injured by the sudden betrayal, and that's part of it."
"Ally: I cast Minor Illusion on her, and so she thinks that all of her limbs were burned off."
[screams]
Brennan: She screams.
[Siobhan laughing]
Pete: Let's get you to the hospital.
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: You get her to the hospital. Well the rest of you injured, badly injured, but everyone's safe. Ricky you check on everyone. Everyone is safe with some smoke inhalation, but the ambulances and fire trucks start pulling up before you guys take your injured selves outta here. Does anyone do anything left at the building?"
"Murph: Yeah, Isabella said she took the note or the list."
Zac: Can I look again?
Emily: Yeah.
Murph: Can we see?
Emily: Is there anything left on her person?
Murph: Can I search her body before I jump off that?
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Left on her person, it looks like she didn't bring anything with her here to fight."
Murph: Okay.
"Brennan: Looking at it, and looking at Willy being captured here, it seems almost as though. And actually anyone can Insight check that wants to."
Lou: Nat 20.
"Emily: Ooh, I got a..."
Brennan: Nat 20.
Zac: Nat 1.
Emily: I got a 21.
Ally: 15.
Siobhan: I got a 23.
Zac: Nat 1.
Emily: Not nat though.
Brennan: You know what this was. This was a trap. This was not you guys going to fuck their shit up. This was them coming to where they knew you were gonna be.
Emily: Can I do some kind of...
Ally: Which means that they used Priya.
"Emily: Yeah I was gonna say like, can I do some kind of like, check on Pri-- Oh wait no, Priya's just screaming 'cause she thinks her limbs are on fire."
"Ally: I dismiss my Minor Illusion, it was too mean."
[Brennan starts panting]
Emily: I just wanna like—
Pete: Oh it looks like you're fine!
"Emily: I just wanna do some kind of like, Insight check if like, if I, if she's—"
"Brennan: On a nat 20 insight, Priya doesn't know shit."
"Emily: Okay, she was just a pawn."
Lou: Priya doesn't do shit.
"Siobhan: I don't regret casting Fear on her, she seems like a bitch."
"Emily: Yeah, she seems like she's nuts."
Zac: Can I make a Perception check to see if anyone's like watching us from...
Brennan: Yeah go for it.
Zac: I got a 18… No a 19.
"Brennan: You look around and you are standing next to Kingston, both of you guys are looking here as kind of like the civic guys. You look out and [somber music playing] you see shadows retreating from this place. It feels in your heart of heart, Kingston, as you just listen to the city. And you also feel, I think after your experiences in Nod, more whole. And after making things right with Pete, you feel that your two magics working together are only making you stronger than you've ever been. Even in your prime, when you were in your thirties. You look around and feel that this was a monumental defeat for the forces of evil in the city. And that they have seen the power of you six champions, and are pulling back either in full retreat or simply to buy their time. But either way this victory cannot be overstated."
"Kingston: This was a monumental defeat for the forces of evil in this city. And you know, they've seen what we're capable of, and I believe at this time they are taking a step back, or something like that."
"Emily: I wanna text Mario and be like,"
"Sofia: You definitely underestimated me, because I went up against Isabella Infierno, and I'm walking away and she's not."
Brennan: [laughs] Go ahead and roll an Intimidate check.
Ally: It's December 20th right?
"Brennan: December 20th today, yep."
Emily: 12.
Brennan: 12. There's a little ellipsis and no response.
Sofia: Coward.
"Kugrash: So she sh— Your interaction with Dale. Do you think it's possible if Isabella had the list, if maybe Dale's not even fully dead or something? If he got like sent to Heaven by the list."
"Misty: Oh yeah, maybe."
Kugrash: Or something like that?
Misty: 'Cause he's on the good boy list?
Murph: If somebody fucked with something.
Sofia: I got the impression it was little bit more of like a hit type thing.
"Ricky: He said, ""I'm not alive anymore"", he never said he was dead."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Sofia: Oh my god.
Siobhan: Can you ask Jackson if he has any more information? If Dale was a member of the Concrete Fist.
"Emily: Uh yeah, I'll text Jackson and be like,"
"Sofia: Jackson, I got some questions for you. I also got some very interesting intel for you."
"Brennan: You get a text right back from Jackson saying,"
"Jackson: Come by the monastery, let's talk."
Sofia: Okay.
"Brennan: You see that, cool, the ambulance has come you guys are all injured and fucked up. Where do you guys all go that night? I guess you're headed to the monastery. Ricky, you head back to your place."
"Sofia: Does anyone wanna come to the monastery with me? Everyone's busy, that's fine, you know."
Kingston: I’mma go home.
Misty: Staten Island?
"Brennan: Misty's home, Kugrash goes back to--"
Murph: I'll go to Wally's.
Brennan: You go to Wally's.
Murph: I'm gonna start crashing at Wally's.
Brennan: You can start crashing at Wally's.
Siobhan: I'm gonna do this ritual that I got all this stuff for.
Brennan: You gotta go take care of some business.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Kugrash you go back to Wally's. You see he says,"
"Wally: Dad, I got you a little dog bed, but I'm gonna put it up on the table so it's like a real person bed."
Kugrash: That's the nicest—
Murph: I start crying again.
"Kugrash: That's the nicest fucking thing anyone's ever done for me, you beautiful bastard."
Murph: I give him a big wet dad kiss.
"Brennan: He like scratches your furry cheeks. He's like,"
Wally: I love you Dad!
Kugrash: I love you Wally.
"Brennan: You see that he puts a little thing of… He went and got like a charcuterie cheese assortment, and puts it there next to you."
"Kugrash: This is fucking fantastic. I've been eating garbage for like 35 years, Jesus."
[Emily and Brennan laugh]
"Lou: On the bus ride home, can I talk to Pete?"
Brennan: Yes.
Kingston: You see that Lightning Bolt?
Pete:[holding onto a bus handhold] That was amazing.
Kingston: Not bad right?
Pete: You were tryna kill her.
Kingston: I was—
Pete: That's a new color for you.
"Kingston: Ey, what can I say, but hey, man, I wanted to say I never gave you that apology."
Pete: Yeah.
"Kingston: But I know, I guess you saw some things in Nod that, I don't know what they were, but yeah, man, I'm sorry."
"Pete: I'm sorry too. I saw how much you gave up to protect all this, and I came in and I don't feel a lot of protection over stuff, 'cause I haven't been too attached to stuff in my life so, it has never really made sense to give up being wild for something until now."
"Kingston: I mean if I saw that, no more drugs, and you saved Priya?"
Pete: Yeah. [sighs]
"Kingston: Okay, Pete!"
Ally: I eat some more tomatoes as we're talking.
Brennan: You guys arrive back. I'm gonna say that Kingston puts on a nice jazz record when you get back.
Lou: Of course.
Siobhan: Oh my goodness.
[jazz music starts playing]
[Ally starts mimicking a saxophone]
"Brennan: You guys chat all night talking about New York. And that night Kingston you sleep, you have good dreams for the first time in a long time. And Pete you sleep, the sleep of death, and have the first good sleep you've had in years."
Ally: Yes!
Brennan: And that's all for this episode of The Unsleeping City. Tune in next time guys.
[cheers]

[RECAP]
"Isabella: You fucking bitches, I'm not going anywhere. I fucking stole Santa's list. I got that fat fuck off his fucking sled. I am gonna marry Robert Moses."
"Kingston: Willy, is that you?"
"Willy: Anyone out there, stand back."
"Brennan: The water tower, boom, crashes. All this fire fucking vanishes. You hear a voice in the back of your head."
Jackson: What you gonna do?
Sofia: I'm gonna fuck this bitch up.
[loud booming]
Brennan: Up through here to the ceiling. Her teeth and skull scatter into the night sky.
"Willy: Kingston Brown, there are forces moving against us very quickly in the city."
[END RECAP]
[“Deck the Halls” playing in the background]
"Brennan: Here we go, guys. Are you guys ready?"
[table slapping]
"Brennan: [singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la la la la la la!"
All: [singing] Fa la la la la la la la la!
Brennan and Emily are both wearing Christmas sweaters.
"Brennan: Hey, guys, and welcome back to ""The Unsleeping City"". I'm Brennan Lee Mulligan, these are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
All: Hi intrepid heroes!
[all singing over each other]
Ally: [singing] Oh Santa.
"Brennan: It's a very, what a very festive episode we have here, probably airing sometime in like July or August. But whatever, it's not the time that the campaign is set in."
Emily: That's when you miss Christmas the most.
Zac: That’s true.
"Emily: Or the holidays, pardon me."
"Brennan: The holidays, yes. Gang, last we left our intrepid heroes, they were in a burning art loft somewhere in Bushwick where they had just defeated Isabella Infierno, the lieutenant and fiancee of Robert Moses and the murderer of Dale Lee. Our heroes went their separate ways. Misty back to her penthouse. Kugrash to a little dog bed in Wally's apartment. Ricky back to his studio and his weights and protein shakes."
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: Sofia back to Staten Island and her house.
Emily: [flatly] Mm.
Brennan: And [laughs] Kingston and Pete stayed up late listening to jazz and chatting before they each got their first good night’s sleep in a long time.
Ally sighs contentedly.
Lou: Oh yeah.
"Brennan: It is a bright, sunny morning. It is brick city, a freezing day. One of those days in New York where it's extremely bright and extremely cold. Little bits of dust and wind kick up, cutting through people's coats. We are gonna go ahead and start at Kingston Brown's apartment the following morning. You guys wake up. Your shift starts a little bit later, so you have the morning to yourself. [little snore] Pete, you come to. It's that first night of long like 11 hour sleep after a bender that has lasted for whoever knows how long. So like eye crusts, snot crust. Like sweaty and like hot and you're like, oh, my body actually got a chance to heal itself of all these stress injuries over the course of the night. What do you guys do as you awake that morning? It is December 21st, by the way!"
Murph: Mm.
Ally: Ooh!
Siobhan: Oh my goodness.
"Lou: Well, if it's December 21st, I’m making breakfast."
Zac: Classic December 21st.
Lou: Classic December 21st breakfast-making.
Emily: Is it the solstice? The 21st?
"Brennan: The longest night of the year. Yes, that’s absolutely right."
Ally: Mm.
Emily: Oo.
Ally: Cool.
"Lou: Well, I'm making breakfast just because. You know, we're gonna have some grits. We're gonna have some pancakes, scrambled eggs. I got some Polish sausage from down the way."
Ally: Woo.
"Lou: You know, we're gonna do it right."
Ally: Cool. I take the broom out and I just kinda start sweeping. 'Cause it's hard to not be doing something when you're treating me so well.
"Kingston: Pete, you don't have to sweep nothing."
Pete: I'm picking up a little bit of dust here and there so uh...
"Kingston: Hey, more power to you."
Pete: All right.
"Kingston: Hey, you want cherry tomatoes in the eggs?"
"Pete: Oo, yes, that sounds delicious."
Kingston: You got it.
Brennan: You hear a knock at the door at your apartment door.
"Kingston: Hey, Pete, can you get that?"
"Pete: Yeah, sure. Hello."
"Brennan: You open the door and see an extremely twee, cute old couple that are dressed up in sort of, you know, house clothes. There is a tiny, bespectacled old woman. And an extremely grumpy-looking old man with a cane. You recognize these must be Kingston's parents from downstairs. Victoria looks at you, seeing a stranger in Kingston's apartment, and doesn't have any… Bat an eyelash at all and goes."
Victoria: My goodness. Are you Pete?
Pete: I am Pete.
"Victoria: I'm Victoria, come here."
"Pete: Oh, you must be Kingston's parents. Oh."
Victoria gives Pete a hug and kisses both his cheeks.
"Brennan: She takes a sort of Saran-wrapped, it's one of those things where it's like a little tin of what used to be cookies. Opens the tin and there's Saran-wrapped, homemade cookies in it. Plastic's on the thing. You see that the old man looks at you and goes..."
[grumbles and nods]
"Pete: Good to meet you, sir."
"Winston: [low, very raspy voice] Hi, my name is Winston Brown."
Pete: Firm handshake.
"Brennan: Gives you, just glares, looks over at Kingston. Gives you this look that he often gives you, 'cause you have, of course, kept, gotten people back up on their feet in your apartment many times before, gives you a look like…"
"Winston: Trouble, kid trouble?"
"Kingston: Absolutely not, Pop. Get in here. Also, Mom, it's much too early for cookies."
"Victoria: Why, why, why would you say it's too early for cookies?"
"Kingston: Mom, it's 9:00 a.m."
Ally: I'm eating a cookie.
Kingston: Okay.
Pete: These are amazing. Thank you so much.
Victoria: You can have cookies anytime you like. That’s too sweet!
Pete: Wow.
"Kingston: Mom, go sit down, all right?"
"Victoria: All right. You don't tell me what to do. I am tired though, I mean, it's a long flight up! These stairs. We gotta get someone in the building about these stairs."
"Ally: Can I text Ricky and be like,"
Pete: Are cookies the good carb?
Ricky: Absolutely not.
Zac: Cranking this treadmill up.
"Pete: Shoot. Okay, ah, damn."
Ricky: But have fun with your life.
Pete: Ricky's helping me put on size.
"Kingston: Oh, oh, word up. All right, Pete. Okay, Pete."
"Brennan: You see that Pop looks over at you and says,"
"Winston: Put on size, that's a problem, put on size. And you know, back in my day, the leading men in the movies, they had, you know. John Wayne didn't have size. He had grit."
"Kingston: All right, ain't nobody needing to be admiring John Wayne, Pop."
Winston: What's wrong with John Wayne?
Kingston: There's so much wrong with John Wayne.
"Winston: What's wrong with John Wayne? I like a western movie. He had a big chest and skinny arms 'cause when you throw a punch, you throw from the chest. You don't throw from the… You know what I'm saying?"
Pete: I actually heard John Wayne was put up by the person who made The Hollywood Reporter. He actually invented John Wayne. They put him in a lot of articles.
Winston: I don't know anything about all that. I don't know anything about all that.
"Pete: He wasn't anyone. They just put him in all these articles. And then, all of a sudden, all the people wanted to work with him. I got a, you should read it."
Kingston: Pete does a lot of real cool stuff. He's a good dude. He's really into the arts.
"Brennan: You see Victoria looks over and says,"
"Victoria: Well, you're an artist, that's amazing. What kinda art do you do?"
"Pete: Oh, I mostly hang out with other artists. I just like art. But I'm not, I—"
Winston: You some kind of critic? You an art critic?
"Pete: No, no, no. Definitely not, no."
Winston: This kid an art critic?
"Kingston: No, Pop, he's not an artist. Pete is… What would you...What is your..."
Pete: I run deliveries.
Kingston: There you go.
Pete: Just kind of like a blue collar job.
"Brennan: You see that the, yeah. Winston looks over and says,"
"Winston: So, what's bringing you over here to Kingston's apartment? Why are you staying with Kingston for a little while?"
"Pete: Oh, we have a lot of mutual friends."
Kingston: Yes.
Brennan: You see that Victoria kind of like blindly nods to this and Winston kind of crosses his…
Winston: You two run in the same circles? I noticed that you've drawn on your fingers.
Pete: Oh yeah. Yeah. I have some tattoos. I have some tattoos.
Kingston: Me and Pete recently started playing chess together. We joined a—
"Brennan: You see Pop goes,"
Winston: That's a great game. That's a great game.
Pete: Mm-hmm.
Kingston: It's a great game. Pete is very good at chess.
Winston: That's a great game.
Pete: Yeah.
"Brennan: So you see Victoria, without missing a beat, looks over at you, puts another cookie in your hand, also gets up to start just help you with breakfast."
"Kington: Mom, stop."
Victoria: What?
Kington: Sit down.
Victoria: Why can’t I…
Kington: I am cooking breakfast.
"Victoria: [hands up in defeat] All right, all right. It's your kitchen, your rules."
"Kingston: Yeah, my kitchen. When I'm downstairs, you're in charge. When you're upstairs, I'm in charge."
Ally: I'm furiously sweeping now.
"Brennan: She sits down and says,"
"Victoria: So well, Pete, what are your plans for Christmas? Do you celebrate Christmas?"
"Pete: Um, I grew up celebrating Christmas, yeah. I don't really have any plans."
Victoria: Well!
"Victoria whips her head around to stare pointedly at Kingston, who shrugs good-naturedly."
Pete: Yeah.
"Victoria: We’re having family over, a bunch of people driving into the city. You should feel free to come."
Pete: I would love to.
"Kingston: Oh, Pete, it'll be—"
Victoria: Is that all right? Am I overstepping my bounds? Can Pete come for Christmas.
"Kingston: Not a chance. It would be a hoot and a holler to have you there, Pete."
"Pete: Cool. Oh man, that means so much. This is such a warm, sweet place."
Victoria: That's wonder…
Brennan: She gets up and pulls a little thing out and just starts measuring your body.
Victoria: What size shirt or shoe are you?
Pete: Large.
Victoria: Large? Okay. Are you sure?
Pete: Huh?
Victoria: Are you sure?
"Pete: Yeah. Large, if I—"
Victoria: Is that the style?
"Kingston: I mean, he's putting on size."
"Pete: Yeah, I'm putting on size."
Kingston: This is the sweater you're gonna grow into.
"Pete: Yeah, yeah yeah."
"Victoria: All right. Well, so if you're putting on size, so I should make extra food for you is what you're saying."
"Pete: Yeah, that'd be great. Um, do you have like complex carbs and pure protein?"
Victoria: We were gonna have turkey.
"Pete: Great, that's great. I'm sorry, I'm talking like Ricky."
"Victoria: And we also do a ham, a Christmas ham. It's traditional, so..."
Kingston: Yeah. We're doing it all. You know how to play dominoes?
Pete: Mm-hmm.
Kingston: Great. It’s gonna be good
"Brennan: You see that Winston reaches into a little coat pocket and pulls out a single domino and does the like finger trick with it. He says,"
"Winston: Oh, you think you know how to play dominoes. Well, this should be very interesting."
"Kingston: All right, Pop, no money. There's no, we agreed two Christmases ago—"
"Winston: You gotta spice up the game, Kingston!"
Kingston: You can't gamble.
Pete: I agree.
"Winston: You gotta spice it up. Dominoes without money? Come on, that's crazy. That is a crazy thought."
Kingston: All right.
Pete: I always put money on dominoes.
Kingston: Okay.
"Pete: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I wanna be on your team with this, but—"
"Brennan: As soon as you say that, Winston goes [laughs] and punches you in the shoulder."
Winston: I like this kid.
Ally: I pretend it didn't hurt but it hurts so… It went straight to the bone.
"Kingston: All right, y'all, breakfast is ready, okay? Nobody needs to be punching nobody or gambling on no domino."
"Brennan: Kingston's delightful parents fill the room with conversation. You see that without even asking to, Victoria moves some food off of her plate onto your plate as she finishes. And you see that you… Delightful breakfast. As it gets closer to time to go to work for Kingston, you see a little thing bleeps up on your phone."
Ally: Cool. I open it.
"Brennan: It's a text from 53V3N, basically saying like"
53V3N: We need to talk. Like we need to talk. Have you moved the last batch yet? Let's talk about re-upping soon.
"Ally: Cool, yeah I write like,"
"Pete: Yeah, I can swing by today."
"Brennan: Rad. Cool. Kingston, make a Perception check."
Lou: That's gonna be a 19.
"Brennan: You notice, you're not trying to eavesdrop, but you're a very observant guy, so you notice that little text sort of show up on Pete's phone."
"Kingston: Hey, Pete, I'm about to go to work. What are you up to today?"
Pete: I'm gonna go take care of...
Kingston: Business?
"Pete: Business. Yeah, yeah."
Kingston: But you won't be participating in business.
"Pete: No. No, I won't. I just got a trial membership at a gym and I'm gonna go swimming afterwards."
"Kingston: Oh. Okay, Pete, Ricky would be thrilled to hear that."
"Pete: I don't know if swimming is the right choice, but I did Google mass exercise and swimming."
Kingston: Mass exercise?
Pete: I'm trying to gain mass.
"Kingston: Oh, for mass. Okay."
Pete: I don't know.
Kingston: Got it.
Pete: We'll see.
"Kingston: Word up. Well, hey, have a good day."
"Pete: Yeah, you too."
"Brennan: Kingston, you take off for work. Pete, you also take off for work."
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: We're gonna cut over to Misty. You awaken in your beautiful penthouse. The forces of evil took a real bad beating at that party and you finally have a morning to look at your lines. You see that Benjamin shows up with a little thing of fruit salad and some bagels. He sits down and says,"
"Benjamin: All right, so we're taking it from the top tonight? Is that what we're doing?"
"Misty: I think so, right?"
"Benjamin: Absolutely. Let's get these ivories a-kicking. Here we go. Two, three."
"Brennan: And just as he's about to start, you see Alissa walks in and says,"
"Alissa: Hi, Ms. Moore, sorry to interrupt, am I? Oh, sorry. Am I, is this a bad time? Should I come back? Am I, I'm so sorry."
Misty: Tell me what you need to tell me. You've already interrupted.
"Brennan: Benjamin goes,"
Benjamin: [clicks lips] Wow.
"Brennan: Um [laughs] And Alissa walks over to you and says,"
"Alissa: Um, so, I am so sorry about interrupting the last rehearsal, everything is set up. And I took extra precautions, so everything is where it needs to be in the theater and I didn't let anyone see me do any of it for whatever reason. But there's some questions about the legal paperwork you asked me to look forward about your, the trust fund, and your last will and testament."
Misty: Mm-hmm.
"Alissa: This is all, it's all been notarized and everything's set up. The name of the individual that's set to inherit your estate should you pass away is still TBD and there were some questions about that."
"Misty: Yeah, no. Well, I'm a single lady and I've had a fun life. But I do want to leave my stuff to some people, or a person, who maybe I haven't figured out what that name is gonna be yet. [quickly] I mean, who they are yet."
[Brennan laughs]
"Brennan: You see, she looks at you. Go ahead and make a Deception roll for me real quick."
Siobhan: That is a not natural 20.
"Brennan: You see she goes,"
"Alissa: Okay. So sorry, yes, do I need to get name change informa… No, there is a person who is going to inherit your estate."
"Misty: Yes, absolutely, a beautiful young woman."
[Emily chuckles]
Alissa: So you do know who it is. Can we get her name?
Misty: Mm. How about...
"Brennan: You see Benjamin goes,"
"Benjamin: How about? Misty, can I inherit your estate? What's happening?"
"Misty: Oh, darling, you know I love you and you're gonna be looked after."
"Benjamin: Okay, well good, I guess. [chuckling] I would hope so. Been here slinging tunes on these pianos for a long, long time, Misty."
"Misty: Yes, yes, and you've had a job that whole time haven't you, Ben?"
"Benjamin: Wow, meow, claws are out, I suppose."
"Misty: Alissa, you're done. I'll figure it out. I'll send you a text message with the name."
Alissa: Okay. So I'll get the name in a text message?
Misty: I'll send you a text message.
"Alissa: Okay, wonderful. I'll look out for that text and I'm just trying to think if there's anything else here. Some of the things, they just wanted clarification on some of the things that are being willed here. Because it just seems like you know who this person is, because you're willing some of your clothes that have specific measurements for a person that, again, we don't have a name or a social security or a banking account."
Misty: I'm just assuming that anybody who I would give my estate to would have a specific shape and size of figure.
"Alissa: Misty, I will--"
"Misty: Alissa, what do you need from me? Why, I'm in rehearsal."
"Alissa: I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. I apologize. It's not my place to ask these questions. And, I swear to God, it will not happen again."
"Misty: No. No, it won't."
Alissa: Okay.
Brennan: And she...
Misty: How many times?
Alissa: [beleaguered] I am so sorry.
"Brennan: And she swishes out the door. You see Benjamin goes,"
"Benjamin: Very well. So, maybe we should, you know, we got a little bit of an interruption. Do you wanna just go to the final sort of aria? I mean, you wanna go to the last big movement?"
"Misty: Yeah, let's do it, let's do it."
"Benjamin: Okay, this is ""If We Shadows Have Offended"" okay. Two, three, four. [singing and miming piano playing] Ba dum bum, ba da da da dum"
Brennan: And you start belting out this real belty final number. Wonderful. What does Misty do in the days preceding her little holiday cast party and Christmas coming around the corner?
"Siobhan: Well, the winter solstice is a big holiday for me. So I'm gonna decorate my house and also put my little saucer of milk by the fireplace to stop the faeries from stealing my children, as is traditional."
"Brennan: Little saucer of milk placed out and a bunch of little Old World, Celtic, pagan things happening. And, yeah, it's beautifully set up. You also notice, by the way, I imagine that you had told Alissa to get rid of the mirror in your place."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I think so."
Brennan: So the mirror is now gone.
Siobhan: It's in storage.
Brennan: Yes.
Siobhan: Along with all of my other weird shit that is in storage.
Brennan: From centuries of collecting crap. Wonderful. So you get ready for the lovely solstice.
Siobhan: I'd also like to check in with the faerie population that is around to see if there's any like scuttlebutt going around about what's happening with Titania just so that I can protect myself from...
Brennan: Give me an Investigation check.
Siobhan: Great. How about a 5?
[Ally chuckles]
Brennan: You reach out to get some scuttlebutt. You don't hear jack shit about Titania.
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: You hear that the clock gnomes of Grand Central Station appear to be in a little bit of an uproar. Something's going on with them.
"Siobhan: Oh. I'll head down to Grand Central Station, buy me some oysters."
Ally: Mm.
Emily: Mmm.
Sofia: Get a Junior's cheesecake to go for the party.
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: Ooh, lovely. Cool, you head out. So this is like on the 21st, you go out and head out."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Brennan: Or maybe you're like decorating that day and the next day you head over there. Cool. Just with everyone else, just seeing what you're doing. We're sort of in this little downtimey, Christmassy spot as you guys are doing this stuff. Sofia."
"Emily: Okay, well I am going back and I'm closing up my house. I won't be staying there anymore, so I'm packing a bag. And then I also want to, I'm gonna get in touch with Jackson. But before I do, I would like to spy on my family."
"Brennan: Okay. Yeah, absolutely."
"Emily: So what I'd like to do, and you'll tell me if I can do this, is create an Unseen Servant. And then cast Gaze of Two Minds on it."
Brennan: [impressed] Holy shit.
Emily: And then send it into wherever my family's hanging out.
Brennan: Okie—
Emily: Specifically my brothers and possibly my father. I don't—
Siobhan: Did you take another level of warlock?
"Emily: Yeah, bitch."
Sofia: You cannot stay away.
Emily: I love spells. Give me cards.
Brennan: I think this is totally legit.
"Emily: I think it is 'cause it needs to be a willing humanoid, but then it says the servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do."
Brennan: So you backdoored your way into having Clairvoyance as a second level warlock.
Emily: [smugly] Maybe.
"Ally: Yes, bitch."
"Lou: Yes, bitch."
Ally: That's amazing.
Siobhan: Emily's been on Reddit for hours. How can I backdoor some shit?
"Emily: Actually, I didn't even think of it till I sat down here. I got Gaze of Two Minds to try and convince Mario to be on my side, but then I was like, wait a second."
Brennan: Incredible. Yeah. You look at… So you--
Emily: So I'm on like a full sneak mission like--
Brennan: Give me a Stealth as you're just sort of on the street.
Emily: Okay. Oh my god. Okay. That's gonna be a 27.
"Ally: Oo, fuck yeah."
Emily: La Gran Gata channels through me.
"Brennan: You see, it is again, this bright, it's brick fucking cold out here. It is freezing."
"Emily: I don't care, it's colder in here. [taps her heart]"
"Brennan: You summon… You see there is a [purring, gentle windchimes] and sort of coming out of being ethereal, La Gran Gata sort of does that cat rubbing and weaving in between your legs. And then wraps around one of your feet. You see that outside of the heat of battle last night, you see that La Gran Gata is kind of mirroring your emotional state."
Emily: Oh.
"Brennan: But in that sort of comforting animal way. Like when a dog sees you being sad and it's like, I'll be sad too."
"Emily: Oh, okay."
Brennan: Yeah.
Sofia: I gotta get you registered as a pet therapy animal so I can bring you on planes.
La Gran Gata: There is no TSA or flight attendant that can stop me.
"Sofia: Ah, now that's the spirit."
[La Gran Gata meows]
Sofia: Oh my goodness. So cute and yet so revered.
Brennan: You conjure up this little. You sort of use your ki and create this little messenger of wind and air elemental thing. And you lean against the brick wall of the alleyway. Your eyes go white and you go blind and your vision centers a little. And it whisks down this Staten Island street up into the chimney and down into the home of the Bicicletas. What is the duration of Unseen Servant?
Emily: It's one hour.
"Brennan: One hour, cool. You see that the unseen servant goes down through the chimney. Your family is home. Your mother, your father is like in a seat, kind of like lounging in the living room. Mario and your other brothers are there. You see that Mario's going,"
"Mario: Look, I don't know what to tell you, all right? She knows. She knows what happened. She talked to me. She's in that same fakakta fucking, you know, monastery or whatever. She's learning karate or super karate, I don't know what it is. And…"
"Brennan: You can see that your mom is weeping in the kitchen. You see your dad goes,"
"Anthony: [lower voice than Mario, same accent] All right, so what? We was supposed to have the whole fucking family get put on Isabella's shit list 'cause we wouldn't fucking cooperate? Give me a fucking break. Dale was a piece of shit. He's dead. She'll get over it. She'll move on. I don't wanna fucking hear it."
Brennan: You see that your other brothers look around. Give me an Insight check as you're looking at them.
Emily: That's gonna be 15.
"Brennan: Okay. Your family's on a spectrum. The answer you're looking for is a sloppier one than maybe you would have wanted. And as you look at your family, you see very clearly that your mom is extremely distraught. Your dad is pretty remorseless. Your brothers kind of are falling somewhere in between. Most of what you can see on an Insight check looking at these people, looking at your family. And your family's had beef forever. You know, like there's been lots of times where like people weren't talking to somebody else or weren't getting along or other stuff like that. It looks like Mario was at least partially telling the truth in terms of them fully allowing this nightmare to happen and not telling you. But none of them making the call, pulling the trigger, or even suggesting that this be what happened."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: You see that your mother, Maria, turns around and says,"
"Maria: [higher voice, same accent, distraught] I don't understand why you gotta fucking talk about this in the house. You guys wanna have your business, you wanna go around and play fucking gangsta, that's great, why has it gotta happen in the living room? If you won't let me be a part of it, then why are you fucking talking about it in my house?"
"Brennan: You see Anthony turns around and goes,"
"Anthony: [yelling] Maria, look, you were the one that was the most upset out of all when fucking Dale showed up."
"Brennan: And she was like,"
"Maria: 'Cause I thought, I didn't know him. And I wanted Sofia to be happy!"
"Brennan: You see that Mario goes,"
"Mario: Jesus fucking Christ. All right, look, we got problems, all right? Isabella Infierno's fucking dead. That means that whatever favor we were doing for Don Confetti, now we just are back to owing him again. So, I don't know what the fuck we're gonna do, but we're back in his pockets."
"Brennan: You see that Anthony goes,"
"Anthony: Look, fucking Confetti is a stooge. He's a fucking puppet. We all know who the guy is calling the fucking shots. So, what he says is gonna go. And, you know, if we can just make it a little while longer, we're gonna be out of the fucking weeds on this one, all right?"
"Brennan: You see that Vincenzo looks over and goes,"
Vincenzo: [thicker voice] So should we set a place for Sofie for Christmas or what's the deal?
"Brennan: You see that Adriano looks over to him and says,"
"Adriano: [calmly] Of course, set a fucking place. What's your problem? Set a place. Who knows if she'll come, but set a fucking place."
"Brennan: You see that your mom, Maria, says,"
"Maria: You know what, I'm going out. I'm gonna make a lasagna. Anyone who wants to be nice and decent in the house can fucking have it when it's ready."
"Brennan: And you see that she puts on a big overcoat, slams the door, goes and begins to walk down the street out of the house. You see that your other brothers kind of all look sheepishly at each other. Your dad puts the volume on the game back up and the conversation dwindles."
"Emily: Okay. I retract my Unseen Servant. I'm deciding if I wanna do one more thing with my unseen servant before I meet up with, before I talk to Jackson. I look through my backpack, which is now my home."
"Brennan: [laughing, but also cringing a little] Oh."
"Emily: I even have a little air freshener in there and everything. It's very homey. I decide, I have all, I have my wedding pictures. And I send the Unseen Servant to burn my house down."
Siobhan: What? Jesus Christ.
"Brennan wiggles his hand like the wind, miming the Servant going there."
Emily: [shrugging unrepentantly] I'm gonna need money.
[Ally laughs in realization]
"Siobhan: Oh my god, you are from Staten Island."
[Brennan cackles]
Lou: Jesus.
"Emily: And then I go and I have a really loud, obvious conversation at the deli counter at a supermarket where I know that there's closed circuit TV so I have an alibi."
Murph: This is diabolical!
Emily: It's my house.
Ally: What is an obvious deli conversation?
"Brennan: You walk into a deli. You see a guy back there, he's like,"
"Deli Owner: hey, how's it going?"
Sofia: Hi. I'm looking for soppressata.
"Deli Owner: Yeah, how much you want?"
Sofia: You only got one? I'm kinda looking to sample a couple different flavors. I got the afternoon so...
Deli Owner: All right.
Sofia: I'm making a charcuterie for Christmas and I really wanna get it right.
"Brennan: You see, he takes a little piece of soppressata on a tiny little metal fork. You see like one of those ice cream-style like used fork things over it, a little metal can."
"Deli Owner: Here, you can try this."
Sofia: I put it in my mouth and I just suck on it for as long as I can.
"Brennan: He just stares at you, just grimly."
Sofia: Mm. Spicy.
"Brennan: Cool. You're there for a nice, long chunk of time until eventually you hear, we're gonna actually cut over to Ricky real quick. Ricky, what do you do the next morning when you wake up?"
Zac: I just really like protein-heavy breakfast.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Eggs and turkey bacon.
Ally: A rotisserie chicken.
"Zac: Some rotisserie chicken just kinda shredded and sprinkled onto that and one piece of toast. Then, just go for a jog. Just maybe going kinda close to the Financial District, see what I see."
"Brennan: Cool. You're heading close to the Financial District. You head off. As you're down there by the Financial District, you get all the way down to Battery Park, you look across the entire harbor and give me a Perception check."
Zac: I got a 21.
Brennan: [sniffs] You smell smoke coming from across the harbor.
Zac: I'm fucking dogging it.
"Brennan: In the freezing cold day, you run all the way to the edge of the dock and just out and [grunting] swim past the Statue of Liberty. You hear a bunch of people say,"
"Bystanders:[yelling] Sir, sir, get out of the water!"
Zac: I'm like cresting like a dolphin. [pretends to leap out of his chair]
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah. You are swimming strong enough,"
Lou: Jesus.
Brennan: You have now 20 Strength. Fully breaching the water with each stroke of your arms.
Emily: Are people taking pictures?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: Are people saying, to me, get out of the water?"
"Brennan: Yeah, exactly."
Zac: Oh okay.
Brennan: Yeah.
Bystander: Sir!
Brennan: Yeah.
Ricky: Someone needs me.
"Brennan: You arrive… At a certain point, you get to the other side and you see in a beam of light, Ox, wagging his tail on the other side of the harbor."
[panting]
Zac: Can I make a Perception check?
"Brennan: Yeah, make a Perception check."
"Zac: Okay, 25?"
"Brennan: It's Ox. He's back. He's come back and he's made of light. He says,"
"Ox: Ricky, Ricky, I was dead. But I came back to life now. You can never kill hope. Hope never dies."
Ricky: You can never kill it.
"Brennan: You see, poom, jump on the thing. Run over. You see, I don't think you've ever been to Sofia's home. But what you know of Sofia's home is here, burning in front of you."
"Zac: I save it, I have to save the stuff. I look for a hose."
"Brennan: Cool, you call 911."
Zac: Call 911. [sirens] Do the whole...
"Brennan: A bunch of firefighters show up and go,"
"Firefighter: Jesus Christ, you're soaking wet. The water is freezing to you."
Ricky: There's no time. The fire will warm me.
[Emily laughing]
Zac: I'm just like messing with like a little garden hose.
"Brennan: [rushing water] You help 'em put the fire out. Cool. Go ahead and give me a, just give me a raw Athletics check to try and put the fire out."
Zac: Come on. 20… 23.
Emily is truly losing it at this point.
"Brennan: Amazing. Incredible. The home is ruined, but you save it from collapsing. You stop the fire from spreading anywhere else. Go ahead and give me an Investigation check with advantage if you'd be so kind. You can make one for Ox as well."
"Zac: Okay. So, one for me and then one for Ox? Both at advantage or?"
"Brennan: Both at advantage 'cause you're investigating a fire, it's what you do."
"Zac: Okay, Investigation. So that's a 17. And that's way less. And then a 10. So, 17."
"Brennan: Ricky, you look around the burned out house. As you are, you see the firefighters come through and they say, you See some like New York One cameras pull up and one of them is outside going,"
"Reporter: You know, if it hadn't been for Ricky Matsui swimming from Manhattan to Staten Island in a record-breaking two and a half minutes, we just wouldn't have gotten here in time to stop the fire from spreading."
Ricky: Anyone could've done that. Anyone could've swam that.
Brennan: You see him hold the camera to you.
"Reporter: Wow, two fires put out in one month. Ricky, you don't even work in this borough."
"Ricky: Right. Well, I'm just doing what anyone would've done."
Reporter: Nobody would've swam from Manhattan to Staten Island. Nobody would've swam from Manhattan to Staten Island. That is bordering on superheroic. You are not wearing a jacket and ice is actively forming in your hair and I guess not on your skin 'cause it's completely hairless and just chiseled as stone like a statue.
Ricky: I'll get warmed up later. I'm gonna treat myself to just like a nice cocoa after this. What kind of camera is that?
"Reporter: Cut, cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it."
"Brennan: Investigating the house with Ox, you look around. You see a lot of photos are missing, but there are some family photos still here. And you see Sofia. You're like, this is Sofia's house. And as you're here, you see like in the closet and some places that there are big like empty swathes as though somebody like packed to leave this place."
"Zac: I just text Sofia a picture of just a selfie, me in her burned down house, but also going… Like. [makes a confused face, with his hand on his chin]"
"Brennan: Sofia, on the way to Jackson's, you get that text."
Sofia: Oh my god. What happened?
Ricky: Seems like someone packed up your stuff and then tried to burn down your house?
"Emily: I text him and I'm like,"
"Sofia: Truthfully, I left my house. I wasn't planning on being there for the holidays. So, I don't know what happened. But we'll talk in person."
Ricky: Okay.
Brennan: Wonderful. So.
Zac: Truly.
Murph: Insurance fraud.
"Ally: Committed full insurance fraud. “Truthfully, I don't know what happened.”"
"Brennan: You're on the way to the monastery. Kugrash, we cut over to you. You wake up in your lovely dog bed. You see Wally comes out and he goes,"
"Wally: Morning, Dad, how's it going?"
"Kugrash: Hey, boy, Wally, how you doing this morning?"
Wally: I made breakfast.
"Kugrash: This is fucking awesome, I live in a house now."
Brennan: You see that it's just a bunch of string cheese on a plate.
"Kugrash: Yeah, hell yeah, man. Absolutely."
Zac: Like cut up.
"Brennan: Yeah, finely cut up, chopped. And then they got cooked hot dogs, so it's just hot little cylinders. It's cooked hot dog and little bits of string cheese."
Kugrash: You're the fucking sweetest boy. I didn't even hear you do that.
"Wally: Oh, string dog, yeah."
"Kugrash: Yeah, string dogs. Are you eating string dogs too, Wally?"
"Wally: Yeah, this is for me. That's what I eat."
Kugrash: This is what you eat every morning?
Wally: Every morning for breakfast.
"Kugrash: That's insane, Wally."
"Wally: I don't get a whole lot of what cooking is, but I know that you can put a hot dog in a microwave. But you shouldn't put tinfoil in there."
"Kugrash: No, you shouldn't."
"Wally: Nope, no way."
"Kugrash: Wally, you wanna watch Christmas movies today?"
Wally: [crying] Yeah. Can we watch the best Christmas movie of all time?
Kugrash: What is that?
"Wally: Freaking ""Die Hard"", dude."
"Kugrash: Hell yeah, man."
Wally: I love John McClane because he loves his wife.
Kugrash: Yeah.
Wally: He just wants to be with her.
"Kugrash: Yeah. What year did ""Die Hard"" come out? I'm trying to remember if I've seen ""Die Hard"" or not. I've been a rat for a long time."
"Brennan: ""Die Hard"" came out in the 80s, so you saw ""Die Hard"" right before."
"Kugrash: Oh, dude, ""Die Hard"" is the last movie I've seen, man. I'll watch it again."
"Brennan: Cool. You guys sit on his couch, eating hot dogs and string cheese and watching ""Die Hard"". It gets to the end—"
"Kugrash: This fucking rules, Wally."
"Brennan: He goes there and he goes,"
"Wally: Well, John McClane's so smart, he duct taped that gun to his back."
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Wally: I like it, you know, I love the movie, even with the swear words in it."
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Wally: Yeah, it's great. [sighs] Poor Professor Snape. He falls down at the end."
"Kugrash: Yeah, well he's a bad guy in this movie."
Wally: What?
"Kugrash: Yeah. You watched the movie right, Wally?"
Wally: I like the part where he jumped across the window. But I hate it when he gets the glass in his foot.
"Kugrash: Yeah, that's tough, man."
"Wally: I would hate that. You're supposed to wear shoes all the time. I went barefoot into the subways one time and they yelled at me. They said, you gotta wear shoes."
"Kugrash: Yeah. You're a tough guy though, Wally. Being able to walk around in the subway barefoot."
"Wally: Yeah, well it did hurt my feet real bad, 'cause I forgot, but never again, so. That's me. I make a mistake one time and I get yelled at and then I don't do it again."
"Kugrash: That's good, that's good."
"Wally: Well, you want to watch ""Die Hard"" again?"
"Kugrash: Why don't we watch, is there a newer Christmas movie? I haven't watched movies in a long time. I've been living in a tunnel."
"Wally: Yeah, there's a bunch of other ""Die Hards""."
"Kugrash: Yeah, let's watch ""Die Hard 2""."
"Brennan: He puts on ""Die Hard 2"". You guys just spend the day watching movies."
"Kugrash: Wally, what are your plans for the holidays? What are you..."
"Wally: Oh. Well. Normally, what I do is I do a little Christmas Eve here by myself,"
Kugrash: Okay.
"Wally: But then I go out on Christmas Day over to Forest Hills and I have like a lunch, or an early Christmas dinner with David. David needs to know about you, Dad."
"Kugrash: I don't know if David would be super happy about this, Wally. 'Cause you know David. He's kind of a ball-buster, right?"
Wally stares uncomprehendingly.
Kugrash: He might be mad about this.
Wally: Why?
"Kugrash: Well, you're a little kinder than… David has… You know how I did bad things and David's mad at me about it?"
Wally: Yeah.
Kugrash: I think it might kinda ruin his Christmas if he saw me.
Wally: But what about the rest of your family and everybody?
"Kugrash: Okay. Wally, how about this? Christmas Eve, me and you, we watch ""Die Hard 3"". Assuming there's a ""Die Hard 3""."
Wally: Yeah!
"Kugrash: We'll watch ""Die Hard 3"" me and you. Christmas,"
Murph: And then I turn into a dog.
Wally: Aw!
"Kugrash: Yeah, we go to David's like this and we have a little secret, all right? This is a game, all right? This is ""Die Hard"". Fucking secret mission, you and I are fucking partner cops, okay? The secret is we pretend—"
Wally: Are you a different person or are you—
"Murph: I come back to be, okay, I come back to being a rat."
Kugrash: I am a rat.
Wally: Okay.
"Kugrash: I am your dad, the rat. I can also turn into other animals. Just like twice a day though. I know that's kinda confusing. We're gonna go to David's. I'm gonna be a dog. I'm your new dog that you just adopted, okay?"
Wally: So where's my dad?
Kugrash: I'm your dad.
Wally: Okay.
Kugrash: Yeah. But you know how I turned into a rat?
"Wally: Oh, we're gonna tell a lie."
Kugrash: Yes.
Wally: On Christmas.
"Kugrash: Sometimes, Wally, yeah, sometimes you gotta tell lies to not ruin Christmas."
Wally: Okay.
"Kugrash: Your brother doesn't like me very much, Wally."
"Wally: How about this? I'm not good at lying so I'll show up, you tell 'em you're my dog, and then that way everybody has a merry Christmas."
"Kugrash: I will have someone else show up and say that I'm your dog. This is convoluted. I have a feeling it's gonna blow up in our face. Yeah, yeah, we'll do that."
Wally: Okay.
Kugrash: Fuck me.
Wally: Merry Christmas.
Kugrash: Fuck me.
Wally: I like in this part because Scar is in this movie.
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Wally: From ""The Lion King""."
"Kugrash: Oh yeah, yeah. Oh, what is ""The Lion King""?"
Wally: Oh my god!
Brennan: And he rushes over. You have a wonderful day watching movies with Wally.
[cast laughs]
Murph: So fucked.
"Brennan: Cool. Pete, you get over to 53V3N's place. He's got like a bunch of servers at his place. He's got like a big sort of like refrigerated computer room. This is sort of like a weird, you know, like tech-bro, multi-level penthouse apartment. He looks around he goes,"
"53V3N: All right. Pete, good to see you, my man."
Pete: Good to see you too.
"53V3N: : So let's go ahead and re-up, shall we?"
"Pete: Yeah, let's do it."
Brennan: He starts counting his stuff up for you. Make a Arcana check for me.
Ally: Eh. 12.
"Brennan: 12, cool. He starts like parceling out the drugs for you. And you start to sense coming into the Vox Phantasma powers, you sense that there are like trace bits of stuff that you could detect on these different drugs if you wanted to."
"Ally: Oo yeah, could I roll for like Insight or—"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can roll for Insight and you can roll with advan… If you wanna like cast Detect Magic or something you can totally roll with advantage as well."
"Ally: Yes, that’s exactly what I want to do. Yeah, great."
Siobhan: Oh.
Murph: Not good.
Ally: 6.
Brennan: 6 is the highest you get?
Ally: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah, he does some drugs out for you, puts them in your bag. He goes,"
"53V3N: Great. You're looking good, man. Have you been like working out or something?"
"Pete: Yeah, I actually have, thanks for noticing. What about you? Who are you working with now? What's going on with everything?"
"Brennan: He's like, well, he's like,"
"53V3N: First of all, that $800 is now $812, thank you, Bitcoin."
"Pete: Oh great, man, yeah. It's a great thing you bought 1/29 of one of those."
"53V3N: Yeah, 1/29 of a bitcoin."
Pete: Mm-hmm. That's great.
"53V3N: And then you fold that. And then you fold that, and eventually you get to one full bitcoin."
Pete: Cool.
"53V3N: You're with me on this, right?"
"Pete: Yeah, man, look yeah, maybe one day I'll buy like Ethereum or fucking whatever you're always telling me about."
"53V3N: It's about diversity, right? Because again, it's layers upon layers, right? It's systems that exist on top of each other."
Pete: Cool.
"53V3N: And if you're not calculating how these systems interact, you know, you're playing chess two-dimensionally when you need to be playing it three- dimensionally, and honestly four-dimensionally if you can."
Pete: Great.
53V3N: Cool.
Pete: Cool.
53V3N: Yeah.
"Pete: Yeah, maybe I'll take two hours and set up a wallet for myself one day."
53V3N: Are you doing a bit or are you being serious?
"Pete: I'm not doing a bit, I'm not. Maybe I will set aside a whole afternoon and get myself a bitcoin."
53V3N: Is this new ink on your fingers by the way?
Pete: Yeah.
"53V3N: Okay. 'Cause that does draw attention, right? 'Cause we're trying to not fit the profile. You know what I mean?"
"Pete: Look, everyone has tattoos now, man. Look around. Our age group..."
53V3N: I don't have tattoos.
Pete: It's weird for someone in our age group not to have tattoos. Think about that.
"53V3N: That tattoos are an archaic, inefficient form of bio-hacking. Tell you what I do have, I have a dopamine receptor lodged in here, right? And I have an IV that goes to my Soylent drip."
Pete: That's great. That's great.
53V3N: I don't need to eat. Do you know how much I save on dentist bills by not having to eat?
"Pete: I don't, man. Look, you did it, you hacked the system. You won and this is what winning looks like."
"Brennan:: He's in a giant, buzzing dark room full of servers."
"53V3N: I know, dude, I won."
Pete: That's so sick.
"[rushing computer fans, beeping]"
53V3N: This is winning. This is the American dream right here. I'm in a dark room full of servers and I am getting rich.
"Pete: Wow. That's so sick. Hey, you know what, I was gonna ask you, I was asking everybody, but have you ever talked to anyone named Bob Moses? You know that guy? He's like a business dude."
"Brennan: He says,"
"53V3N: Bob Moses. Yeah, he's like, yeah that name's a little bit familiar. I had to rework some stuff 'cause one of our groups got snagged. Some of where we were recollecting the heroin from got snagged. There was a bunch of, he's like, he goes like, yeah, he's like, this is the problem with trying to do business with like backwards countries, 'cause a lot of the people that were doing those fucking, that were growing the heroin for us, they were like trying to smuggle some people out of the country, stupidly, and they got caught and a bunch of them got killed."
Pete: Fuck.
"53V3N: But that's not our problem, right?"
"Pete: Nightmare. Okay, yeah. So, then you met Bob Moses that way?"
53V3N: No. That name got floated to me through somebody 'cause now we have a different connect with the people that we're getting coke from. So...
Ally: Can I roll Investigate on him?
Brennan: You wanna do Insight?
"Ally: Or Insight, yeah."
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Ally: Fucking come on, man. 9."
Brennan: He seems to be telling the truth.
"Ally: All right, cool cool."
"Brennan: He's like, oh he's like, but he's like, very peripheral."
53V3N: I heard that name. That name got floated on like one of the forums I'm on.
Pete: He's a big coke guy.
53V3N: Really?
"Brennan: And he starts to scan through some stuff on his computer. He's like,"
53V3N: Should I be worried about this dude? Is he trying to muscle in?
"Pete: I don't think so. No, I think he runs a completely different game that we have nothing to do with, but—"
53V3N: What kind of game?
Pete: He does a lot of weird stuff with young people.
"53V3N: Hey, young people is our market. Young people are our market."
"Pete: Yeah, true."
"53V3N: You do sell to high schoolers, right?"
"Pete: Yeah, man. Unfortunately, I do."
Brennan: What's going on with Pete as he's like saying this stuff?
"Ally: I'm really starting to see my life through a new lens now that I'm sober. I'm like,"
"Pete: Yeah, man, I fucking sell to a lot of high schoolers. But they're rich. Anyway, no..."
"53V3N: And you're not just selling them weed, right? 'Cause I know they're gonna want weed, but you can push the pills. You can push the heroin, you can push the coke, you can push all that stuff."
Ally: I disassociate fully.
"Pete: Cool, man, cool cool cool, yeah."
"53V3N: Okay, great. So, focusing back in. If you want me to look out for this guy, I can see what I can find on the web."
"Pete: Yeah, I would love it. Please, please, please."
53V3N: Okay.
Pete: Use your databases and stuff like that. I would love it.
53V3N: What do you think a database is?
Pete: JSTOR.
"53V3N: Okay. I'm gonna take care of this. Keep on the lookout, you're strapping, right, you got heat?"
Pete: I always got heat.
"53V3N: Okay, good. He's like, because remember, tech is tech, right? 'Cause we can hack here on the computer and we can hack in real life."
Brennan: And he takes a full golden AK-47 out from under his desk.
"Pete: God, man, it's insane that you don't have an Instagram. Can I just say? Your whole thing would go crazy."
"53V3N: Oh yeah, let me get an Instagram. Hey, why don't I just email the FBI?"
Pete: I don't want another— where you saw that I used my fingerprint on my phone. I don’t want another argument.
53V3N: [yelling] Social media is voluntary panopticon.
"Pete: Okay, thank you, thank you, 53V3N."
53V3N: Okay.
"Brennan: Click click click. He gets back on the computer. Cool. You leave 53V3N's place, possibly rattled by some of the--"
"Ally: Yeah, I'm really like, high schoolers."
"Brennan: And you dip back out. Sofia, you make your way over to, I assume you're going to the monastery, right?"
Emily: Yeah. I'm meeting up with Jackson.
Brennan: You meet up with Jackson. You go up the never-ending fire escape and arrive at the monastery in the clouds where everything is sidewalk.
Emily: I have my backpack.
"Brennan: You see Jackson who has mostly been like commanding you to like carry stuff and punch stuff and jump over stuff. You see that he's waiting at the gates of the monastery up on the cloud. And you see he's got a blanket and a pillow under his arm and a towel. And as you go up, you've only been working with him for a few days. He wordlessly, as you get to the top, moves in, and puts you in that hug that gets like very still the moment that—"
Emily: I think I just dead fish it 'cause I don't know how to take it right now.
"Brennan: He leaves there for a second. He pulls back and you see he's got tear lines on his face but is otherwise completely stone and he goes,"
"Jackson: Come on, we got a room set up."
Sofia: How'd you know?
Jackson: It's my business to know.
Sofia: I was planning on just like leaving the island.
Jackson: We're not technically on Staten Island anymore.
Sofia: Where are we?
"Jackson: Well, I think about two miles up. The zoning changes."
"Sofia: Oh. Okay, good enough for me. Yeah, I'll take that room. It's better than living out of my backpack."
Emily: I empty my backpack.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see that he takes you to like a little room in the monastery and it's very spartan. You know, the walls, ceiling, and floor are all sidewalk. There's a thin little mattress, some blankets. He has like the blanket in it but it has like sheets on it already. There's like a little wash basin and a place to put some of your stuff and that's about it."
"Emily: Yeah. I mean, I take out, I have three pairs of black pants, three pairs of black shirts. I fold 'em. Get some water on my face."
"Brennan: You see he says… He gives you a moment to like settle yourself up. When you come back out of the hallway, he looks at you and says,"
Jackson: Uh. Follow me.
Sofia: Okay.
"Brennan: He goes with you to Brooklyn. And he stops at a little, you see he's got like a little Mets windbreaker on and little Mets hat. Stops at a little bodega. You look inside and see La Gran Gata sort of peer out at you from the bodega and sort of."
"Sofia blows a kiss to La Gran Gata, who purrs gently at her."
"Brennan: And you see that he goes to buy some flowers. And he sort of looks over to you and says,"
"Jackson: If you wanna grab something, it's on me."
Emily: Okay. I grab a Sky Bar.
"Brennan: Oh, you grab a Sky Bar. He says,"
Jackson: You wanna get some flowers too?
Sofia: Are we going to a graveyard?
Jackson nods.
Sofia: Are we going to whose grave I think that we're going to?
Jackson nods again.
Emily: Okay. I grab another Sky Bar. He loved Sky Bars.
"Brennan: You see, he goes,"
"Jackson: Yeah, that kid was a freak for Sky Bars."
"Brennan: You guys end up at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. It's a cemetery so massive that, as you walk into the middle of it, the city actually fades away and you're just looking at the green hills, the old moss, and lichen- covered tombstones. Trees, it's beautiful here. You walk up, see that Jackson, who again, doesn't wear sadness in his body really. He's just like the most solid guy. Puts, you know has like this like chalk and dust-covered hands and puts the flowers down at the grave. And looks up at you and respectfully walks a little distance away over like to a nearby tree and kind of leans against it, facing a little bit away from you and starts smoking a cigarette."
Emily: Oh my god. Well. I think I'm just gonna unwrap one of the Sky Bars and kinda mush it into the ground. [laughing] And then eat my Sky Bar.
Lou sighs gustily.
Brennan: Incredible.
"Emily: And I'm just gonna, think I'm not, I'm just gonna say,"
"Sofia: Dale, I'm not ready for words. But I did burn down the home that we made together. So, I guess that's just kind of like today's bulletin."
Emily: [laughing] And then I silently eat my bar.
Murph: You have had an insane day.
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Big day. Yeah, you look at this point like--"
Emily: I'm also on day one of mourning my husband's death now.
"Murph: Yes, yes, yes."
"Brennan: After a few minutes, you finish your Sky Bar. Jackson chooses this moment to come back over. He goes..."
"Sofia: He was a good student? He was one of your students, right?"
Jackson: Second only to Method Man. He was one of the best.
"Sofia: I can't believe I never knew that about him. I wish I had had time to be mad at him for not telling me that, about this other secret life."
"Brennan: He looks at you and goes,"
"Jackson: I mean, you can talk to Kingston about the dangers of bringing a loved one into the Unsleeping City. It doesn't solve all your problems. And I know that it's easy to resent, but you gotta know that neither of those choices is pretty."
"Sofia: Yeah. No, I get it. But does this mean that I didn't know him as well as I thought I did?"
"Jackson: No. No. Look, Dale Lee was [sighs] one of the finest monks we've ever had in the Order of the Concrete Fist. And more than that, a decent man. He was good to his heart. He was a good kid. You knew the real Dale Lee. He was, yeah, I mean, could he break stone with his fists and jump into the sky and bust the buttons off of his short sleeve button-up? Yeah, he could do it."
Sofia: Oh my god. That sounds so hot.
"Jackson: He was a good-looking man. I'm not gonna sit here and… Look, I'm secure enough in myself, he was a good-looking guy."
"Sofia: Yeah, he was very attractive."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Jackson: But he was the guy you knew. He was a fucking dork. The guy was a mild-mannered accountant through and through. I have never seen him more excited than when I told him that the monastery wasn't affiliated as a religious organization. He went through the roof. He went through years of our taxes and got us, I mean, he got the whole mess hall. And the reason we got those new steam tables, that's 'cause he came in and he did that for us."
Sofia: Of course he did. [sighs]
"Jackson: He was, you know, he was a piece of work. Kind to a fault. I mean, yeah, was he a little bit of a goober? Yeah, I mean he gave me a frigging Visa gift card when he graduated."
"Sofia: All right, well this is my husband we're talking about so I don't wanna have to Hellish Rebuke you."
Jackson: No. I'll back off.
Sofia: Okay.
"Brennan: He goes like, he says,"
"Jackson: Dale was a… Dale was, you know, in the way that… No, I've had lots of students and I treasure all of them. Dale was like family."
Sofia: Yeah.
Jackson: And I'm so sorry for your loss.
"Sofia: It's okay. It's just weird because I grieved it one way and now I'm grieving it through a different scope. But it's fine. I'm glad that I now can kinda use this opportunity to get to know this whole other side of him that I didn't know. So, that's nice. I do have one square on my Sky Bar left. Did you want some? I'm so sorry I was rude, I didn't offer any."
"Jackson: Yeah, let me get a hit of that. That'd be great."
"Sofia: Okay, yeah."
"Brennan: You see he takes it and chews on it. He's like,"
Jackson: Do you need more time or you wanna start heading back?
"Sofia: Nah, let's head back."
"Brennan: You guys start to walk out of the cemetery. You see, he goes,"
"Jackson: Yeah. There was a time where we thought Dale was gonna be the, I don't know, it doesn't matter."
"Sofia: The what? No, of course it matters. I wanna hear any story about him at this point, obviously."
"Brennan: He goes back with you and he says, as you guys go from Green-Wood, you get back to Battery Park and as you're crossing the ferry, you're just taking the ferry, you're both like looking over the Statue of Liberty as you pass by it going back to Staten Island. You see he goes,"
[somber piano music]
"Jackson: [sighs] The Order of the Concrete Fist was founded early in the history of New York City. And our roots go all the way back to ancient masters, the Shaolin Temple, the forms we practice here were developed for the role that New York plays in the magical cosmology, not only of America, but the world. Our mantra is, at its root, and we have several, but the most significant and most important one is it is what it is."
"Sofia: I know, sometimes I hear that in my head."
"Jackson: This place,"
"Brennan: And you can see the Statue of Liberty raising her lamp as you pass by,"
"Jackson: Is a doorway, for so many people, to the American dream. And so many people came here with that dream in their heart. And the relationship of this city to all of what this larger country means has always been about… You know, America's about dreams. And I don't say that lovingly. I mean, there's a certain degree of this place that's based on delusion and imagery and, you know. I'm gonna make something of myself. I'm gonna be what no one said I can be. And you know, I'll pull myself up by my bootstraps. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps, that's fucking impossible. And that metaphor's lost on most people. New York and what the Order of the Concrete Fist represents, we're supposed to be the fly in that ointment. You understand? Things are not always what you want them to be. And they're not always what you dream that they are. Things are what they are. And it is what it is. And..."
"Sofia: Yeah, I guess I definitely feel that way these days."
"Jackson: In any case, what we represent, our role here in the city, is to be that reminder to a place that is often filled with lies and illusions. That eventually, the smoke and mirrors fades away and you hit the brick. That there is something real. And it needs to be acknowledged and respected. That's why we have often stood to protect this place against those things that would encroach from the Dream Realm. There are stories at the founding of the order, about a day when something would come through from the other side. And the order would fall unless the chosen one were to appear. That was supposed to be Dale."
"Sofia nods, looking devastated."
"Jackson: He found where the spirits congregate of our order that are supposed to impart powers of the chosen one. And when he got there, they weren't there. So, I don't know how much hope there is. But hey, [shrugs] it is what it is."
Emily: I crack a Corona. Actually a Coronita.
Ally: I was going to say a Coronita!
Emily: 'Cause I'm cutting back.
Ally: It's like this big. [holds their fingers about a hand’s width apart]
Sofia cracks her Coronita and takes a little sip.
"Brennan: Cool. So, anyone else on that day of the 21st up to any business before going to the clock gnomes of..."
Ally: I would love to lift with Ricky.
"Zac: Yeah. I… [laughs] Yeah, for my second workout of the day,"
Ally: Great.
Zac: I meet up with Peter.
"Ally: I went to the pool and everyone was really weird about the locker rooms and I was like, fuck, and then I texted you."
Zac: I was like typing up just like a workout schedule and some macro stuff for Pete.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: Oh, so you're doing some macro, you're doing some lifting. Hell yah, you guys get to the gym. Pete, go ahead and give me a Strength check and a Constitution check."
"Ally: Great, Strength. Is, where is Strength? Oh, there it is, 16."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Constitution.
Brennan: Constitution.
"Ally: Great, 10."
Brennan: 10.
Zac: Are these saving throws?
Brennan: These are saving throws.
Zac: Can you add your Charisma? My Charisma?
"Brennan: Oh yeah, so you beat, plus 3."
Zac: Plus 3.
Ally: 13.
"Brennan: So you see that Pete is starting to, you actually are getting the strength. The testosterone is doing its work."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: But you're like fading fast. And then Ricky, how does your aura manifest in this moment?"
"Ricky: Push it, push it. Push it. You got this, you got this."
Ricky has his hands on the chest bar while Pete lifts.
Ally: My hands are shaking so heavily.
"Ricky: I'm not helping, I’m not helping, I'm not even helping."
Pete: Aah!
Brennan: Incredible.
Ricky: Pain is weakliness leaving the body.
"Pete: Oh great, isn't that like the Army's slogan?"
"Ricky: Probably, I just heard it at cross country in middle school."
Pete: Oh cool. Middle school?
"Brennan: You guys work out that day. That night, Pete, you roll back Kingston. You have a lovely day back at work."
Lou: I'm sure.
"Brennan: You're feeling great, man. You see that that troll comes back over, face freshly covered with warts."
"Troll: Man, I'm telling you, it worked out great."
Kingston: Looks good.
"Troll: Thank you, man, appreciate it. This one's about to bust, so I'm looking good."
"Kingston: Okay. Hey, you let me know when that happens. Send me a picture. Take a, what do these kids tell you?"
"Troll: Oh yeah, my kids do the same. My kids, they're always running around at the bottom of the Hudson River, they're like snapping these selfie, I'm like—"
"Kingston: Yeah, send me one of them. Send me a Snapchat."
Troll: I'll do it. I try to do it on my computer that my kid set up a home computer for me. So I'll try to do it on that.
"Brennan: You get back to your apartment that night. Pete, you're back at Kingston's that way. You're like sore from lifting with Ricky that night."
Pete: Ow.
"Kingston: You good, Pete?"
"Pete: Yeah, I'm fine."
Kingston: Swimming take it outta you?
Pete: I didn't even swim. I went and worked out with Ricky.
Kingston: Ooh.
Pete: He's so strong.
Kingston: He's very strong.
Pete: It made me hate him.
"Kingston: I see that, I see that. Well, if you want some protein, I'll cook up some chicken."
Pete: I would love that.
"Kingston: Yeah, I mean, well I'm sure… You don't need more protein. Just take two Advil."
"Pete: Oh, you're right, great, great plan."
"Brennan: Hell yes. Cool. The next day, Misty, you're gonna head over to Grand Central, 'cause you've heard there might be a little bit of trouble. Would you contact anyone else to come with you or?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'd probably call Kingston."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: If he's available.
Brennan: Rad.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I feel like that makes the most sense for me to call, maybe Kingston calls other people, but..."
Brennan: Yeah.
Siobhan: Misty's old school.
"Lou: Yeah, I guess I'll,"
"Kingston: Hey, everybody. We're gonna run over. Supposedly some unhappy gnomes at Grand Central. I'll let you know if it's a bigger thing."
Misty: Breakfast's on me.
Kingston: Yes.
Misty: There's a Jones Coffee in there that does great espresso.
"Murph: At this point, I've watched ""Die Hard"" 10 times so I'm down to get out of the house."
Emily: I show up to any invitation.
"Murph: I'm coming, why not?"
"Brennan: Cool. So you head out that day. So yeah, you guys get to the big Grand Central food court. You're having, what's Misty treating everybody to in the food court there?"
"Siobhan: I'm sort of taking everybody on the grand tour. So I'm like, oh, this is the best thing at this place. You gotta get this particular type of sushi at the sushi place but then over at Junior's, you have to get like this very specific type of like, everything is off menu. Everything is just because I've lived there for so fucking long, I know exactly what is good at every—"
"Murph: Can I search through their trash to see what I eat? Yeah. Cool, that's a 15 on my Investigate."
Brennan: Hell yes. You find some great old crusty bagels.
Murph: Nice.
"Brennan: You also see, yeah. The sushi place throws out a lot of its fish that it's bad."
Kugrash: They throw out a lot of good stuff.
"Kingston: Kugrash, I will buy you a bagel. Do you want a bagel?"
"Kugrash: Ehh, you know, you..."
Sofia: He's got a bagel.
"Kugrash: Hey, Sofie, you want one?"
Misty: Don't eat that bagel.
"Sofia: No, actually, I'm good. I've made my own Long Island Iced Tea by putting a bunch of nips into a Nestea and just shaking it up."
"Zac: I feel really guilty but I'm like,"
Ricky: Today's gonna be my cheat day.
"Kingston: Wow, we get to watch Mr. March cheat. [claps] I love this!"
Sofia: I promise I won't put it on social media.
"Brennan: Misty, as you guys have all eaten, you walk through again that click- clack of stone. Beautiful here. You know how to contact the gnomes here. So you bring people over to the whispering gallery. Whispering gallery is, by the way, a real place in New York City which is an archway that you can whisper into one corner and someone standing in the other corner can hear you. So you know that this is how you contact the gnomes that live here."
"Siobhan: Okay, I go into the corner and say,"
Misty: Hey you gnomes.
"Brennan: Cling, plang, pang, pang."
[chiming Christmassy music]
Gnome: [coughs] Who the hell's on the other line?
"Misty: Darling, it's me, it's Misty."
"Gnome: Well, jeepers creepers, hold on one second."
[wheezing]
"Brennan: You see out from like a little storm vent there's like [wheezing] the vent opens up. And riding a little steam-powered motorcycle that has a coal engine, a like one and a half foot tall crazy old prospector with like the skinniest… He kind of moves like he has extra joints in his arms and legs. Takes these goggles that so everything else is soot-blasted but the eyes are clean. It's like glittering blue magical eyes. Very old, like bald. Little bandana. Kind of has like western clothes, like a little like weather vest and like tools. And he goes"
Gnome: [wheezes] As I live and breathe. Golly.
Brennan: Moves the soot around on his face with a sooty bandana.
"Bilbry: Misty Moore. I don't suppose you'd recognize me, but my name's Bilbry."
"Misty: Bilbry, how could I forget you? Bilbry, I've brought you a little packet of those nuts and bolts that you love."
"Bilbry: Oh my goodness, nuts and bolts."
Brennan: Smoke comes out of his mouth.
"Bilbry: Well, I'll be, welcome to Grand Central Station. You'll have to forgive me, I've been working on one of the dragons down in the secret train yard. Woo, they're ornery. Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello."
Pete: Hi.
"Sofia: Hi, I'm Sofia."
"Bilbry: Hi, Sofia, pleasure to meet you."
"Ricky: Are those any good, nuts and bolts?"
"Bilbry: Oh, for sure. But you'll ruin your human teeth on 'em. Crack 'em right open."
"Misty: It's his cheat day, he's eating anything he wants."
"Bilbry: Oh, if you wanna swallow some gently, I bet you could have some."
"Kugrash: Ricky, don't do it, just don't."
"Sofia: Ricky, you should cheat with a drink. Do you want a drink?"
"Ricky: I think I'd rather have a drink than a bolt or a nut, no offense."
Misty: We can go to the oyster bar afterwards and you can get a Manhattan that'll kill you.
Ricky: Sounds not safe.
"Kingston: My man, word on the street is not everything is great?"
"Bilbry: Oh yeah, we had a little bit of a tussle. Oh, Kingston Brown, great to see you, friend."
"Kingston: Nice to see you, Bill."
Bilbry: But are you coming by Willy's card game this week or no?
Kingston: I'm hoping to make time. I've been busy dealing with some things.
"Bilbry: I just know 'cause like the week before New Year's, some people are out of town and then--"
"Kingston: Well, I'll definitely be in town. So it'll just be a matter of me getting over to Brooklyn."
"Bilbry: Okay, I understand. It's a schlep for sure. If you need a ride on one of our magic trains, you just let me know."
"Kingston: I mean, when you say dragon, are you talking, is that a class?"
"Bilbry: Oh, let me show you what I've been working on! Quick, real quick, how are we gonna do this? All right, hold on."
Brennan: And you see that he starts to fold out this weird metal contraption that becomes a little 10 foot by 10 foot hex on the ground. It looks like hammered can tin that has like runes in it.
"Bilbry: If everybody would just care to go ahead and stop on here, that'd be great."
Emily: I jump in.
Murph: Cool.
"Misty: Bilbry, this work is exquisite. You are such a master craftsman."
"Bilbry: Well, flirting will get you everywhere. [winks]"
"Brennan: You see that he puts this thing on and goes. Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. And shrinks you all down into gnome size on this little platform."
"Kingston: I don't like this, my man."
Sofia: Do you have a scale? I'd love to weigh myself right now.
"Bilbry: Oh no, you couldn't… Well, what do you weigh normally? I would say, what, a buck 10?"
"Sofia: Oh my god, flirting will get you everywhere."
Bilbry: Hoo hoo hoo hee hee hee!
"Kingston: Hey, my man, how long are we gonna be like this?"
Murph: Is everyone my size now?
"Brennan: No, you're even smaller than normal."
"Kugrash: Oh shit. I was gonna start pushing people around. I was gonna physically bully you guys, shit."
Sofia: Your voice is a little bit higher too.
"Kugrash: [almost helium-esque] Hey, guys, fuck you."
Misty: My voice is exactly the same.
"Kugrash: Bill, you didn't need to shrink me, man. You didn't need to shrink me."
"Brennan: You see that he reaches down into the little vent he opened and takes a matchbox, like one of those big matchboxes. He inflates a little like, it looks like a newspaper hot air balloon made out of The New York Times."
"Bilbry: All aboard, here we go."
"Lou: How tall, we're like a foot and a half?"
"Brennan: No. At this point now, you guys are even smaller, where you can fit like standing in a matchbox together."
Lou: I hate this.
Zac: A matchbox?
Murph: This is cute.
Emily: Oh my god.
Bilbry: All aboard.
"Brennan: Hoot hoot. And the little thing begins to sail over Grand Central and you guys into the central hallway with all like the ticket things and the trains. You see the beautiful constellations overhead. The constellations all turn to wave at you. Go,"
"Constellations: Morning there, Bilbry."
"Bilbry: Morning there, fellas, how's it going?"
"Ally: I really wanna jump off and land on an oyster. That sounds like it would feel so good. I'm not going to, I just wanted to let you know."
"Emily: You're right, it would be like a slippery beanbag chair. Oh, the cushion."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: You guys see a number of little like zeppelins, hot air balloons, and biplanes are flying in a little circle…"
Lou: [fully losing it] Oh my God. [laughing]
"Brennan: ...around the central clock in the kiosk at the center of Grand Central. [buzzing] You see them flying around. You see that he looks out and you see that Bilbry takes, he sort of has his goggles on his head. You see he takes his goggles off and puts them over his heart as he looks at the clock at the center of Grand Central and goes,"
"Bilbry: There it is, the holy timepiece, the central clock. God bless it, look at it go. [sighs] I love you, clock. Love you with all my heart."
"Brennan: And [lips vibrating]. So you see that he takes you guys over to bum bum bum, hold on one second."
Lou: The amount of wonder in that moment was so much for my heart.
Emily: I know.
"Lou: My heart. Kingston is whatever, but my heart is so full right now."
"Siobhan: Already going into Grand Central Station, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world."
Ally: Totally.
Emily: Can we say that when I got shrunk that I had a nip in my pocket that didn't get shrunk so now I have a giant nip?
Siobhan: So now you are like Alice in Wonderland.
"Brennan: So you see that he takes you and he says,"
"Bilbry: All right, everyone hang on, we're heading into the Tempest."
"Brennan: And he flies the thing over. And you see that as you go towards the constellations, it turns into just real sky with storms around it."
"Bilbry: Ah, here we go."
"Brennan: And everybody make a Dexterity check for me, a Dexterity saving throw, if you'd be so kind."
Murph: Shit.
Ally: Nat 1.
Zac: Nat 3.
Siobhan: I also got a nat 1.
Emily: I got a 21.
"Zac: I got a 13. Oh no, 16. You add 3 to it for my Charisma save."
"Ally: Oh, thank you."
"Brennan: All right, you still both fail. You guys see that Misty and Pete are flung out of the matchbox."
"Emily: Oh my god, can I Mage Hand to help one of them?"
Brennan: Mage Hand is five pounds or less.
"Emily: Can I Mage Hand to grab one of them and,"
"Brennan: Uh, yes."
Emily: Safe landing onto an oyster.
Ally: Yes. Yes.
"Brennan: You [lips vibrating] Pete begins to, ah, fly down. So, Pete, you are totally cast aside and you go all the way to the food court and land on a giant, puffy oyster."
Ally: It's so slimy and it was way harder than I thought it was. There was no give. It was like landing on a muscle.
"Brennan: You see that someone grabs the oyster and without looking at it, begins to move it to their mouth."
[Pete yelling]
"Kingston: Bilbry, you need to turn this thing around."
Bilbry: We gotta wait for the wind storms.
"Murph: I turn into a giant eagle, I turn into a giant eagle."
Siobhan: I'm just gonna Misty Step back into the balloon.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: You land back in there.
Ally: I'm on the ground somewhere.
Brennan: You're back on the ground.
Emily: Can I Mage Hand to pick him back up?
"Brennan: You Mage Handed to slow his fall. Pete, you're fully back in the food court as you guys head through the storm—"
"Murph: Okay, giant eagle, I'll be a giant eagle."
"Brennan: Cool, you giant eagle to go… You fly back after Pete. Pete, give me a Dex save to jump out of the oyster."
"Ally: Oh, Jesus. Yeah, 7."
Lou: This is wild.
"Brennan: You stumble, fall. You take, I'm gonna say..."
Zac: What the fuck is happening?
Brennan: You take 6 points of falling damage as you land on the floor. And you see that someone's emotional support Jack Russell looks at you and goes [snarls].
"Pete: No. Bad dog, bad dog."
Brennan: It runs after you.
Ally: I take out my gun. I'm shooting this dog.
Emily: It’s so tiny.
Brennan: Open up on a dog.
Ally: Shooting this dog's leg.
"Brennan: You're shooting this dog in the leg, trying to take its knees out."
Ally: Fuck it.
"Brennan: We'll cut back to all of you guys. You soar through these clouds. You are flying after Pete. The rest of the four of you, and you see Bilbry says,"
Bilbry: He'll be fine.
"Ricky: My good sir, you should invest in some seat belts for this."
"Kingston: Bilbry, so you shrank us down without our consent, then you took, my man is back there. We gotta go back, Bilbry."
Bilbry: Behold the trainyards of the clock gnomes.
Misty: I'm having a great time.
Kingston: Okay.
Misty: This is a lark.
"Sofia: Yeah, I'm drinking from my giant nip. [hugging the nip] Happy Christmas."
Ally: Happy Christmas.
"Brennan: You guys arrive back at the… You guys see this incredible, extra- dimensional train yard appears that is kind of like, you see that spatial magic has wedged it into the space between the regular like Metro-North and Amtrak places. But you see that there's a bunch of animated trains that have like cars and compartments, but at the front of them are these like snarling, chrome-plated dragon heads. And they are like full size. You guys are back to your regular size here in the train yard. Kugrash, you giant eagle your way over to Pete. You arrive next to Pete who's shooting a dog."
"Kugrash: Don't shoot the fucking dog, Pete."
"Pete: Ah, an eagle! [shoots]"
"Kugrash: I'm not the one who is dying, goddammit. You see how dirty this eagle is? You think a regular eagle looks like this?"
Pete: Kugrash?
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Pete: Oh, okay, thank you."
"Ally: I ride you like ""The Rescuers Down Under""."
Kugrash: I've seen that movie. I've seen that movie. [sobbing] I took my fucking kids to see that.
"Pete: Are you crying? Am I riding a dirty, crying eagle? This is democracy now."
Kugrash: I'm such a goddamn bad dad.
"Brennan: You fly back through the storm, arrive back at the train yard. Poof, back to regular size. You see that Bilbry takes you and says,"
Bilbry: You guys wanna pet one of the dragons?
Sofia: Yes.
Pete: Yes.
Sofia: Absolutely.
Brennan: You guys can give me Animal Handling checks if you'd like.
"Ally: Oo yum. Okay, one good roll."
Lou: Let's go get bit.
Ally: 16.
Lou: 23.
Murph: 24.
Emily: 14.
Brennan: 24.
Zac: 10.
Siobhan: 16.
"Brennan: Kugrash and Kingston, you walk up, the rest of you guys, the dragons kind of [snarls]. But Kingston and Kugrash, you walk up to what looks like, you see that this train appears to be headed towards something called, this train has on the side of it, Clock Gnome Express. And the little like destination thing on the front of it says Realms of Shadow on it. You see that the dragon kind of [snarls] and calms down as you approach it. What do you guys do as you approach the dragon?"
"Kugrash: Hey, how you doing, buddy?"
Dragon: Hello.
Kugrash: Hey. I haven't met too many dragons before. Would you mind if I pet behind your ears or anything? Would that be enjoyable for you? All right.
The dragon train growls and nods.
Brennan: [train whistle] A big blast of steam comes out of its jaws.
"Kingston: This is a consensual working environment? Like you want this, right? I just wanna check."
"Dragon: [deep, rumbling] I was created."
Kingston: Oh.
"Dragon: So yes, I like this."
Kingston: Oh hell yeah. How fast you go?
Dragon: I can top out at 180.
Kingston: Damn.
"Kugrash: That's crazy, man."
"Dragon: Not bad. Really not bad. But that's for the express, you know. On the local tracks, we don't get up to that speed but..."
Kugrash: Where do you go to? Is this Shadow Express?
"Dragon: Yeah, well I do the Hudson Line. So it's Yonkers, Croton-Harmon, Peekskill, Spuyten Duyvil, Ossining, Tarrytown, and then Shadow Realms."
"Kingston: Oh, okay."
Kugrash: Right.
Kingston: Which Shadow Realms?
"Dragon: Oh, Cold Spring."
"Kingston: Oh, okay. Never been."
Kugrash: You guys got some problems going on down here?
"Brennan: You see that Bill, the dragon sort of looks confused, but Bilbry says,"
"Bilbry: Yeah, if you’re interested in taking a look at the problem, I can take you over."
Brennan: Bilbry walks—
"Kingston: Sorry. The dragon, what's your name, man?"
Dragon: What?
Kingston: What's your name? You got a name?
Centifax: My name is Centifax.
"Kingston: All right, C, I'll see you later, man."
"Centifax: All right, take it easy, Kingston Brown."
Kingston: That dragon knew my name!
"Misty: Wow, I've never seen Kingston starstruck before."
"Kingston: I mean, it doesn't happen of… I've never been inside of this place before. This is pretty nice."
"Brennan: You guys arrive. You see that there is this weird, little gyroscoping what looks like a tower of a multi-part cuckoo clock that is gyrating in different direc… So it's like concentric rings of a stacked cuckoo clock that spin in opposite directions from each other."
[music box version of “The First Noel” plays]
"Brennan: This one has been like very festively decorated for the holidays and you see that Bilbry leads you through, there's a bunch of other gnomes here. You're all regular-sized at this point. You guys are kind of crouched to enter some of the rooms and hallways. He brings you to this kind of central almost like chapel to clocks and clockwork things. And he says,"
Bilbry: High Priestess Hib-Hob. Are you around here somewhere?
"Brennan: You see that this old-looking woman appears. She is a clock gnome. You see that she's got a couple like warts that have some whiskers on them, but this very round, cute face. She's not only got the goggles on her head, but she's got glasses on at the same time that have those like little swiveling monocle lenses on them. She turns around. She's got like a big kind of like peasant's gown and smock on. Big leather work gloves. She turns around and goes [chuckles]"
"Hib-Hob: [sounds like Mickey Mouse] Well, hello there. Welcome, one and all. I am the High Priestess Hib-Hob. Thanks for coming by. Bilbry, what's the occasion? Oh my goodness, Misty Moore. Hello."
"Misty: Oh hello, happy holiday."
Hib-Hob: Huge fan. When are you gonna release a Christmas album? That's what I wanna know.
"Misty: You know what, I've been talking about it. I've been thinking about it."
"Brennan: You see that Bilbry says,"
"Bilbry: Well, these fine folks are here to talk about the trouble that happened."
"Hib-Hob: Well, very well. So, well, we had a little bit of a snafu. I had a little bit of a fainting spell here in the chapel the other day. And one of my most prized holy books is gone."
Ricky: You had a fainting spell?
"Hib-Hob: Yeah, never happens usually but—"
Sofia: Are you recently vegetarian?
"Hib-Hob: No, no. I eat mechanical parts like most clock gnomes."
Kingston: Are you drinking enough water?
Misty: Or oil? Are you drinking enough oil?
"Hib-Hob: I’ve heard eight thimblefuls a day, but that can't be true. That's way too much oil."
"Kingston: No, there's no such thing as too much oil if you are a clock gnome, all right?"
Hib-Hob: Okay.
"Ricky: Wait, someone took something?"
"Hib-Hob: Yes, yes."
Sofia: Spellbook.
"Hib-Hob: Well, one of our ancient religious books, the Big Book of Bits and Bobbins. It's missing."
Ricky: [nodding confidently] Sounds normal.
Kugrash: What was in that?
Sofia: I think I read that in college.
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Hib-Hob: I would very much doubt it. Well, the Big Boots— The Big Book of Bits and Bobbins, it's hard to say."
Misty: What was that? Say it again.
"Hib-Hob: The Big Book, sorry. The Big— [clears throat]."
Pete: What was it?
Hib-Hob: The Big Book of Bic...
Ricky: The Big Book of Bits and Bobbins?
"Kugrash: They're a proud people, all right? Some of us can't be humans. Goddammit. Respect the gnomes."
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Hib-Hob: So the, Bug, the Book, the.."
Brennan sighs exasperatedly and recenters himself.
Hib-Hob: Big Book of Bits and Bobbins went missing very recently.
Sofia: What if we just call it the Four B's? Would that be easier?
"Hib-Hob: Well no, we should respect it, it's a religious relic."
Sofia: Okay.
"Hib-Hob: So, the Big Book of Bits and Bobbins went missing."
Misty: And what is in the book?
"Hib-Hob: Well, like most of our religious books, it's a bunch of schematics and diagrams for building religious relics."
Misty: What kind of religious relics?
"Hib-Hob: Oh, the Big Book of Bits and Bobbins has some of the most important religious relics that we have. Very many important timepieces. Watches, clocks, pendulums."
Sofia: What about keys? Could you possibly like fake a key to the city or something like that?
"Hib-Hob: Sure. Well, there's plenty of locks and keys and all sorts of things like that—"
"Kugrash: Yeah, locks."
Sofia: Locks.
Siobhan: Can I do a History check or an Arcana check or something?
"Brennan: Yeah, give me an Arcana check if you want."
"Ally: Yeah, I'll do one too."
Kugrash: Door doesn't have a lock.
Siobhan: 17.
Ally: 14.
Kingston: Make a lock for one.
Kugrash: And it needs one.
"Misty: Right, but it doesn't have a lock right now."
Kugrash: Yeah. That's what they're trying to do.
Sofia: They're trying to build a lock. Maybe.
"Brennan: You see that the High Priestess goes,"
"Hib-Hob: Well, yes. There's a lot that you could do there that probably…"
"Brennan: Sorry, did anyone beat a 20 on an Arcana or no?"
Emily: Oh.
Lou: I'll try.
"Emily: I'll just try, why not?"
Lou: I got a nat 20.
Siobhan: What?
Ally: Yes.
Brennan: Nat 20.
Ally: Yes.
"[ uiet, dark orchestral music]"
"Brennan: Kingston. You've never been here before, but way back in the day when you first got the Eternal Token from the Dragon of Bleecker Street, and probably thinking about it 'cause you just met a dragon again, they're pretty rare in the city, the Dragon of Bleecker Street had a massive hoard of treasure and one of its, back when it was still around, one of its most prized possessions was this glittering, sparkling gem, a perfect cut gem from the clock gnomes, it was called a Time Stone."
Lou: Mm.
Ally: Mm.
Brennan: And the dragon knew that it was a object of incredible power.
Lou: Mm-hmm.
"Hib-Hob: Well yeah, most of our most important relics are in there, some relics that I dare not even mention out loud."
Kingston: What about the Time Stone?
Hib-Hob: How do you know about Time Stones?
Kingston: I have a— I had a very special relationship with the Dragon of Bleecker Street.
Hib-Hob: Holy…
Brennan: You see she takes her little gnome hat off.
Kingston: That's very kind of you.
Pete: What happened to the Dragon of Bleecker Street?
"Hib-Hob: The Dragon of Bleecker Street protected us time and time again from the chuds and troglodytes and all manner of things that tried to destroy our people and our little village here. We made that Time Stone for the dragon. It's one of only, I think, yeah, that's the last one we made and the others are all either gone or safe or here with us, protected."
"Sofia: I don’t, oh."
Kugrash: What do they do?
"Hib-Hob: A Time Stone doesn't really do too much by itself. It is an… If you were to get that book back, it goes into more detail. There's a lot of things to know about Time Stones, more than I can say right here. But suffice it to say that they are objects that draw on the power of time, and specifically gain power. They are aligned with certain times. And the—"
"Sofia: Oh, like solstice."
Hib-Hob: Like a solstice.
Sofia: Like tonight.
"Hib-Hob: Or midnight, the witching hour. Or something like that."
Pete: And this happened to you last night?
Hib-Hob: Yes.
"Pete: Hm, during the solstice."
Lou: Can I do a Medicine check on the gnome to see if there's anything like to see if—
Ally: If something happened.
Lou: Yeah. If I think something was put on them versus their actual state of being.
"Brennan: Yeah, give me a Medicine check."
Lou: All right. It's gonna be a 25.
"Brennan: So, Kingston, you walk over. You see, she looks up."
"Kingston: Miss, do you mind real quick, I'm a nurse, and so I just wanna take a look at you, see why you maybe fainted last night."
"Hib-Hob: Oh, certainly. Probably, yeah, probably dumb of me not to have gotten it checked out. I know you can't sleep with a concussion. But yeah, if you wanna take a look."
Kingston: Yeah.
Brennan: You check this here. High Priestess Hib-Hob was the victim of a very powerful Sleep spell.
Lou: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: That basically put her out. And you think it seems like it was probably pixie magic.
"Siobhan: [whispering] Ah, those fucking pixies."
Lou: All right. Great.
Hib-Hob: Am I okay? Is there a bump back there or--
"Kingston: You're gonna be just fine. Just make sure, I know it sounds hard, eight thimblefuls of oil is possible."
"Brennan: You see Bilbry nods sagely as you say that and pours a little thimbleful of oil and she goes,"
"Hib-Hob: All right. Well, I had one. I guess I've only had coffee today."
Kingston: There you go.
"Sofia: Don't vegetables have oil in them too, though? So like can't you get some of your oil from vegetables?"
Kingston: Very specific magical vegetables do have oil in them.
"Misty: Also avocados, avocados are great for clock gnomes."
"Kugrash: Have you had any weird, have you had any other visitors here recently that aren't just gnomes?"
"Pete: Yeah, it was a pretty big schlep to get in here, so..."
Kugrash: Have you had anybody else come through?
"Brennan: You see, she says—"
Ricky: Oh. Were there any pigeons in here?
"Hib-Hob: Oh, there's always some pigeons in Grand Central. But no, here, I'd have a hard time thinking so. You know, nobody would be able to get in here unless they were able to get through the storm somehow."
Sofia: But there have been pigeons in here though?
"Hib-Hob: Sure, some pigeons have gotten through the storm. The storm might not be that hard to get through."
Misty: Is the storm magically protective or just physically protective?
Hib-Hob: Just physically.
"Misty: Okay. So you could teleport through it, perhaps."
"Hib-Hob: Oh dang. Yeah, you could. Oh, we should get on that."
"Misty: Yeah, you should maybe get on..."
"Brennan: Bilbry says,"
"Bilbry: Well, I'll tell you what. If we want this place magically protected, I've been working on something that turns people into drawings."
"Pete: No, thank you."
"Kingston: You know what, Bilbry\--"
Misty: Very intense.
Ally: I'm wiping oyster off my body.
Sofia: I am here for beta testing.
"Kingston: You guys wanna go grab some cheesecake? 'Cause, you know, I just feel like--"
Siobhan: Can I just do a pass around with my Mirror of Manannan to see if there's anything invisible?
Brennan: You see--
Siobhan: Ethereal.
"Brennan: With the Mirror of Manannan, you look around and see that there is a little bit of residual pixie dust here in the room."
Siobhan: Ah. Can I take a little bit of it and put it in--
"Brennan: Yes, pick some up, go for it."
"Misty: Pete, give me a baggie."
"Pete: Oh yeah, for sure."
Ally: And I just dump it on the ground and like kind of smudge it.
"Misty: All right, that's a waste. Not all of us are sober."
Pete: I'm swimming in money.
"Brennan: Wonderful, guys. Yeah, you guys head off to go get some cheesecake. The gnomes see Bilbry flies you back."
"Bilbry: Well, it's been an absolute pleasure. Feel free to come back anytime."
Kingston: Well--
Sofia: I definitely will.
Pete: Thank you.
"Kugrash: Bill, can I have a motorcycle?"
Bilbry: What's that?
Kugrash: Can I have a little motorcycle?
"Misty: Oh, rat sized motorcycle."
Bilbry: I'll build you… You want a motorcycle?
Kugrash: Yeah.
Bilbry: I can build you something better than a motorcycle.
"Kugrash: Hell yeah, man."
Misty: He'll just take a motorcycle.
"Bilbry: What about instead of wheels on the bottom, it has wheels on the top?"
Sofia: I'll take that one.
Bilbry: Okay.
Brennan: You see he—
Kugrash: I'll take a regular one.
Brennan: He takes off.
Misty: He's very enthusiastic but sometimes too creative.
Kugrash: He's riding around on a little cool thing. I want that.
Sofia: I want that too.
"Kingston: Everybody, you know, if we are gnomes, none of you are, should be drinking eight thimblefuls of oil a day, but nah, that woman was hit with a very powerful Sleep spell by pixies."
Misty: Well—
Pete: Wow.
"Misty: I do have a spell called Locate Creature that works better if I have,"
"Siobhan: And I shake the pixie dust,"
Misty: A little bit of something from them—
"Pete: That's great, that's great. Let's do it."
"Sofia: I just wanna, just as an update, I spied on my family and they were working with the Confettis. They owe Don Confetti another favor 'cause we fucked them over by killing Isabella Infierno, but they did mention the Confettis, they're nothing. They're shit. They're working for someone else. They're under someone else."
"Pete: It was probably Bob, right?"
"Kugrash: But we can, we can probably go through the..."
Sofia: Probably Bob.
Ricky: Did you burn your house down?
Sofia: I did.
Pete: What?
Kingston: I'm sorry?
Misty: What?
"Sofia: I, you know—"
Misty: Do you need a place to stay?
Sofia: Sometimes you gotta burn a bridge so you don't go backwards.
"Misty: Well, but you didn't burn a bridge, you burned a house."
Sofia: Yes.
"Kingston: Yeah, your house."
Sofia: Yeah.
Pete: Did you—
"Sofia: I did, yeah."
Ricky: It feels really reckless. I just wanna throw that out there.
"Sofia: I'm sorry. You know what, Ricky, I didn't realize as I was doing it that you might take it personally and I—"
Ricky: I just can't believe you'd do that.
"Sofia: I realize now how potentially offensive that was to you and I'm really sorry. I should have come up with a better, a safer way to recklessly abandon my previous life and make peace with my husband's death. I'm sorry."
Brennan: Does Misty cast Locate Creature?
Siobhan: Yes.
Brennan: Wonderful.
"Siobhan: So it's if the creature is within a thousand feet of you and if the creature is moving, you know the direction of it."
Lou: How long does it take to cast?
Siobhan: It's one action and then it's a concentration spell that lasts up to an hour.
Emily: Should we save it for when we think that we're right near where they are?
"Murph: I have the bagel,"
"Emily: Oh, yah maybe we should do that."
Murph: Should I use the bagel to ask a question about if it's close or not?
"Siobhan: Yeah, you're right."
Emily: Oh.
"Siobhan: So, I'm gonna use my Divination Bagel."
"Kugrash: All right, guys."
Murph: I pull out my bagel.
Siobhan: Scrape off the crumbs from the cheesecake.
Murph: Scrape off some crumbs onto a plate.
"Sofia: Oh my god, that looks so good."
"Murph: And I ask the powers that be,"
"Kugrash: Oh great dirt and shit of the city, are we, how, you know, hot, cold, where in the middle are we to these pixies that fucked up this poor little gnome?"
"Misty: North, south, east, west."
Brennan: You see that the answer comes back to you. You divine in the different sesame seeds and poppy seeds and little bits of onion on the plate that the pixies have long since vacated and are nowhere in the premises. But you see that the plate also tells you to hold onto the pixie dust.
Kugrash: Okay.
Misty: Great.
Pete: Cool.
Kugrash: The bagel has spoken.
Ricky: Do we know where these pixies normally congregate?
"Pete: Oh yeah, where was the hole again?"
Ricky: You could call the pigeons.
"Misty: Yeah, get Perry on the job."
Pete: That's great.
Misty: I do worry that the pigeons are working now with the pixies.
"Pete: I think the pigeons are so dumb, we can always use them."
"Sofia: Not to mention, Perry loves, I mean let's be honest, we all see it, Perry's got a thing for you."
Pete: We all see it. Perry's head over heels.
"Kugrash: No, he's just a pigeon."
Pete: I've never had someone that in love with me in my life.
"Sofia: Honestly, no."
"Misty: I have a few times, but not for a couple hundred years."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Wonderful. So you guys have some loose plans here but I just wanna also, just because of time, wanna move us along. You guys, do you wanna reach out to pigeons or investigate pixies or anything like that?"
"Murph: Do we wanna go to the pixie place or do we… Yeah, I'll, should I waste that? It's a 3rd level spell, Conjure Animals."
Ricky: Can you call her? Did you text her?
Siobhan: Can you text Perry?
"Emily: Yeah, can you just text Perry?"
"Murph: Yeah, can I just contact Perry? I'd like to contact Perry."
"Brennan: Yeah, Perry contacts you and says,"
"Perry the Pigeon: Ha, I've been waiting for this message. [chuckles]"
"Kugrash: Hey, Perry, you been, I know Ronald Pigeon married into the pixie family, yeah? You pigeons been working with pixies at all?"
"Perry the Pigeon: Well, we've been around their space. If you want us to keep an eye on them, I'd be happy to do that for you."
"Kugrash: That'd be great, Perry, I would really appreciate it."
"Emily: Oh my god, you're manipulative."
"Perry the Pigeon: I'll be a shadow, unseen, in the distance, always watching. They'll never know my movements, but I will know all of theirs."
Kugrash: My guy on the inside.
"Perry the Pigeon: Kugrash, by my life or death, I'm gonna fuck you one day."
Brennan cracks almost immediately at the end of this line and laughs.
"Kugrash: All right, Perry."
Perry the Pigeon: One day.
"Kugrash: Perry, you know what, let's not mix business and pleasure. I know we have strong feelings for each other, but we have to work together through this deep sexual tension."
"Perry the Pigeon: I'll let you know as soon as I… It might be a couple days, but I'll let you know as soon as I find something out."
"Kingston: Kugrash, this is immoral. I'm gonna tell you all right now, this is very immoral."
"Sofia: Yah, Kug. Unless you have feelings for Perry that you've been dodging—"
Kugrash: You know what? Easy to respect the fact that I just want to be friends. This is on Perry.
Sofia: You just told him that you don't want to be friends.
"Misty: So, you've got stuff to do. I get it, I'm on your side—"
"Kugrash: Thank you, thank you, Misty."
Sofia: I guess I burned my own house down.
Ricky shakes his head sadly.
"Brennan: You guys, the next couple days pass by as Christmas fast approaches."
[gentle piano cover of ‘Carol of the Bells’]
"Brennan and Siobhan: [singing] Ding dingy dong, ding dingy dong, ding dingy dong ding dingy dong."
"Brennan: Let's talk about Christmas comes around. Let's see where we're gonna start. So, a beautiful Christmas at Kingston's place uptown in Harlem. Pete, you eat like a fucking king. What do you guys do at your beautiful Christmas? Oh, you see that cousins and uncles and aunts and other families from the building and the block come by. You guys stack tables up so it moves, like there's tables in the kitchen and just like long, multi-room table gets built. Just joy and wonder, the kids wake up that morning."
Ally: I got a haircut and I'm wearing like a really nice chain and like the cleanest jersey I own.
"Brennan: Incredible. You see that all of Kingston's various nieces and nephews are like very into the chain, very into the tattoos, very into your weird haircut, either to celebrate and ask questions, or to actively mock and make fun of."
"Ally: Yeah, that's probably most of it."
Brennan: Yeah.
Ally: I'm in suit pants also. Like pinstripe suit pants and the jersey's tucked in.
"Pete: I don't know what I'm doing, man."
"Kingston: Pete, honestly, it's Christmas. You can be whatever you want."
"Pete: That's really, it takes a lot off my mind, man."
"Kingston: Of course, man. I mean, I'mma wear a white T-shirt, some khaki pants."
Pete: Oh great.
Kingston: And a blazer.
"Pete: Oh, a blazer, that's what I need."
Ally: I look for a blazer.
Emily: A blazer over a jersey?
Lou: Can I give Pete a Christmas present?
Brennan: Absolutely.
"Kingston: Here you go, Pete."
Pete: Oh my god.
"Kingston: It's a bag of cherry tomato seeds. I thought you might be able to, you know, we could put a planter on the roof or something come spring."
"Pete: I'm big into gardening. Oh man, thank you so much."
"Kingston: I mean, if you're still here or wherever you go. I mean, you don't have to be here. I don't wanna assume like that. But wherever you go, you know, here's some big, big bunch of cherry seeds. And then also, you know, I was walking around Times Square and I saw this zebra cowboy hat and I thought you might like that. So, I don't know."
Ally: [grinning maniacally] I swap it out for my cowboy hat immediately and I now I look full-on like I've been dared to dress this way.
Lou cackles.
"Brennan: You see that Winston also gets you… You're like flush with gifts for the first time in probably a couple Christmases. And you see that Winston gets you a set of dominoes and looks,"
"Winston: There you go, kid. I'm gonna kick your ass."
"Pete: Oh no, you're not."
"Winston: I'm gonna kick your ass, my friend."
"Pete: No, you're not. This is so nice."
Brennan: And you see that Victoria has been very worried about you and gets you this giant puffy sweater.
"Pete: Oh, thank you."
"Brennan: A big Christmas sweater for you to stay warm. Kingston, you actually get a gift too."
Lou: Really?
"Brennan: Yes, you do. You get one of those nice, really like gourmet, not overly sugary, like very tasteful chocolate bars, that's like one of those expensive chocolate bars. And you get a MetroCard that is purple and covered in stars much like the train to Nod was."
"Lou: Oh, okay. Very, very nice."
"Emily: Can we also say I had the foresight, just 'cause during this I wanted to, I wanna have sent everyone edible arrangements. It's just 'cause it will arrive."
Ally: I'm eating the driest strawberry I've ever had in my life.
Misty: The pineapple is so--
Brennan: [to Murph] Do you have your family's names in front of you?
"Murph: Yes, yes."
"Lou: I take the edible arrangement and I put it like, in the bathroom—"
Murph: David.
"Brennan: David, what's his wife?"
Murph: David and Diane.
"Brennan: And Diane. And his kids, do you have his kids' names?"
Murph: Matt and Delia.
Brennan: Matt and Delia?
Murph: Yes.
Lou: I'm sure people will eat this.
"Brennan: Kugrash, you have, Wally goes out with you. You have Christmas Eve with him. You guys are talking all day, and the next day you head out."
"Murph: I also would like to say, I want to have like summoned animals the night before and I wanna give Wally a Christmas present. I want to give him a dog. I want to have like domesticated a stray dog with my druidic powers."
"Brennan: He's so happy. He goes,"
"Wally: Aw, it's a little buddy for me."
"Kugrash: Right, yeah."
Wally: I love him. He's great. I'm gonna name him Dad after you.
"Kugrash: That's a great name, Wally."
"Siobhan: Oh, Wally."
Ally: [covering their face] Oh Wally.
"Brennan: You see that, you go out to Forest Hills that day. It's a very stressful time. There's two dogs in the back. Wally shows up at the door. And he goes up to the door and he winks at you. David enters and goes,"
"David: Hey, Wally, merry Christmas."
"Brennan: Gives him a hug and he goes,"
Wally: I got two dogs. One is Dad.
"Brennan: And you see that he looks down and you see, he looks down and goes,"
"David: Oh, this one's named Dad. Very cute, Wally."
"Kugrash: David, I need to talk to you for a second."
Murph: I speak as a dog.
Brennan: As a dog? He looks at you and he goes
David: [stammering] What?
Kugrash: We need to—
Brennan: I'm gonna need you to make a Wisdom check to break the Umbral Arcana. It's a DC 20 Wisdom check to snap him into the Umbral Arcana.
Murph: Can I use Dispel Magic or anything—
Brennan: You can use Dispel Magic. So that's gonna be your spell attack instead of Wisdom to beat a DC 20.
"Murph: Okay, I'll do that. Fuck, 14."
"Brennan: 14\. So you see, he goes, you go, David, I wanna talk to you. And you see,"
"David: Hey, there's a good boy, huh."
Brennan: And scratches behind your ear.
Lou: Oh god.
"David: There's a good boy. Come on, he's a feisty little guy."
"Kugrash: Well, Wally, at least you don't need to lie. We're fucked."
Brennan: He scoops you up and you're in David's arms in a hug.
Murph: I lick my son's face.
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: You see, he goes, ah. He says,"
"David: I like this guy, what's this guy's name?"
"Brennan: And you see, he goes,"
Wally: His name is Kugrash.
"Brennan: And you see he goes,"
"David: Kugrash, all right."
Brennan: Sits down. And you spend a Christmas Day in front of a warm fire in a nice home with your grandchildren.
"Murph: I'm running around, playing with my grandkids."
"Ally: Aw, that's sweet."
Siobhan: [a little choked up] Oh my god.
Lou: Oh my god.
Murph: Having a great dog time but also being devastated.
"Brennan: You eat delicious dog food and it's the best. It's the best Christmas that you've had in years, far and away."
Lou: [hands over his heart] Oh my god. Huh.
Brennan: Sofia.
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: For your Christmas.
Emily: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: You see that Jackson says that the monastery doesn't take Christmas off.
Emily: Oh. So I can't even go to my family.
"Brennan: You see, he says,"
"Jackson: You can leave for your own reasons, you can, but we'll be here training."
Sofia: Can I take a half day?
Jackson: You can take a half day.
Emily: All right. I'm just gonna show up at my family's house. I'm still dressed in all black in mourning.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Emily: And I bring an uncooked Christmas goose.
Siobhan: Jesus.
Ricky: That's amazing.
Siobhan: Throw it on the table.
Emily: And then I'm just gonna go in.
"Brennan: You head in. You have the most tense family dinner. Everyone, you see—"
Emily: I'm there like as an act of defiance. Like that's me being like I'm not scared of you. That's my purpose of going there.
"Brennan: It's a mostly silent dinner table. Your dad every once in awhile will be like,"
"Anthony: Good stuff, uh-huh, it's good."
"Emily: Is there, I also wanted to… I don't know if this would work with the Umbral Arcana, but I wanted to use Hellish Rebuke to cook the goose in front of them as like a casual—"
"Brennan: They don't know what they're looking at, but you see they go like, ah, I guess it was cooked."
"Emily: All right, I'll take that. I'll take that minor confusion."
"Brennan: They're like a little bit confused. You see that your mom, when you show up, she's the only one who really says anything. As you show up, she says,"
"Maria: Glad you're here for Christmas, Sof."
"Brennan: And about 20 minutes into dinner, she excuses herself and comes back in and has taken off her little Christmas sweater and is wearing a black top."
Emily: Oh my god.
Brennan: You see that—
"Emily: I think I'm gonna leave her a little note before I leave. Like a jewelry box that I know my father would never go into. And I'm gonna give her like the number to my new burner phone and I'm just gonna say,"
"Sofia: I love you, Mom, but I don't trust the rest of the family. This is my new phone number, but it's only for you."
"Brennan: After you leave Christmas dinner that night, you get a little text on your phone which is a like, oh and it's like your little burner phone, but you see it's like a photo image of a screen capture of one of those merry Christmas email forwards that moms send. And she sends it to you on your phone."
Emily: I send her a selfie back. A Sofie selfie.
"Brennan: You get the response back,"
Maria: So cute. Love the hair.
Ally: Sweet.
"Brennan: Ricky. Ricky, Ricky, Ricky. What are you doing for Christmas? Breakfast with your family?"
"Zac: Ricky probably did like a early Christmas with his family and then he's at the firehouse, you know, working the like, you know, someone's gotta be working shift. And he probably sent everybody advanced previews of the next year's fireman's calendar."
Ally: Oh.
"Emily: Oh my god. If I had known that, I would've just stayed home."
"Brennan: Incredible. Oh, I forgot to mention, by the way, Kingston, your Christmas, you're trapped with a lot of your cousins. There's like, it's so full, it's just the most vibrant, like warm, it's like hot in here with all the people. You see that a lot of your friends of the family are talking to you when Pete is around and are mentioning like all the different fields and jobs they work in. And some of them are working at places that are hiring right now."
"Lou: I think I'm constantly being like, talking about Pete and how talented he is, and how outgoing he is and his go-getter nature, and the fact that he's in between things right now and that it would be, I don't know. Somebody might be very lucky."
"Ally: You look over, I'm in a really puffy sweater and a zebra cowboy hat."
"Kingston: Yeah, he just has a ton of personality. I'm telling you right now. I mean, this kid, he walks into a room—"
"Party Goer: Well, the bookstore, we just need reliability."
"Kingston: Well, let me tell you something right now. Your books, what are your sales at the bookstore?"
Party Goer: I mean—
Kingston: Double that.
[Brennan laughs]
Kingston: Double that.
[Emily laughs]
"Emily: Wait, what team is your jersey for?"
Ally: The Pistons. It's like an old Pistons jersey.
"Brennan: Cool. At the firehouse, you see that you guys are having, the Johns are all there. You see that they're making like fire house dinner, you guys are all having your like firefighter secret Santa. You see that probably like the third year in a row, one of the Johns has gotten you ""The Four Agreements"". The self-help book. And he's like,"
"Johns: Bro, I'm gonna be honest with you right now, these changed my life."
Ally: That's so fucking funny.
"Johns: Dude, your word is impeccable, right? You live by your word."
Ricky: Awesome.
"Johns: And you don't take anything personally, 'cause anything that someone does that you feel like offends you, like that's just someone living their truth, living their life, right?"
"Ricky: Got it. This is a really good gift, thank you."
"Johns: Hey, dude, I'm always here for you to talk about your feelings. And John is always here if you need to talk about your feelings. And John is always here if you need someone to talk about your feelings."
"Ricky: I appreciate that. Yeah, I'm good right now. I pretty much have said everything I felt every time we talk, dude."
"Brennan: You see that one of them puts back a Miller High Life and goes,"
"Johns: Fuck it, dude. You guys wanna go caroling sometime?"
Ricky: I'd love to.
[Brennan laughs]
Brennan: You see that all three of them start going like...
Johns: [singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly.
Ricky and Johns: [singing] Fa la la la la la la la la!
"Brennan: You're all just like holding each other and… At that exact moment, you guys are kind of like in the, near where the firetruck is. As you're like holding each other and singing, you see that Esther rounds the corner."
"Ricky: Oh, hey."
"Johns: Fuck,"
"Brennan: You see all the Johns,"
"Johns: Fuck, fuck, fuck. Bail, bail, bail, bail, bail."
"Ricky: It's all right, it's okay. Hey, don't bail. Hey, Esther, we're just singing."
"Johns: Hey, are you Esther? Hey, my name's John. This is my boy, John, this is my boy, John."
"Brennan: And you see that they all go over to Esther. They're like,"
"Johns: Hey, we're all gonna head up because we are making some eggnog. If you guys want in, holler. If not, that's chill. Later. And you see—"
"Ricky: Thank you, thank you."
"Brennan: You see that Esther has some gift-wrapped presents next to her. And she looks at you and says,"
"Esther: Hey, Ricky."
"Brennan: And she has a little Santa Claus hat on. You see she says,"
"Esther: Hey, Ricky. I know I should have texted. I was just sort of in the area 'cause I'm sort of on the way to… I'm sorry. Christmas is a hard time of year for me. And I was wondering if I could impose on you, I know, you're obviously working right now. Forget it, I'm sorry."
"Ricky: No, no. What's up? What's up? What's up, Esther?"
Brennan: Give me a Perception check.
Zac: I got a 18.
Brennan: You see that she has two gifts under her arm and one says ‘for Mom’ and one says ‘for Grandma’.
"Ricky: Oh. Do you, I mean, there's, we got everybody here. I could peel off if you need some help with something."
"Esther: Yeah. I was just wondering, I know that you, part of you being sort of the champion that you are, it feels good to be around you, magically speaking. Magically speaking. When there are certain arcane forces present. So I was wondering if you could keep company on a little errand that I have to run."
Ricky: Yeah. Awesome.
Esther: Thanks.
Brennan: You head off with her. Do you bring Ox with you or no?
Zac: Yes.
[gentle acoustic guitar music]
Brennan: Cool. You guys go along. She walks with you. She's pretty silent for most of the trip.
"Ricky: Do, so you're giving some gifts to your grandmother and mom?"
Esther: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
"Ricky: It's good to give gifts, right?"
"Esther: Yeah, obviously. It's important to let people know--"
"Ricky: Oh, I give her a calendar."
"Brennan: She looks at it and goes,"
"Esther: Oh, wonderf… Hey."
Ricky: Just for the dates and stuff.
[Emily laughs uncontrollably]
"Ricky: It's good to keep track. I'm not naturally very organized, so it's just I find that it helps me."
"Esther: Thank you, Ricky, I appreciate it. Thank you, I appreciate it."
Ally: Good god.
Emily: [laughing to the point of tears] That's so funny.
"Brennan: You guys go to the Lower East Side and as you get to the Lower East Side, you head over to Tompkins Square Park. This is like a wild place, and you feel a lot of like, weird magic down here, forces of chaos kind of moving around. But in Tompkins Square Park at the border of Alphabet City, and as you walk into the park, you see there's like a little layer of frost and the trees are bare of leaves. And as you step further in, a small glade appears, sort of grotto in the midst of the park. And as you walk up, you see there are two women standing in the park, clothed in winter robes. One of them is hunched over, leaning on a wooden staff with these white and faded like lavender, icy blue, silvery robes. And you see that the other is standing very tall. Taller than you and Esther. Both women, you immediately recognize as having a family resemblance to Esther. And you see that the tall woman does not hold a staff but instead holds a sort of scepter. This beautiful wrought thing. Her eyes and the eyes of the older woman are completely milky white as though their sight has left their body. You see Esther walks up and puts the gifts down in front of them. The woman who's sort of standing erect, she looks to be sort of not as old as the woman who's hunched over, but sort of, you know, 50s or 60s, something like that. Goes,"
"Gabriela: You have come again, daughter of sorrow. Your time to join us will come soon."
"Brennan: And you see that there is this little sewing wheel next to them, this old school sewing wheel with a little needle pointing out. And you see that she goes,"
"Gabriela: The time will come where you appear before us. When blood is drawn by the needle, we are complete. The time will come soon for you to join us."
"Brennan: You see Esther says,"
"Esther: [deep breath] Hey, Mom, hey, Grandma. It's Christmas time and I'm not expecting a reaction or a thank you or anything but I want you to know that I defy you, I defy the prophecy, I defy this. I've learned as much magic as I can to make this never happen and Merry Christmas. I love you both very much."
"Brennan: And you see she leaves the gifts in front of them. And she walks over, and you see that the two figures don't look menacing at all, and actually bend over as she goes to kiss them each on the cheek. And she turns around and looks at you, the two figures look over at you, Ricky, and kind of regard you coolly. And Esther turns around. Not crying, looks like she's got it together. And goes,"
"Esther: All right, we can head out, Ricky."
"Ricky: I'm Ricky, by the way."
"Brennan: You see that the old woman says,"
Patricia: [whispering] What darkness lies in the heart of Ricky Matsui?
She stretches out a hand and casts something.
"Brennan: Esther goes,"
Esther: No!
"Brennan: And you see that she opens a portal to— light comes out of your heart and she's like,"
"Patricia: Darkness, reveal itself."
"Ricky: So what, um."
"Patricia: Where is the dark—? Darkness, reveal."
"Ricky: Yeah, let me, I don't know. [looks down at his heart] Is it in there?"
"Patricia: This normally— [yelling creepily] Darkness, reveal itself!"
Zac: I just take a couple steps closer and like. [checks his heart again]
Patricia: Don't help me do this.
"Ricky: Oh, okay, yeah."
"Patricia: Fine, fine, fine. That's insane. Something's wrong with you. Honestly, that's your darkness is that— that's, that situation's insane."
"Ricky: Yeah, okay, got… Do you want a calendar?"
"Brennan: You see that the, you know, both of them sort of say,"
Gabriela and Patricia: Be gone from this place.
"Brennan: Speaking in unison. And Esther says,"
"Esther: Come on, Ricky, let's go."
"Brennan: She laughs a little bit and grabs your arm as she walks out. She's like,"
Esther: I'm very glad that happened. That's very funny.
Ricky: I fully forgot my jacket. I'm so cold.
"Brennan: When you see that she goes,"
Esther: Thanks for that. I appreciate it. Do you care to know about what any of that was about or do you?
Ricky: I could go either way. Do you want me to know? 'Cause I don't have to know. But I wanna know if you want me to know.
"Brennan: You see, she says,"
"Esther: Honestly, maybe some other time."
Ricky: Okay.
Esther: Thanks for helping me out.
Ricky: No problem.
"Brennan: And she walks away with you. Misty. You have your lovely Christmas, like, probably holiday party people over, yeah."
"Sofia: Yeah, I mean, theater people, so many people are from out of town and the show must go on. You know, you don't really get a holiday off. And then I also have one of those trees that's like so tall and so exquisitely decorated and has those like thick ribbons around it."
"Ally: Yes, like a mall Christmas tree."
"Siobhan: Well, you know, like the Presidential Christmas tree."
Ally: The city's Christmas tree.
"Siobhan: Just like, how-- Is it somebody's job that they make these Christmas trees?"
"Brennan: Yeah, your holiday parties are like the talk of the town. People love these fucking holiday parties. And everyone's having a ball. People are talking, laughing. Alissa's running around, trying to get everything right. You see that Benjamin's talking to Perry. Perry's very excited 'cause the musical's about to open. You see everyone is fucking here. Art luminaries, Stephen Sondheim is here."
"Misty: Oh, darling!"
"Brennan: Stephen goes,"
"Sondheim: Misty, I understand that you're going to really wow us with this performance. I'm very, very excited for what we're about to see."
"Misty: Oh, well darling. Well, I'm just so excited for you to see it because I really think it's some great work. And I really feel like I'm aging into this new thing which is so fun, you know what I mean? Everybody else seems so stressed out about getting old, but I love it. It's just a new aspect of me."
"Sondheim: Oh, I couldn't agree more. Age before beauty, as they say."
"Misty: Oh, absolutely."
"Brennan: Alissa comes up and says,"
"Alissa: Ms. Moore, I'm so sorry to interrupt."
"Misty: Every time, Alissa."
"Alissa: I hate myself, I fully hate myself. [nervously laughs]"
"Misty: You just, all the talking you're doing is wasting more of my time."
Alissa: Help help help. There's some people at the door. They're not on the list but they said that you would know them and they were here for the party.
"Misty: Sure. Darling, I'll be right back. Don't worry."
Siobhan: And I go to the door.
Brennan: You see Robert Moses and his four pals at the door.
"[dark electronic synths, beating heart sound]"
"Misty: Oh, Robert, so nice to see you. Merry Christmas."
"Robert: Merry, Merry Christmas, Ms. Moore. I would come in myself but my friends actually need to be invited in."
Misty: Mnm… Why don't we go up to the roof and have a little chat there?
"Robert: Oh, well. After you, Ms. Moore."
"Brennan: And he walks up. You go to the roof. You see the other vampires give you a little bit of distance. You see that he lights up a little cigarette and says,"
Robert: Smoke?
"Misty: No, no, I would never. My voice."
"Robert: [smokes] That's right. Well, I heard this was the soiree of the season."
"Misty: Yes, it's a thrilling little bash. I do love the holidays. Little sing- song around the piano."
Robert: Yeah.
Misty: Love and joy and peace.
"Robert: I thought I'd drop by. That was some showdown at that kid's art party, huh?"
"Misty: Yes. That building, very dangerous."
Robert: I'd say so.
Misty: A lot of fire.
Robert: I'm a reasonable man and I like to resolve things peacefully where and when I can.
"Misty: Well, I'm a reasonable woman and I do love peace, as you know."
"Robert: Things are gonna get bad. They're gonna get real bad. I understand what this show is all about that you're doing and I wanna offer to help broker something between you and the fae court, get you out of New York while it's still safe."
Misty shakes her head and sighs.
"Robert: No punishment, no debt, no nothing. I can make it very easy for you."
"Misty: You know, Robert, I love a comedy. And I love a farce. I'd like to remind you of who it is that started this and it's not me and it's not my friends. But I can assure you, Robert Moses, that we will be the ones to end it if you do not. Do you understand me?"
Robert: Clear as crystal.
Brennan: He flicks the cigarette butt away.
"Robert: Merry Christmas, Misty."
"Misty: Merry Christmas to you and to you, a good night."
Brennan: They vanish.
[exuberant jazzy showtunes]
"Brennan: It's the day of Misty's opening! Oh my god, the musical! It's happening."
Siobhan: I've given away so many free tickets at this point that there are some people that are—
"Brennan: Who are the people that you've, actually, give me a quick list of who you've invited."
"Siobhan: Oh, honestly, I don't remember who I gave—"
"Brennan: Oh, incredible."
"Siobhan: Everybody we met, I feel like I gave tickets to."
Brennan: A shit-load of people are here. All of you guys are here for Misty's big night.
Siobhan: I have like three rows of tickets that are all my guests.
"Brennan: Perfect, perfect, perfect."
"Emily: I did put on, even though I'm in mourning and I'm trying to be an ascetic monk, I did go out and buy a really tight black dress for this."
[all chuckling]
"Brennan: You guys watch, the play starts. It's on Broadway, the lights. You go through the lobby. The little sippy cups of wine. Beautiful old theater. Cherubs and unicorn stone. In box seats, incredible. Misty, you see that Stephen Sondheim winks at you and says,"
"Sondheim: Knock 'em dead. I'm excited. You see, break a leg."
Misty: Such a fan.
"Brennan: The first act, Misty fucking kills it. The ritual's going off without a hitch. Intermission, you guys are all out in the lobby."
"Kingston: Some hell of a show, right?"
Pete: Yeah.
Kingston: Not bad. Misty's good.
Pete: Misty's really good.
"Kingston: Like, I know she's good, but she's good."
"Pete: I grew up watching musicals on Broadway and stuff, it's so fun--"
Ricky: It's my first play.
Pete: Really?
Ricky: Yeah.
Pete: Wow.
Kingston: How long have you been in the city?
Ricky: My life.
[all laughing]
"Brennan: The second half starts up. Misty, you're in costumes to town, you're killing it. It's the showstopper number, and you see that Alissa comes over and says,"
"Alissa: All right, I know you're about to go on, everything's in place. It's all done, sconces, the holly, the saucer of milk. And the mirror, I have the mirror in place."
"Misty: No no no, what mirror? No."
Alissa: The standing mirror from your room.
Misty: No.
Alissa: You said to put it… Wasn't that supposed to come here to the play?
"Misty: No, absolutely not. It was supposed to go to storage."
"Crew: Misty, five, four, three, two, go, go."
Misty: [singing] Uh
"Brennan: You step onstage. As you guys see Misty comes out and belts the opening notes to this thing, the mirror is back in the set dressing. All of you guys see [lips vibrating]. The mirror begins to glow. From the wings, you guys see in their own box seat, Don Confetti and his pixies all look around and go, 'cause they're great supporters of the arts, all kind of making eyes at you in the first half of the show, all look at it and go,"
"Pixies: Holy shit. Holy shit, holy shit."
"Brennan: You see Don Confetti goes,"
Don Confetti: Oh no. The greatest disaster I can imagine. This is horrible.
"Brennan: The mirror glows. [lips vibrating] The Lady Titania, and a host of Seelie warriors steps through the mirror. I'm gonna need all of you to roll Initiative."
Siobhan: Talk about stage effects.
Emily: Oh.
"Brennan: And that's all for this episode of ""The Unsleeping City"". Tune in next week."
Zac points at the initiative rolls on the table.
"Ally: Fuck, no."
Brennan: As the show must go on.
Murph: Two 1’s?
Ally: Two nat 1’s.

[NEXT TIME ON DIMENSION 20]
Brennan: You find ourselves opening night with Misty Moore taking the stage.
"Don Confetti: Holy shit, it's the Lady Titania back again."
Pete: What the fuck do we do?
Misty: Let's kill Titania.
Brennan: You're hitting her. In the middle of a jump.
"Emily: Foom, boom, boom, boom."
Brennan: You are lit the fuck up this round.
"Lou: What are you even doing, dude?"
Ally: You're sick.
Lou: Stop this guy.
"Brennan: If this ritual doesn't go off without a hitch, it's the end of your reincarnations."

[RECAP]
[electronic noise]
Brennan: [singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly!
"All: Fa la la la la, la la la la."
Brennan: The clock gnomes of Grand Central Station appear to be in a little bit of an uproar.
"Kingston: We gotta go back, Bilbry!"
"Bilbry: Behold, the train yards of the Clock Gnomes!"
Misty: I'm having a great time.
Ricky: Someone took something?
Hib-Hob: The Big Book of Bits and Bobbins.
Kingston: What about the Time Stone?
Hib-Hob: How do you know about Time Stones?
"Misty: Well, I'm a reasonable woman and I do love pieces, as you know."
Robert: Things are gonna get bad.
"Brennan: It's the day of Misty's opening! Oh my God, the musical! Stephen Sondheim is here."
"Sondheim: I'm very, very excited for what we're about to see."
Misty: Oh darling.
"Brennan: Misty fuckin' kills it, the ritual's going off without a hitch. As you're about to go on,"
"Alissa: Everything's in place, I have the mirror in place as well."
"Misty: No, no, no, what mirror?"
"Crew: Five, four, three, two."
"Don Confetti: Holy shit. Holy shit, holy shit! The greatest disaster I can imagine!"
"Brennan: The mirror glows, the Lady Titania. And a host of Seelie warriors steps through the mirror, I'm gonna need all of you to roll initiative."
Misty: Talk about stage effects!
[END RECAP]
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: Welcome, one and all, back to The Unsleeping City. My name is Brennan Mulligan, these are our intrepid heroes, say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Last we left our heroes off, they were going to see a Broadway show, and celebrating Christmas, things were looking up! There have been some strange goings on with the Clock Gnomes of Grand Central Station, But, we find ourselves opening night of Midsummer Nights, it's the final closing finale number, with Misty Moore taking the stage as the Lady Titania, as the mirror glows, [hums] it vanishes. [magical explosion] In a crack of light, gone! We see Lady Titania and her she-warriors, these Seelie dance fighters take the stage, across from you, the box seats from the intrepid heroes. [Don Confetti accent] Don Confetti and his pixie mobsters, are all starting to take a show and show off a little bit of their wealth."
"Don Confetti: [higher voice, Italian accent] Holy shit! It's the Lady Titania back again!"
"Brennan: Beyond them, in the box seat is Stephen Sondheim, watching the show happily, also in the very front row is Dupree St. Croix, the theater critic for the New York Times!"
"Misty: Ah, the Gray Lady."
"Brennan: I'm going to explain a couple different things now, 'cause this fight is a little different than normal."
"Siobhan: Oh no! I mean, oh good! [chuckles]"
Brennan: Misty.
[dramatic music]
Siobhan: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: You are in the middle of casting a ritual spell that is going to renew your body. You've done this probably about a half dozen times before, and it's what has enabled your immortality. If this ritual doesn't go off without a hitch, it's the end of your reincarnations."
Siobhan: Fuck.
[Emily gasps]
"Brennan: So you've, if the show is spoiled for any reason, if these people that you are harvesting glamor from do not enjoy this Broadway show, it means the end of your life."
Misty: The show must go on!
"Brennan: You will be making death-saving throws, not randomly and by chance, but with your Performance checks, every round that you go."
Zac: Oh!
Siobhan: All right.
Ally: Oh my God!
"Brennan: You are not incapacitated, you are not down, but the ritual needs three successes to work, and it needs three, and with three failures you die. There is--"
"Emily: Die or just, she just stays Misty Moore?"
Brennan: Only one way to find out.
Emily: Ohh!
Lou: We don't know that?
"Brennan: Misty hasn't told anybody. So… So, you guys do not know that that is the case. Normally for this ritual, the difficulty is very low for these performance checks. But the difficulty might be modified if, for example, you get stabbed a whole bunch of times. That might make your performance check a little bit more challenging."
Siobhan: Noted.
Brennan: So. What we are now going to do is we're also going to see who else showed up at premiere night. Misty has given some invitations out.
Ally: [laughs] Some.
"Brennan: Some invitations out, a ton. But not everybody necessarily showed up. So we're going to do a Box of Doom roll for a little bitty luck check here."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: We'll get the Box of Doom in, which I believe we have right here. The first thing we're going to roll for is, and I'm going to say that, because these are your close friends, they would definitely come. We're going to see if the members of the Gramercy Occult Society came to opening night, they're regular humans, they'll see a show. On an 11 or higher, Alejandro is in attendance. [Siobhan rolls a 4.] No, Alejandro is busy. Go ahead and pick again. On an 11 or higher, Esther managed to come by the show."
Siobhan: Come on. I can't see.
Brennan: That's a 19!
"Siobhan: Yes, okay! Esther is there."
[cheering]
Ally: Nice.
Emily: [poking Zac] Don’t get distracted.
Zac: I’ll try.
"Brennan: Wonderful. And one last roll. 11 or higher, let’s see what happens. [Siobhan rolls a 16.] Hey, Wally's here!"
Misty: Aww!
[everyone except Murph cheers]
"Murph: Yeah, oh no!"
Brennan: Oh yes! Here you go.
"Murph: Wally, oh God!"
"Siobhan: He's a good boy, Wally!"
"Murph: He's a good boy, I don't want him to get hurt!"
Ally: Oh no! Wally goes down! Jesus.
Siobhan: Esther and Wally are just hanging out. The smartest and dumbest people that we know.
"Brennan: I'm sorry, one more time. Do you remember that you did or did not give tickets to Em?"
Emily: I don't remember.
Brennan: I don't think you did.
Ally: Feel like you did.
"Emily: I definitely did Nod, it happened with Nod."
"Siobhan: Yeah, Nod it happened with, I really think I did, but if you don't think that I did, then you are the DM, and I bow unto you, my liege lord."
Brennan: I tell you what. We'll roll one last one for Em.
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: Let's see if Em is in attendance.
Emily: Let's see if a fountain came to see your show.
Siobhan: A 17?
"Brennan: 17, Em is in attendance."
Ally: Hey!
[cheers]
"Brennan: It's a big show, people would come out and see a good show, right?"
"Siobhan: Yeah. Look guys, sometimes you film things a long time in advance."
Ally: You gave some to the—
Siobhan: And you don't write them down and you forget about it.
"Brennan: Could you guys in the box seat behind you please put Wally, Esther, and Em?"
Lou: What a motley crew.
Ally: Em!
Zac: Do we know anything about...
Lou: Esther is cool as shit.
Brennan: Esther is—
"Emily: Oh my God, Esther fuckin' rules."
Lou: Wally's grounded as hell.
"Ally: Yeah, totally!"
Siobhan: I love his vest!
Ally: I think I'm into Em.
Brennan: Incredible.
Ally: What's your deal?
"Brennan: Yeah, you see, as Titania appears, the band is kicking out,"
[lively music]
"Band: [sings] ba da daa, baa, hey!"
"Brennan: Wally goes,"
"Wally: Well, it's the magic of Broadway, it really brings you all together."
"Brennan: Esther immediately knows something bad is going on, and you can see that, actually move Esther up into the box with you guys. That's probably where she is."
"Lou: Right next to Ricky, now."
"Brennan: Right next to Ricky. And then that's going, and then Em, who is sort of perched on the edge of the thing as a stone gargoyle goes,"
"Em: [heavy NY accent] Oh no, this is so bad."
"Brennan: That is going to be the beginning of combat. Kingston, you are first to act."
Lou: Okay. So I have no idea that this is a ritual.
Brennan: I don't believe that Misty has told anybody.
Lou: What would you—
Siobhan: A lady needs her secrets.
"Lou: What's the threat level assessment, I mean--"
Brennan: I'll allow you to make an insight check on your old friend Misty Moore.
"Lou: Great. 10, Insight?"
"Brennan: Yes, Insight."
"Lou: Insight. Yeah, 21."
Brennan: Do you roll advantage with Insight or no?
"Lou: No only Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion."
Zac: Only those.
Brennan: So you got an 18?
Lou: A 21.
"Brennan: Oh, a 21."
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: I'm going to say that you get Misty's eye contact for a second as Titania shows up. She looks very afraid, you know that Misty's fear is not related simply to the fact that Titania is here. There is also something going on, and you probably get a sense that Misty is already casting some kind of spell, but you don't know what it's for."
[Lou laughs incredulously]
Lou: Oh man! Okay.
Ricky: This play's awesome.
Lou: I...
Pete: Was that magic or special effects?
"Brennan: You see that the crowd as Titania appears all goes,"
"Audience: [excited, then confused] Whoa, oh, oh!"
Brennan: Mostly reacting to the fact that there's two Titanias on stage.
Lou: Mm-hmm. Got it. Mm. Can I see a fire alarm?
Brennan: Make an Investigation check.
"Lou: 9 plus… What's that, a 16."
Brennan: You do not see a fire alarm here in the box with you.
Lou: Okay.
"Pete: Are you okay, man?"
"Murph: Would the Umbral Arcana protect, if we use a fire spell, is that going to—"
"Brennan: With that 20 Insight, actually, Kug, give me an insight check as well."
Murph: Fuckin' of course.
Ally: I'll do an Insight.
Murph: 8.
Brennan: You get to give me Arcana if you want to as well.
Ally: 20.
Brennan: 20 arcana?
Ally: Not nat.
"Brennan: Not nat? Pete, this place is all your shit. This is all dream magic, it's the fuckin' theater, this place is, this play is A Midsummer Night's Dream. The Umbral Arcana is backing away from the stage out of respect for the place created by the actors here. So any magic that happened here would probably get the benefit of being behind a curtain of Umbral Arcana. So shit that happened on stage, if you put some zazz on it, could be perceived as performance by the audience."
"Ally: Okay, yeah. So we all get that."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: 'Cause you have telepathy, right?"
"Emily: Yeah, pass that along."
Brennan: Oh yeah.
"Ally: Yeah, I have Mind Link. So I'm like,"
"Pete: This isn't good, I don't think, guys."
"Ally: It's any willing creature, we can, oh, I can Mind Link with you! I mind link with you and say,"
"Pete: What? Are you okay, what the fuck is going on?"
"Misty: No, this is real bad! [sings] Da daa, da daa!"
"Pete: Tell me and I'll tell the group, what the fuck do we do?"
Misty: Let's kill Titania! [sings] Da da daa!
"Brennan: Great! Okay, so you guys have talked enough, I'm going to need that action."
"Lou: Okay, I need, I am, I'mma be like,"
"Kingston: All right. Things may be going down, the people need to get out of here."
"Lou: I'm gonna Bless you, one, two, and three, and then I'm going to scramble down on to the, I'd like to scramble down actually on to the, I can't go around here, correct?"
"Zac: Would you want to, nevermind."
"Brennan: You could go through the door, or you could just try to jump on to the stage with an Athletics check."
"Lou: I mean, I'm a 55 year old man, I'd like to figure out, I'm not the hero I once was, I'd like to go the normal way down."
"Brennan: Okay. You can take the stairs out, the back of your box seat. And make it down to the front row in front of the stage."
"Lou: Great, so Blessings on the three of them, and I'll make my way down to the stage."
Ally: What's a Bless for you now?
"Lou: It's, I think it's still--"
Ally: Still d4?
"Brennan: D4, but you can burn a higher slot to give it to more people. But you might not need to, 'cause you're all fuckin' spellcasters and don't need that."
Lou: Right now it's just the three of them.
Brennan: Cool. Great. That's a Bless from Kingston. That is now going to be--
Lou: Did you say I could move down here?
"Brennan: Yeah, actually, move all the way, so yeah. You're right under there, at the front of the stage, yeah. That's going to be Kugrash."
"Murph: Kay, I guess if this is all magic stuff. All right, I'm gonna cast Wall of Fire."
[flame whooshing]
"Kugrash: Hope you can make this work, Misty! There's going to be some fireworks!"
Murph: And I--
Ally: I Mind Link and tell Misty that.
Misty: [dancing] I love a finale!
"Ally: Everything we do, I'll let her know."
"Murph: So this is one of my fourth level spells. I can make a… I can make two different kind of walls, but the one I want to do is a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet high, I want to do it around her little crew here."
Brennan: My good man. Please be my guest.
Brennan hands Murph the flame minis to place.
"Emily: Oh, I love those flames."
"Murph: Oh boy. So ten feet, so I just want to put it right on top of them."
"Brennan: Okay, and you want it facing inward?"
"Murph: I want it facing inward so it burns them. I imagine they're going to move, so this is just kind of a one time attack for me. So you want me to just put it up in here?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and, 'cause it's your concentration, so it is—"
"Murph: It's my concentration, so—"
"Brennan: What's the range on that, by the way?"
"Murph: It is 20 feet diameter, and--"
"Brennan: But the range for casting, how far away can you—"
Ally: 120.
Murph: 120.
"Brennan: Okay cool, so you definitely can hit them there."
[roaring flames]
"Murph: [about the minis, which are transparent and red] I love these little gushers."
Ally: [laughs] Yeah!
Emily: The dried apricots?
Siobhan: Are they squishy?
Murph: They're little dried apricots. All right.
"Siobhan: They kind of look like they're going to be squishy, but they're not."
"Murph: Okay, all right, I think that's all I need."
"Emily: That's just good art, baby."
Lou: That’s just good art.
"Murph: Yeah, so they take, when it appears, they make a dexterity saving throw, and 5d8 fire damage, or half as much on a successful save."
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: Go ahead and roll your damage, and I'll let you know how much they all take."
Murph: Can I get some d8s?
Ally: Here's two d8s.
"Murph: Thank you. Just one more's good, I can just do two things. Ooh, oh my God! This is insane!"
Ally: Yeah.
"Murph: 16, 28, off the bat with four, hang on. 28. 36, right? 36. And then 40."
Brennan: [disbelieving] You do 40 fire damage?
Murph laughs satisfiedly and Ally nods.
Brennan: Jesus Christ!
Zac: To everyone or just...
Ally: To any of them that don't pass--
"Murph: That are in there, that don't pass, they're taking 20—"
Ally: And if they pass it's 20.
Murph: 20 to people who don't get it.
Brennan: Hold on.
"Siobhan: And that's the end of the fight, and we'll go home."
"Emily: Wow! I think we could roleplay the rest of this episode, yeah."
Brennan: So 20 to those who pass.
Emily: [crosstalk] Could just roleplay the show going well.
Lou: 40 to the—
Siobhan: [crosstalk] Bring out a piano and improvise the musical.
"Murph: 40 to the ones who fail. My first four I rolled two 6s and two 8s, which was pretty incredible."
"Brennan: Holy shit. [laughs under his breath] I need to see how close you are to… Oh, you motherfucker. You are not within Counterspell range."
All: Ohhh!
"Brennan: That's fucking wild. Yeah, you see, whoom! [whooshing] This fire goes up, yeah. The spell effect happening on stage, the whole audience just goes,"
Audience: Wow! [riotous cheering and applause]
"Brennan: As these elves shriek, aah! You do not hear a shriek from the Lady Titania, however."
Murph: Oy.
"Brennan: [sings] Bum, bum bum."
"Murph: Awesome, and I'll use my bonus action to do the juicy cockroach."
Ally: Nice.
Murph: To give everybody temp HP.
Ally: Which is how much?
"Murph: Does, it's 30 feet, can I get Misty and--"
"Brennan: Put it where you think you could get everybody. If you put it in the crowd, it might rupture the spell a little bit."
Murph: Okay.
"Brennan: So you might have to put it on stage, things on stage get less--"
"Murph: Got it, okay. Then I'll do, [places it down] bink."
Brennan: Give me a Performance check for the cockroach.
Murph: Oh my God.
Brennan: It's gonna use your Performance.
Murph: Insanely bad.
"Siobhan: Don't you have, I'm not gonna say."
Murph: [laughs] A minus 2. 1! 3 minus 2.
"Brennan: A 3 minus 2, so it's not a nat 1. So you see that, this giant cockroach appears, and the whole audience goes, ugh! And you see that Dupree St. Croix goes,"
Dupree St. Croix: [shaking his head] Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
"Brennan: But the cockroach looks out and goes,"
"Cockroach: [gravelly singing] Hey, fa sha dow! Hey, daa, I think about this! And all it's been there!"
"Brennan: Just really trying its best, incredible, so those people get temp HP that need that."
Emily: How much?
Ally: How much is it?
"Murph: It is, oh, what did I see, write out? Juicy cockroach, 5 plus druid level, so 14."
Emily: Whoa!
"Siobhan: Wow, I have 80 hp, that’s crazy."
"Brennan: You see Titania vanishes from here, appears directly upstage of Misty."
"Siobhan: You're upstaging me, bitch?"
"Brennan: You see that she, boom, appears there, takes no more damage from Wall of Fire. Looks over at the pixies over there, and she says,"
"Titania: [clear, cold voice] Don Confetti, I call your service once more."
[explosion]
Brennan: Boom! He and all his pixies get loopy little eyes.
"Don Confetti: [gravelly voice] Oh, ah! You got us!"
Siobhan: I cast Counterspell.
"Brennan: [laughs] Hell yeah! Go ahead and make the roll, she's casting a powerful spell."
Siobhan: Okay.
Ally: You got this. [clapping]
Murph: Come on.
Siobhan: That is a nat 1.
Murph: Oh fuck!
[magical explosion]
"Brennan: The spell still goes off, and has a bonus action, she's going to make an attack on Misty."
Siobhan: Goddamn!
Murph: Shit!
[suspenseful music]
Brennan: That's gonna hit.
Siobhan: [whispered] Fuck.
Brennan: One moment.
"Brennan shakes out what sounds like an entire bag of dice. Murph gasps. Zac laughs nervously, and Emily shoots Brennan a suspicious expression."
Siobhan: Oh my God!
"Emily: That's because you're looking for d4s, right? You just poured all those out to look for a d4? [laughs]"
"Siobhan: Yeah, just one d4."
Murph: He needs three whole d4s.
Zac: He needs one specific d4.
Lou: Brennan is very particular about this dice. And the dice he rolls.
"Murph: Yeah, he likes, he did d4. There's actually a d2 in there."
Zac: Coin.
"Brennan: She flicks a mote of light at you and says,"
Titania: Pretender! [singing] She must pay!
"Brennan: Whoom! And since she doesn't know she's in a play, but she does just sing most of her magic, which is helpful. You take 30 points of radiant damage."
Ally: Fuck.
Emily: Ay ay ay.
Siobhan: Thank goodness for that juicy cockroach.
"Murph: So juicy. Not a great performer, but you know, juicy."
"Brennan: That's Titania, Pete, it's going to be you."
"Ally: All right. [sighs] I cast, I'm going to cast Erupting Earth as a fourth level spell in the, it's the exact same diameter, it's the exact same everything, so at these remaining dancers."
[rumbling]
"Brennan: Oh shit, okay cool."
"Ally: It is another Dex saving throw. And I get to roll 4d12, and if they don't pass, they get half that damage."
Murph: Or if they pass—
"Ally: Oh yeah, yeah. If they pass. Does someone else have a d12? Or—"
Emily: I gots d12.
"Brennan: Cool, and it's a 20 foot cube."
"Ally: It's a 20 foot cube, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool, so it's four, it's four spaces by four spaces, so yeah, that definitely hits them all."
Ally: Mkay.
Brennan: Rad.
"Emily: Do they take extra damage, 'cause it's like the earth is erupting but it is also on fire?"
Ally: [crosstalk] Yeah!
Murph: [seeing Ally’s roll] Wow!
Ally: 37.
Brennan: ...37 bludgeoning damage?
Ally: And—
Siobhan: Jeez Louise.
Ally: That's now difficult terrain that takes a minute to clear.
Brennan: Rad. So that's gonna be—
Murph: So they move half.
"Ally: Yeah, so they move half speed."
Brennan: Okay. So they take 37 bludgeoning damage. Wild. These poor Seelie get real fucked up. [quietly] Jesus Christ.
Ally: And I'm going to… I'm going to run on stage.
Brennan: Dope. Give me an Athletics check to jump down there.
Ally: Sure.
Brennan: I'm also going to need a Wild Magic roll from you.
Ally: Athletics… I think that's 15?
"Brennan: 15, you make it, yeah. So—"
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: It's cost an extra five feet of movement, but yes."
"Ally: Okay, I just want to be next to the cockroach. [laughs]"
Lou: [sings] Just to be close.
"Ally: And Wild Magic, 11."
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: Phew!
"Brennan: Wonderful. So that spell that just got created, [imitates explosion] you guys see that Pete blasted [explosion] and that weird psychic, all the floorboards just rupture, and float, spinning around telekinetically, just clobbering the shit out of these Seelie elves."
"Emily: I mean, so far this is a fuckin' great show."
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: You see them go,"
Audience: [high-pitched] Wow!
"Brennan: You see, yeah, that Dupree goes,"
"Dupree St. Croix: [posh, judgmental] The special effects budget has not been spared,"
"Brennan: In his little notebook, as he takes—"
"Dupree St. Croix: But that cockroach, send this person back to off-off-off- Broadway."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Murph: Keep your head up, cockroach!"
"Brennan: Pete jumps back to, so Pete jumps down, [laughs] great. You see that Don Confetti turns his pixies around him, sees the two to his right and says,"
Don Confetti: [shouting] get Sondheim!
Brennan: And then turns—
"[dramatic, tense music]"
Emily: What!
Brennan: The other two each take off.
Ally: What?
Siobhan: How dare they.
Brennan: Hold on a second.
"Lou: Hmm, people be flying."
Brennan: This guy's up here. Bada-bum. I get this dude over here.
[Murph laughs]
Zac: What the fuck is happening?
"Murph: If Stephen Sondheim is killed, then your play won't get a good review."
Siobhan: Oh no!
Murph: It just might be dramatic.
"Brennan: Cool, hold on a second. [rolls something] Okay. I, so what you guys now see, is—"
Zac: Stephen Sondheim is—
Brennan: Now could you guys hand me Stephen Sondheim and the other two little pixies that are not Don Confetti?
Zac: Stephen Sondheim is for sure magical.
Siobhan: Oh yeah.
Ally: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Yeah, there's no way that he's a regular human being."
"Murph: Well, you know, creativity is magic, so."
Ally: Wow! The new you!
"Siobhan: Oh yah, all artists are in some way."
Ally: What’s your sign?
"Brennan: So you guys see two of the pixies rush over, you see that, yeah, Don Confetti says,"
Don Confetti: Get Sondheim!
"Brennan: And the two pixies fly over, [wings] They grab, you see Stephen Sondheim says,"
"Sondheim: Now I don't know what's happening, but this is not the kind of theater I'm, whoa!"
"Brennan: And then is lifted up out of his seat. They fly him under the arch back over here. These two fly out in other directions, and open fire on Misty."
Siobhan: Shit.
Lou: This is a wild show.
Zac: With a gun?
"Ally: Have you got shields or anything, or..."
"Siobhan: No, all I've got is charisma magic."
Lou: You got Shield?
"Murph: We've got to intercept, we need Ricky in there."
Brennan: I'm going to need a Constitution saving throw from Misty.
[multiple sighs]
Siobhan: Goddamn it. 17?
Brennan: That passes.
Ally: Nice.
"Brennan: You feel the bullets, pew pew, have little, pew! Like, pixie dust and poison in it. You do not succumb to the poison, but you do take another 7 points of damage."
Siobhan: Okay.
Ally: Tiny little bullets.
Siobhan: So cute!
"Brennan: Misty, it is your turn—"
"Siobhan: Okay, I have a question about these performance rolls."
Brennan: Yes.
"Siobhan: So I have advantage on performance. If I cast a spell that gives me advantage on performance, do I get to roll an extra die?"
Brennan: Unfortunately no.
"Siobhan: I'm done at that, I'm done at that point."
"Brennan: A thing that gives you advantage simply gives you advantage. And right now, the damage is not giving you disadvantage, it's just increasing the difficulty of the roll."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: Cool. In the last round, you took 37 points of damage."
Siobhan: I did indeed.
"Brennan: Which is, normally the DC for doing this ritual is only the DC 10. It is increased by half the damage you took in the previous round, which is going to be 18. So you need to beat a 28 on a performance check."
"Ally: What is your, what do you have to performance?"
Siobhan: I have 11 Performance.
Lou: So you gotta get 17?
Siobhan: So I gotta get a 17.
Ally: But you have advantage.
Emily: But you have two—
"Siobhan: But I have advantage, but even—"
Ally: But still...
Lou: It's four.
"Murph: You'll get it, you'll get it."
Emily: My god.
"Ally: You’ll get it, you’ll get it."
Siobhan: It is really rough.
Lou: You’ll get it.
"Murph: First one, you'll get it."
"Emily: This is a good one, I feel good about this."
"Murph: First one, you got it."
Brennan: Bring out the Box of Doom for this Performance check.
"Ally: If she had Bless or had Bardic Inspiration, would that add to this?"
Brennan: Bless and Bardic Inspiration and—
Ally: We'll remember to do that.
Siobhan: Can I give myself Bardic Inspiration?
"Brennan: You cannot give yourself Bardic Inspiration, but Tides of Chaos, Bend Luck, all that stuff works—"
Ally: You got it.
Brennan: On Misty.
Murph: Cool.
Siobhan: Okay.
"Ally: Oh, Tides of Chaos can be for anyone?"
"Brennan: Oh maybe it can't, sorry."
Ally: I'll check.
"Brennan: You double check that, yeah. Here's advantage, you need a 17 or higher for a success."
"Siobhan: Come on, a little Christmas miracle. I did not get--"
"Ally: Whoa, what did you get?"
"Siobhan: I got a two and four, don't waste your luck."
Ally: Fuck!
"Brennan: So, you are lit the fuck up this round. Just, boom! [magical impact] And you begin to sing through. Gah! But you hit, you miss your note as you are ruptured by Titania's attack of light. That is one failure."
"Murph: Do we know how bad, what is going on exactly?"
"Brennan: Misty, now it's your turn, so you can communicate anything you want to Pete."
"Misty: Pete, if I die, really bad things are gonna happen, I probably—"
Pete: Tell me everything you can.
"Misty: You know how you've been keeping some secrets, we'll talk afterwards, maybe I've been keeping some as well. Anyway, if I could not die, that would be great."
"Pete: Bullet points, are the fairies with us, who are we taking out, what—"
"Misty: The fairies are under some kind of hypnotic spell, I mean, the pixies are under some kind of hypnotic spell, the fairies are definitely against us. If we could kill Titania, that would be great. Please don't let me die."
"Kingston: Pete, we have to get these people out of here. Misty needs to make some kind of announcement. The show needs to end now."
"Pete: Misty, you need to make an announcement and end the show right now."
"Misty: Absolutely not, the show must go on!"
Pete: Don't be stupid!
"Misty: The show must, do you hear me?"
"Pete: Kingston is going to hit the fire alarm, and we're going to try to get everyone out, will that work?"
"Misty: Pete, you need to listen to me. Magic user to magic user."
Pete: Okay.
Misty: The show must! Go! On!
"Ally: I link to Kingston, say,"
"Pete: Do not let anybody leave, this has to look like a really good show."
"Kingston: If anybody gets hurt, if Sondheim gets hurt, we are out of here instantly."
"Pete: I know how big of a Sondheim fan you are, okay, I'm not gonna let him get hurt."
"Kingston: I'm a huge Sondheim, Into the Woods is one of the greatest shows that I have ever seen."
"Brennan: Misty, you now have your turn. So your performances can happen while you're casting spells and doing stuff."
"Siobhan: Great, so what I would like to do, this is over than a 30-foot cube, right? All of these people?"
"Brennan: These, Sondheim is out of the 30-foot cube, so--"
Siobhan: So these two aren't? Are you sure?
"Brennan: So you can go here, so this is 30 feet from the end of this, so those pixies are there. But the Seelie, no so, you can't get the Seelie and Sondheim and his pixies."
Siobhan: And the guys that have Sondheim as well.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: Okay. Are the Seelie trapped by this fire? Or are they, can they move out of the fire?"
Murph: They can move out of it.
Siobhan: They can move out of it?
"Zac: But they're also, movement is half, right?"
Siobhan: But then movement is halved?
"Ally: Their movement is halved by me, yeah."
"Siobhan: Okay. Well, I'm still going to do it, so I'm going to cast Hypnotic Pattern."
Ally: Great.
Brennan: Okay.
"Siobhan: Is there a way of casting it at a higher level, where I get more stuff, it doesn't say on this card."
Brennan: I don't believe so.
"Siobhan: Okay. [shining energy sounds] So anyway, I create a 30-foot cube within range, the pattern appears, each creature who is in the area sees the pattern, must make a wisdom-saving throw, on a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by the spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of zero."
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: And my spell save DC is 16.
"Brennan: Gotcha. So you're hitting those four Seelie and the one pixie above them, right?"
Siobhan: Yes.
Brennan: Okay.
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: And your, the DC again is, what, 6? Or 16."
Siobhan: 16.
Brennan: 16.
Siobhan: [play-offended] 6.
"Brennan: Sorry. 2. 3. You pull, I'm afraid, only the pixie away from Titania."
Siobhan: Dang.
"Brennan: So he's incapacitated, correct?"
"Siobhan: Yeah. He, yeah, he just can't move or do anything."
"Brennan: Gotcha. And did he make, he makes the save every round, or no?"
"Siobhan: The spell ends for the affected creature if he takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of the stupor, so it doesn't say—"
"Brennan: So he's just hovering, so as he's like,"
"Pixie: [high-pitched] Wow, I can't believe I get to see a real Misty Moore show, look at her go, I hate to have to kill her."
Brennan: And any bonus action? Or movement?
Siobhan: Yeah. I would like to… Very jazzily move upstage a little bit.
Brennan: Sure. And were you within five feet of Titania?
"Siobhan: Was I? No, I don't think so."
"Brennan: Do you guys remember, oh no, she was a little bit away from you, right?"
Siobhan: I was here. So I'm ten feet away.
"Brennan: Gotcha, cool cool cool, yep."
"Siobhan: And then I would like to look up at my good pal, you've not gone yet, right?"
"Emily: Yeah, I haven't gone yet."
Siobhan: Sofia.
Emily: Okay.
"Siobhan: And I'm not going to say anything to you, but in that moment, you know that I'm singing right at you, and this song is for you."
"Sofia: Oh my God, Misty Moore. Oh my God! It's like I've been friends with her for so long, but it still feels so cool!"
Siobhan: And I give you Bardic Inspiration.
Brennan: Incredible. Lovely. That's going to be these Seelie.
"Emily: Oh yeah, they haven't even gone."
Brennan: They haven't even gone. Ah-buh-buh-bah. So they've got to roll or die here.
Ally: Mm-hmm!
"Brennan: Let's go ahead and roll for them, DC on this is 16 as well, right? Yes. One, two… Three. Go ahead and roll damage for your Wall of Fire."
"Murph: Sweet. 14, 18..."
Lou: Jesus.
Ally: Fuck yeah!
Brennan: Are you rolling 8d8 right now?
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Murph: Oh sorry, 5d8."
"Brennan: Did you, you didn't roll 8d8 the first time, did you?"
Murph: I think I did. Fuck.
"Brennan: That's okay, no worries."
"Murph: Okay, so I fucked up."
"Siobhan: If it was 5d8 the first time, it would have still, the first four he rolled were still two—"
Ally: The highest ones.
Siobhan: Two eights and two sixes. And the other four were very--
Murph: I think you could subtract seven from what I did the first time.
"Brennan: Gotcha, cool cool."
"Murph: My first four were amazing rolls and my second half were middling. So this time is 8, 11, 13."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: 13, okay."
"Murph: Oh wait no, that was four, I'm an idiot. 14."
Brennan: 14 damage. Rad. So that's going to be...
"Murph: So I probably did around 30 the first time, then."
"Brennan: Cool. Gotcha. All of them leap through, see this one, and yeah, they definitely have the speed. And make it over to Misty."
Siobhan: Fuck!
Murph: Shit!
"Sofia: I'm coming for you, girl."
"Siobhan: Thanks, man."
Murph: We gotta get people in there.
"Brennan: Two. Three. And then… Let's take the fire with me. Four. Hold on one second, let me just make sure that I've got that all right. Hold on."
Lou: And it's difficult terrain?
Brennan: [realizing] Oh!
Siobhan: You said it's difficult terrain.
Ally: Halved.
Murph: Yes!
Brennan: They don't make it to you!
Murph: Nice!
[cheers]
"Brennan: They do not, hold on, let me just double check. 'Cause that, if one of them's right there, that's, even the one that's closest is 30 to make it to Misty. No!"
Siobhan: Thank fucking God.
Ally: [punching the air] Yeah!
"Brennan: Holy shit, you see that you can see them leap through the flame to get the fuck out of there, and Pete, you like, whoom! [magical whoosh] Whip the stuff around. The floorboards and theater ropes and bunches of, even lights come down. Actually, you know what? Hold on one second. [rumbling] Pete, as you focus your mind, a whole row of lights snaps off and fuckin' clobbers them, and they have to spend their round crawling through it as you, whum-whum-whum-whum-whum! Create this swirling tornado in the fire."
Ally: Fuck yah.
Brennan: [imitates whooshing] So all of them instead use a dash action to surround Misty.
Murph: Shit.
Siobhan: Okay.
"Ally: Okay, okay."
"Brennan: So they handle their weapons, they're readying to kill you, but they are not able to attack you that round."
Ally: Do something!
"Brennan: What a clutch fucking move. That is going to be, that fucking Erupting Earth, holy shit!"
Ally: That's so sick.
"Brennan: Sofia, that's you."
Emily: Okay. I would like to cast Jump on myself. And then I would like to jump to this costume rack and put on a costume.
"Brennan: Unfortunately there's a wall, there's a big arch right here, so we can't see it. But the thing that--"
"Emily: Can I jump to this and then swing down to the costume, my jump distance is tripled right now."
"Brennan: That is correct, I'm going to pull the jump calculator out. So you're casting Jump as your action and then moving. So yeah. You cast Jump, what's your strength, remind me?"
Emily: My strength is 13.
"Brennan: Five foot seven is 13, cool. You cast jump, where are you trying to make it to?"
Emily: So I'm basically trying to use as much movement as I can to go grab a costume and then enter the fray. I'm hoping to try and sell this as part of the performance.
Ally: There's a cockroach on stage.
"Brennan: Incredible, so without--"
Siobhan: I've seen weirder plays.
"Brennan: Remember you also, so Step of the Wind also increases your jump."
"Emily: And maybe fuck it, you know what? I'm not even going to cast jump, I'll—"
Brennan: Jump and Step of the Wind do work in harmony together.
"Emily: Yeah, that, yeah, but I think I don't even need it, though."
"Brennan: Okay. You can go 40 feet with a Jump check. So here's 40 feet. Oh my God, you can actually just make it there."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: That's insane, okay. That's insane."
"Emily: So I'm going to jump, woo!"
Emily knocks Esther’s mini off of the box on accident.
Lou: Esther!
"Emily: Sorry, Esther! I'm going to jump here, and then fall with my Slow Fall."
"Brennan: Okay. You fall with your Slow Fall, so what is your speed?"
Emily: And put on a costume.
"Brennan: Your speed's 45, so jumping does take your speed into account. So you're gonna have to use Step of the Wind to move more than 45 feet in the round, like jump--"
"Emily: But I'm using, I'm not, 'cause I used an action, oh, I can't use dash, okay. Yeah, I'll also spend a Ki Point."
"Brennan: Cool, you spend a Ki Point."
"Emily: Spend a Ki Point, I put on a costume."
Brennan: Great.
Emily: And then I run on stage.
"Brennan: This is actually, because you're grabbing a costume and this is also beauty work."
Emily: Uh-huh.
Brennan: I'm going to say make a dexterity-based Performance check. And you can roll with advantage.
Emily: Okay. [clears throat] So what do I add to it?
"Brennan: Your dex modifier, and if you're proficient in Performance, then that."
"Emily: So my performance and my dex, oh okay. So 8 plus, okay, so 19."
"Brennan: 19\. You grab something off the rack. You're in this shimmery, I'm going to say that you--"
"Emily: Can I come out and say,"
"Sofia: I may be little, but I am fierce!"
Emily: Which is a line from the show.
"Brennan: The critic goes,"
Dupree St. Croix: That line already happened about an hour ago!
"Brennan: Cool, but that's your turn."
"Emily: And then can I, I just want to wedge myself in between Misty and some of these guys."
"Brennan: Cool, let me just make sure, I know I'm being a stickler, but I'm just going to measure it out, 'cause you can move 90 feet, all told. So your jump to there is, what?"
"Emily: Was 40, you said?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I think it's 40, yeah, it's 40 to there. And then from the rack there is another 30, so that's 80, so you can get--"
Zac: 40 plus 30 is--
Murph: 70.
"Brennan: Oh 70! So you got another, you can move 20."
"Emily: Yeah, so… We're back to, okay, so one."
Brennan: Two.
Emily: Two.
Brennan: Three
Emily: Three.
"Emily: Four, okay, so I'm here."
Brennan: Cool. Awesome. That's Sofia.
Emily: Will that costume help me for future performance checks?
"Brennan: Your costume is going to give you advantage on performance checks. Your costume's going to give you an advantage, you also, if you want, there is a chorus in this show, so if you'd rather roll acrobatics and dance, you're welcome to do that as well."
"Emily: Oh, my acrobatics is dope, yes. I definitely do that."
Brennan: Incredible.
Emily: So I'm also dancing.
Siobhan: All those nights out in the Meat Packing District with your girls are finally paying off.
Ally: I think I've been to so many downtown dance shows I'm doing some pedestrian moves.
Brennan: That is fucking wild. Bada-boom.
Emily: What is that?
"Ally: It's like, all fucking nonsense."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: Confetti is going to, buh-buh-bum, fly a little ways away. Buh-buh- bum. Yeah, Confetti actually is going to fly right over here. Maybe even a little bit higher."
"Siobhan: Oh my God, you have a retractable flying thing? That's dope."
Ally: Wow. Wow!
Zac: This is an amazing theater.
Lou: Yah.
Zac: Cool.
"Brennan: One second. Lower it a little bit. Whew! I'm going to need Kugrash, Ox, and Ricky to all make dexterity saving throws."
"Zac: Plus 3, Aura of Protection? Oh—"
"Brennan: Yes, Aura of Protection."
Siobhan: And you're Blessed as well.
Brennan: And you're all Blessed as well.
Lou: Kug is not.
"Siobhan: Kug is not, that."
Murph: I did get a 19.
Dupree St. Croix: But then add his thing.
"Murph: Oh no, I got a 19 with him."
Zac: I got a 16.
"Brennan: You got a 16, okay. Esther got a nat 20."
Murph: Yess.
Brennan: Anyone roll for Ox?
"Zac: Oh yes, I forget his stats, here. His dex save is, he's got plus 2, so that's just 1. You add 1 to it."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Zac: He got a 5.
"Brennan: Okay. You each take, 5, 11, You each take 8 points of damage, Ox takes 16 points of damage."
Zac: Ox is down. Turns into a light.
Ox: [barks] [high-pitched] I'll see you later! Bye bye!
"Zac: How, I'm sorry, it took 16 you said."
"Brennan: Yes, or no, you take 8. You take eight, Ox takes 16. Poor Ox! As you—"
Murph: I have to do concentration.
Brennan: Yep.
"Murph: I got War Caster Feat, so I'll roll it with advantage, but it's DC10, right?"
Brennan: Yep.
Murph: I’m good.
Ally: Nice.
Murph: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. Ox vanishes,"
Siobhan: It always feels like a waste when you get two good rolls.
"Brennan: you see that Don Confetti flies up and just goes, [imitates gunshots] and just opens up on your box seat with a gun."
Ricky: Is this part of it?
"Pete: Oh, but people are seeing that, right? Since that's not on stage?"
"Brennan: It looks as though Confetti firing from on stage, you see that one of them goes,"
Audience: Interactive theater!
Brennan: And you see Son—
Misty: Stop talking in the theater! Stop saying things out loud!
Brennan: Sondheim does not escape his grapple.
"Sondheim: Let go of me, I wrote Sweeney Todd!"
"Brennan: You see, Ricky, it's going to be your turn."
"Zac: Okay. I finally think, it finally dawned on Ricky that this is not part of the play."
Brennan: When Ox fully vanishes.
"Zac: And Ricky is like, I think I understand plays. And so Ricky… [laughs] I have a question about Lay on Hands, that's an action, right? Or is it a bonus action?"
"Brennan: Oh, Lay on Hands is an action."
"Zac: Okay. Trying to decide what's better to do, if someone else can heal her. But okay. So Ricky is just going to, just get fully naked."
[Murph laughs really loudly]
Zac: And run onto stage.
Siobhan: Oh my God.
Zac: And run up—
Emily: Now I roll with disadvantage?
Lou: I think we all roll with it.
Emily: If I’m so wet—
"Zac: And grab, and go up to Misty and start body rolling on her."
[Brennan laughs]
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
Zac: Cast Protection from Evil and Good.
Brennan: Ooh.
"Zac: Until the spell ends, one willing creatures, your touch is protected against certain types of creatures including Fae. Protection, they all have to, they all have disadvantage on attack rolls on her."
Ally: Nice.
Brennan: Whoa!
Emily: Whoa!
"Zac: And you can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed."
Murph: Nice.
Ally: That's awesome.
"Brennan: Holy shit! You, something awakens deep in your stomach. Please give me a, because you're body rolling, can you give me a Performance roll with Strength as the ability you're using?"
"Zac: Yes, I very much can. Can I use Athletics or Strength."
Brennan: You can use Athletics.
"Zac: Okay, cool. Still at 11."
"Brennan: Okay, so you're just body rolling, and you see that the theater critic goes,"
"Dupree St. Croix: Mm, no, no, no, this doesn't make any sense at all, why is the male stripper here at the end? I don't see the connection. Perry..."
Zac: Oh can I use a luck point?
"Brennan: Sure, you can use luck point, if you want to re-roll it."
Murph: For body roll?
"Zac: Does this feel, all right, whatever. Okay."
Emily: Yeah!
Zac: 23.
"Brennan: Oh, you see that the critic goes,"
"Dupree St. Croix: Bold, daring, innovative, I love it!"
[Ally clapping]
"Brennan: You see Perry LaFev over in the back, is holding the script going,"
Perry: What the fuck is going on out there? I don't understand! Where is this coming from! Rebecca!
"Brennan: You see that, ah-bup-bup-bum. Ricky, incredible. So you move, you cast that. You jump down there. And that's your action, to cast, any bonus action or no? I don't think you have a bonus action you can take, 'cause you cast a spell already."
"Zac: Yeah, I think that's true."
Brennan: Cool. Great. Buh-buh-bum. Hell yeah. Esther is also going to cast—
"Ally: Oh yeah, Ricky, you're Blessed also."
"Brennan: Esther's going to go ahead and cast Jump on herself as well, she does not want to go on stage. But instead, boom [whooshing] Springs up here into the wings."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Brennan: And—
Ally: What's Esther's deal?
"Brennan: Oh, you see that she has a glowing silvery baseball bat as her Arcane Focus. [shimmering]"
Ally: [unconvincingly] That’s what I was asking.
Siobhan: I don't think that's what he was asking.
"Ally: No, that's what I was asking."
"Brennan: Yeah, that's what you're asking?"
"Ally: [stilted] That's a cool weapon. I would never, it wouldn't work out."
"Zac: I don't even know, I'm just concentrating on my—"
"Ally: Your only secret you've ever had in your life is that you have a crush on her, so."
"Brennan: Incredible. Esther casts Jump. And then you see that she also casts some bonus action spell on herself. Pew! [explosion] And a little bit of circles of light appear around her. Em, if someone could pass me Em."
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: Em, whoosh. [whooshing] Flies all the way here, behind you on stage, reaches out and is going to heal you, Misty, for 16 hit points."
Siobhan: God bless you.
"Brennan: And then, can someone hand me Wally?"
"Murph: Wally, what are you doing, bud?"
"Brennan: Wally's going to rush over here, he's going to jump here, make an Athletics check."
Siobhan: Does Wally also have to do a performance check?
Brennan: Wally sails gracefully through the air.
Ally: Yes!
"Murph, clearly nervous, rubs his brow."
"Brennan: Lands on there. And you see he goes,"
"Wally: [singing very well] That you have but slumbered here, while these visions did appear! Ba-da-da-dah!"
Brennan: And whips his MTA vest off. He's just trying to help. That's gonna go back to Kingston.
Lou: Okay.
Ally: Let's do this!
Lou: I guess I'll hop on stage.
"Brennan: Cool, give me a little Athletics check to clear it up onto there."
"Lou: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This can be 12."
"Brennan: Cool, you make it up."
Lou: Great. And then what are you at now?
"Siobhan: I'm at 59, I'm okay."
"Lou: You're at 59, great."
"Siobhan: I mean, some other kind of help would help."
"Zac: But it's versus checks, right?"
Ally: They are only going for you. Yeah.
"Siobhan: Yeah, that's true, but I mean, my hit point max is 66."
"Lou: Okay, great."
Siobhan: So.
Ally: Are you the only one who can give Bardic?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Ally: [whispering] Dang.
Lou: Great.
Siobhan: And I can't give it to myself.
"Misty: Sondheim, give me Bardic Inspiration!"
[Ally and Siobhan laugh]
"Lou: I'm gonna step off into the wings here, and then I will cast Bless again as a second level spell, giving it to one, two, three, and four."
"Brennan: Woo, baby. Cool. Go ahead and move your figure behind the curtains."
Murph: Was that me or Pete you put it on?
Lou: It was Pete.
Murph: Fuck.
"Lou: Do you need, do you have—"
Murph: Whatever.
Zac: Are we all Blessed now?
Lou: No.
"Zac: Oh, okay."
"Ally: You can Bless Kugrash over me if you want, 'cause I can always do Bend Luck."
Lou: Sick. [points to Murph] My man.
"Murph: [two thumbs up] Yeah, thanks."
Ally: To give myself a d4 if it's really important.
"Brennan: Okay, cool. So Blesses all the way around. That is now, that's Kingston's turn. Kugrash, that's you."
"Murph: Okay. Buh-buh-bah. How can I help Misty here? All right. I think, ah. All right, the fighters are up in there, I got Don Confetti up here. Don Confetti looks like he's got a spell cast on him, right?"
"Brennan: He does, yeah."
Murph: Okay. I would like to cast Dispel Magic--
"Ally: Yeah, fuck yeah."
Murph: On Don Confetti.
Brennan: Ooh baby. Go ahead--
"Murph: So yeah, it's a, any spell third level or lower on the target ends--"
Siobhan: You should do it on the magical effect and not on the creature.
"Murph: Right, oh yeah. I'm trying to do it on the magical effect. Whatever is going on with Don."
Ally: With Don and all of 'em.
Murph: Yeah.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Murph: So the DC equals 10 plus the spell's level. And I do, ability check using your spellcasting ability. So that's, okay, my spellcasting. So it's just Wisdom. So it's a plus 5, 10 plus whatever the spell level is."
"Brennan: So I'm gonna need you to make a spell attack, I'm gonna need you to make your spellcasting attack, basically."
"Murph: Okay. I think it's not spellcasting attack, I think it says just spellcasting--"
Brennan: Make an ability check using your Spell Casting.
"Murph: Yeah, so I think it's just plus 5. It's just my wisdom."
Brennan: It's just your wisdom plus five.
Murph: [extra-gravelly Kug voice] Come on!
Ally: And you're blessed.
Zac: And you’re blessed.
"Murph: And I'm blessed, do I get to, I don't think I get to use that now."
"Brennan: Not to this, no."
Murph: Come on!
[hand slaps on table]
Murph: 2!
[Brennan imitates explosion]
Murph: Fuck! What a waste.
Brennan: It does not work on the Don.
"Murph: [sighs] There's nothing really I can do as a bonus action either, 'cause that's a spell, I'm up there by myself. I'll just jump down there and I'll go, I'll go stand next to my boy Wally."
"Brennan: Okay. So you're gonna go jump on stage, right?"
Murph: I'll go jump on stage.
Brennan: I'm gonna need a Performance check from you.
"Murph: Goddamn it, can I do acrobatics?"
"Brennan: [laughs] Yes, you can do acrobatics."
Murph: I'd like to do some rat rolls--
"Brennan: Yes, you can do, you can do some acrobatics."
Murph: Okay.
Siobhan: Also fully nude.
Murph: [singing] Deh-deh-deh-deh! Give me a break! Goddamn it!
"Brennan: Nat 1, you—"
Siobhan: Can’t you add Bardic Inspiration or Blessed.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
Murph: I got a nat 1.
Brennan: Nat 1's auto fail.
Murph: He’s gonna fuckin' punish me.
"Brennan: Cool. Kugrash face plants,"
Ally: He’s gonna punish me?
"Brennan: Kugrash, I'm gonna say you face plant on the stage, and your little rat body tumbles, and you let out a nasty blast of a fart, as you just, [imitates flatulence] and blow off a little bit."
"Kugrash: Ah, ah, shit."
Brennan: You see that everyone in the theater screams. [shrieks] And they scream as loud as they can.
"Emily: Oh no, rats are so bad! Rats are, people don't like rats!"
Murph: I thought it was magic when I was on the stage!
Emily: Oh no!
Zac: You turn into some—
"Lou: Yeah, doesn't he look like a hairy baby?"
"Brennan: Yeah, they're all seeing a hairy baby."
"Emily: That’s true, yeah, yeah, yeah, a hairy baby!"
"Lou: I hate this farting, hairy baby."
Brennan: Absolutely hate it.
"Emily: Instead of my attack, I'm gonna go to your hair."
"Lou: We'll go backstage, get right, then come back out here."
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: What a bad turn. Just a legendary bad turn. Just...
"Ally: Aww! You tried, that's what's important."
Emily: You tried. Don’t feel bad.
Lou: You put a lot of effort in in the right ways.
Ally: Yeah.
"Emily: Don't feel bad, it was the dice that made it a bad turn."
"Brennan: Kugrash, Pete, Wally, Esther, Kingston."
Siobhan: Sofia?
Brennan: Sofia.
Emily: I'm right here.
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys are—"
Zac: Ricky?
"Brennan: One, two, three, four, five, six, yeah."
Zac: Ricky too?
"Brennan: Ricky as well. Titania goes to cast a spell. She is casting a powerful charm spell, I'm gonna need—"
Zac: You're immune to charm right now.
"Siobhan: I am immune, I don't know if I'm immune to charm."
Zac: Protection From Evil and Good.
"Siobhan: Oh yes, I am immune to charm. I would also like to try and Counterspell again."
"Zac: Wait, actually, everyone within 10 feet of me can't be charmed."
Murph: Whoa.
Brennan: Can't be charmed?
Zac: Aura of Devotion.
"Emily: Oh, I am within 10 feet of you!"
"Brennan: Hold on one sec, let me just double check."
"Emily: Oh, Titania."
"Zac: Starting at seventh level, you and friendly creatures—"
Brennan: Can't be charmed while you're conscious!
[Emily claps]
Brennan: Holy shit! This is very good for a faerie fight!
"Emily: Take it, Titania! Take it!"
"Brennan: These bod, you see that Titania looks at you and says,"
"Titania: Human boy. Come live with me in Faerie Land. Look at those abs, you have abs on the side. What the hell is—"
Ricky: These are from going this way. [mimes lifting]
"Brennan: She is still going to cast a spell, so you can, you and all the people are going to be immune to it, but you can try to Counterspell—"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I mean, I'm going to give it a go."
Brennan: Go for it. Give me that Counterspell.
"Siobhan: Nat 20, baby."
Brennan’s jaw drops.
[cheers]
Ally: Yeah! Thank God!
Brennan: Holy shit!
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: You see that she goes,"
"Titania: Human boy,"
"Brennan: And tries towards all of you, Misty, you bat the fuckin' spell out of here."
Misty: Get the fuck away from my friends!
"Murph: Kug, I think your bad turn was outdone. By Titania herself."
"Brennan: You see, in response to that, Titania raises up in the air, and--"
"Emily: Again, this is only good for it looking like an awesome play."
"Siobhan: Yeah, this is some Spider-Man: Turn Back The Dark shit."
Emily: But no one's getting hurt.
"Siobhan: Right, yet!"
"Brennan: You hear, you see that she turns to cast more magic at you, and you hear Perry going,"
"Perry: Cheat out! Cheat out, cheat out!"
Brennan: And she's going to make another attack at you.
Siobhan: She has a second spell attack?
Brennan: She has a powerful spell on her that lets her make spell attacks as a bonus action.
Siobhan: That bitch.
Zac: Is this—
"Brennan: Crown of Stars, look it up. Miss, she… [laughing]"
Murph: Look it up.
"Ally: Fuckin' look at, read a book!"
Siobhan: Read a book.
Zac: Is this just an attack roll?
Brennan: It's just an attack roll.
Zac: She has disadvantage on that.
Brennan: Really?
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: This is Protection From Evil and Good. [holds out the spell card]
"Brennan: Yeah, oh, she is Fae, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Dude, this fuckin' spell."
"Ally: It's great, great job, Ricky."
"Murph: Just fuck you, man!"
Zac does a little body roll dance.
Ally: We're playing smart!
Brennan: She misses.
Ally: Yes!
Brennan: Boom! [magical explosion]
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: That's Titania, Pete, that's your turn."
"Ally: That's right, bitch. I step forward in front of the cockroach. And I cast Fireball on Titania."
Brennan: Ooh!
"Ally: [pops lips] Let's see. 150 feet, yeah, we’re close. I cast it as a fourth level. She makes a Dex saving throw."
"Brennan: Cool, you're casting that on Titania. She makes a dex saving throw. Hold on one second. Buh-buh-bum. You see that she… Dispels it. [magical tinkling] Counters it. Pew."
"Titania: No, no, no. Little human boy, do you want to come and feed me grapes in Faerie Land?"
"Pete: No, Jesus! Shut up!"
Brennan: Give me a Wild Magic roll.
"Ally: Oh yeah, for sure. 18."
Brennan: Woo!
"Ally: Okay, then I am going to… Freakin' run. I'm going to run so I'm not all clumped up anymore. Kinda like straight backstage, or just as far as I--"
Brennan: As backstage as you can get?
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and start moving your movement, and I'm going to need a Performance check as you're moving across the stage."
"Ally: Oh, you got it. What is that?"
Brennan: Just charisma.
"Ally: Charisma, oh, I have good charisma, I think."
"Brennan: Yeah, plus 5."
"Ally: Plus 8, oh no. Yeah, yeah. Plus five, plus five."
"Siobhan: Yeah, the—"
"Ally: 13, 12."
Siobhan: Would you get proficiency?
"Brennan: 12\. Pete has not gotten a costume or anything, so Pete's just in his zebra cowboy hat."
"Siobhan: But you do have, oh no, you don't have this."
"Brennan: So yeah, Pete. Go ahead and move your figure."
Ally: Can you guys scoot it back? Just going straight back.
"Emily: How much am I moving? One, two, three, four. What is it. I think it's six."
Brennan: Cool. You duck behind the curtain back there?
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, just behind the curtain. That's fine, thank you!"
"Brennan: Dope. You get out of harm's way. Cool. That is going to be, these guys vanish behind the curtains, so you cannot actually see these guys, 'cause no one's got eyes behind the curtain."
Ally: I'm behind the curtain though.
"Brennan: No, you're behind the drawn curtains. But remember, we had to pull it for the thing."
Ally: Got it.
Brennan: There's a big thing behind there. So the pixies disappear with Sondheim.
Siobhan: [laughs] God.
Murph: Is Stephen Sondheim gonna die?
"Zac: I think, is she gonna take him to Faerie?"
Murph: [gasps] Shit!
"Siobhan: God, have we got to rescue Stephen Sondheim from Faerie?"
"Emily: Do we need to, I mean, I felt like I--"
"Murph: We gotta rescue Misty, too. We gotta--"
"Siobhan: I mean, between me and Sondheim, get Sondheim!"
Brennan: Cool!
"Emily: Really, 'cause I'm—"
Siobhan: All right.
"Murph: I'll get Sondheim, because I'm useless on stage."
"Brennan: Misty, it is your turn."
Siobhan: Mm-hmm?
Brennan: I don't believe you took any damage last turn.
Siobhan: I did not.
Murph: I don't think you did.
"Brennan: Okay, so the difficulty is only being raised by two for failed Performance checks on stage. You have to elevate those performers while they're on stage gumming up the works next to you."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: So the only, Sofia succeeded."
Zac: I succeeded.
"Brennan: Ricky succeeded. Only, actually let me roll for Em real quick. Em actually succeeds, she just looks like a cool piece of production design. The cockroach and Kugrash failed. Wally actually succeeded. So the DC for this is 14."
Siobhan: Great.
[whooshing]
Ally: What was the success for…
"Siobhan: Oh, and I have Bardic now."
Brennan: Hm?
Ally: What was the success for Performance?
"Zac: Oh, you have—"
"Siobhan: I mean, yeah."
Brennan: What was whose success for Performance?
Ally: What was the DC for Performance check?
Brennan: The DC for performance to not fuck up Misty is 15.
"Ally: Oh, then I failed too."
"Brennan: Oh, you failed as well. Okay, so it's going to be 16."
Zac: You didn't add anything to that?
"Siobhan: [to Ally, mockingly] Do we have homework tonight?"
Ally: [laughing] Sorry.
"Brennan: All right, so we're rolling two dice. You need to beat a 16."
"Ally: Okay. Now that I know how it works, I'll reroll on those."
Murph: What?
Emily: What?
Lou: With a Bless?
Siobhan: With a Bless I got 10.
"Brennan: No no, you add your Performance to it."
"Siobhan: Oh, I add my Performance to it?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Oh, plus 11!"
"Brennan: Oh, then you succeed."
Emily: Oh yay!
Zac: Did you succeed last time?
Emily: Because last time was 28.
Siobhan: It was 28.
"Murph: One, one."
Emily: Last time it was 16.
Zac: Yeah.
Ally: Oh yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. These two little mobsters over here are gonna go, they're each gonna take shots at Misty, what's your, your armour, I know your armor class. It’s 14. I'm gonna need two Constitution saving throws."
"Ally: So that's one save, right?"
"Siobhan: Oh yes, thank you."
Ally: We did have homework.
"Siobhan: Ah, all right. Well, I'll think about forgiving you."
"Ally: We did, we actually did. [laughs]"
Siobhan: Ah fuck. That is a 7.
Emily: Aren't you Blessed?
Lou: You are Blessed.
[suspenseful music]
"Siobhan: Oh sorry, a… Two Constitution saving throws, so one of them is 3, 7, 9, and then one of them is 5, 7, 9 and 10."
"Brennan: Nine and 10, okay. Firstly--"
"Zac: How do you get, is it a saving throw? You get to add 3 to it?"
"Brennan: We didn't, I'm sorry. The saving throw you add 3 to, also these guys are Fae, so sorry, there's a lot of math going on right now. Let me actually roll—"
Siobhan: Oh God!
"Brennan: I'm gonna roll to see if these guys… Okay, one of them does still hit, even with the protection."
Zac: Are they just attacking her?
Brennan: They're just attacking.
Zac: Can I also make my attack on them from Sentinel?
"Brennan: They're ranged attacks, so it's these guys up here."
"Zac: Oh those guys, excuse me."
Siobhan: This guy is under Hypnotic Pattern.
"Brennan: Oh, he is!"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: We've totally botched all of this! None of this happens, they both miss, everything is good!"
[tense music stops]
Siobhan: Great!
Murph: Great!
"Brennan: Cool! Good! It's good, because they both went before you anyway, but none of it would have mattered."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: [to the camera] D&D has a lot going on. Okay.
Siobhan: Complicated. A lot of arithmetic.
"Brennan: One failure, one success in the ritual."
[Ally whistles]
Brennan: That is going to be these Seelie.
"Siobhan: Wait, I haven't gone!"
"Brennan: You haven't even gone, your turn, that's right, thank you, yes, yes, yes."
"Siobhan: So what I would like to do is cast Puppet on Titania, which is a Constitution saving throw. And on a failed save, the target must move up to its speed in a direction you choose. In addition, and let me see if you will let me do this, Brennan."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: You can cause the target to drop whatever it's holding, so I would love for her to drop that beautiful crown that is on her head."
Brennan: Ooh! I would be very down to allow that. She's making a Constitution save. She does have advantage against spells.
Siobhan: Great. Love it.
"Brennan: Let's see how she fares, she's gotta beat a 16. Constitution is not her best score. She succeeds."
"Siobhan: Well, you know what? It was worth a try."
Ally: She's so fucking powerful.
Brennan: She's fucking Titania! She's Queen of the Fairies!
Emily: Don't you remember when she tried to cast that big spell? Fuckin' failed.
"Ally: Yeah, true."
"Siobhan: And then I would like to Misty Step to the other side of Ricky, so I'm still within his Aura of Protection, but I'm not surrounded by all of these Fae creatures."
Emily: Sounds like right here.
[whooshing]
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Awesome.
Zac: Bet it looked cool.
"Brennan: And you, you see, cool. And you see that you're so, you're surrounded, you didn't take any damage. Some other bad things happened, you fully teleport in a flash of light and hit the fuckin' high note."
Siobhan: I throw a smoke bomb for—
"Brennan: [laughs] You have real magic, but you also are throwing smoke bombs just to add a little bit of extra spice."
"Siobhan: I just, we want to give it some momentum."
"Emily: So if this person tries to go attack her, will I get an attack of opportunity on them?"
"Brennan: Yeah, if anyone leaves your threatened area, yes, absolutely."
"Siobhan: Am I still, do I have to be within five feet of you, or within 10 feet of you?"
"Zac: To get 10 feet, so if you go five feet forward—"
Siobhan: Oh fuck.
"Brennan: Yeah, I might move—"
Emily: Mr. Confetti!
"Brennan: If you, actually, even though that aura's very good, I will also say that things could move to, no actually yeah, that's great. Nevermind, yeah."
"Siobhan: Cause if they, if they move towards me now, both Ricky and Sofia get opportunity attacks?"
"Brennan: Unless, Sofia would. Ricky will only get it if they don't, if they leave his threatened area. So they could move—"
Siobhan: But he has Sentinel. So if they move—
Zac: If they attack her.
"Brennan: If they attack, yes. Then you get attacks on them, that's correct."
"Siobhan: Okay, great."
"Brennan: Cool. You, [imitates explosion]. You know, [sings] That you have but slumbered here, pow! [normal] You appear, that's your bonus action. Your action, that's going to be, yeah, that's gonna be the Seelie. Cool. So this one, first of all, isn't going to move without leaving Ricky's threatened area. This one does leave."
Emily: Woo!
Brennan: Sofia's.
"Emily: Okay. It's probably gonna hit, so I'm not gonna add anything to it yet. But. Okay, does a 28 hit."
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure."
Emily: Okay. [laughs] 10.
Murph: Nice.
Brennan: Ooh!
Emily: Can I use my bonus when I'm getting an attack of opportunity?
"Brennan: No, it's just one attack."
"Emily: Okay, so it's just that one attack, all right."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: I can't use a ki point to add an extra Flurry of Blows or something?
"Brennan: No, you can't, you could use a ki point to do Stunning Strike."
"Emily: Stunning Strike, okay, I'll do Stunning Strike."
"Brennan: Cool. And the DC on that is 14, it's a Constitution save, correct?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Nat 1. You see it, this person, this person goes to attack, and instead you roundhouse kick this Elven warrior right in the head. [impact] She, [imitates grogginess]. Is extremely stunned 'til the end of your next turn."
Emily: Nice.
"Brennan: Wild. Those two move over here. This one's going to try to avoid Ricky, so five, ten, fifteen."
Siobhan: Doesn't she leave Em's—
"Brennan: Yeah, she does, so Em's gonna take a swipe and move over here to you."
[dramatic music]
Brennan: Em misses.
Siobhan: Dang it.
"Brennan: This one, I actually don't think can get to you. Unless it goes through Ricky, so this one's—"
"Emily: Is that leaving, don't I get an attack, oh, I already—"
"Brennan: You only use your reaction. So Ricky, you do get an attack opportunity on this one here that's moving past you."
"Zac: Mkay, I will swing. That is 20-something."
Brennan: You definitely hit.
"Zac: All right, cool."
"Murph: Get ‘em, Rick."
Zac: Then I'll do 1d8.
Ally: Do you—
Siobhan: Still fully naked. Dick fully out on stage.
Lou: So wild.
Zac: Yes. And I'd like to Divine Smite as well.
Murph: Nice.
Zac: So that was 5 plus… 7. 2. So 5.
"Siobhan: 19, 17?"
"Zac: 7, 2, 5… 14?"
"Brennan: 7, 2, and 5 is 14. You wallop that Seelie, and stop it in its tracks with Sentinel, preventing it from closing in."
Emily: Woo!
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: Incredible. Yeah, your two warrior buddies got your back. Whoa, bah, bah, bah! [impacts] You see that the critic from the New York Times says,"
"Dupree St. Croix: The fight choreography in what I had presumed would be a violence-less play, is really stunning, incredible work."
"Brennan: They are set, but two of them are gonna get attacks at disadvantage against Misty."
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: Ooh, that's not very good. At all."
"Ally: Or just one, right? 'Cause isn't one of them getting to her but not attacking?"
"Brennan: No, one of them, the two of them are getting with the ability to attack."
"Siobhan: Ah, whichever one succeeded against me."
"Brennan: The, are you gonna subtract from this attack?"
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: Okay, cool. Go ahead and roll your Cutting Words."
[suspenseful music]
Siobhan: That is a 4.
"Brennan: That prevents the hit, yep."
Siobhan: Oh God.
Brennan: Another one attacks.
Lou: [fanning himself] Oh God.
"Brennan: Okay, one of them runs up, Misty, and deals you..."
Murph: Shit.
Brennan: 20 points of damage.
Siobhan: Goddamn.
Ally: Do you have the juicy cockroach added to your health?
Siobhan: I do.
Ally: 'Cause it's right next to you.
"Brennan: Cool. That's the Seelie. Incredible, that's now going to be Sofia."
Emily: Okay. I'm just gonna--
Siobhan: Don't forget you still have Bardic if you need it.
"Emily: Fuck up this person in front of me. And since she's stunned, I have advantage on all my attacks."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll.
Murph: Nice.
"Emily: First one is going to be, I'm guessing 21 hits, so I'm not gonna use my Bardic. Oh wait, actually. I'm guessing 25 hits."
Brennan: 25 does hit.
"Emily: Okay. [clears throat] It's gonna be 9, second one. It's gonna be, it was definitely gonna hit. It's gonna be 28, and then… Just 6. How's she looking?"
"Brennan: Okay. So now you're rolling damage for these, right?"
"Emily: Oh no, that's the damage, I just, oh sorry, I just sufficiently rolled the—"
Brennan: Got you. How much damage did you over-roll?
"Emily: I think it was 9 and then 6, so 15 so far?"
"Brennan: 9 and then 6. She drops on 9, dead."
"Emily: Oh okay, so can I then actually, 'cause I'm gonna Flurry of Blows, can I use a disengage so then use the rest of my attack?"
"Brennan: You don't even have to disengage, no one's threatening you right now."
"Emily: Oh, okay! So I'm gonna go over to this person."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Emily: And then do an attack on, do my second attack on them."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: This should be looking really bad. [laughs]
Emily: Does a 20 hit?
"Brennan: A 20 does hit, yes."
Emily: Okay. So that's gonna be 7.
Brennan: Okay.
"Emily: And then I'm gonna Flurry of Blows. Oh that is, they're both gonna hit."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: And then--
Zac: Is that a 19?
"Siobhan: A 19 crits, doesn't it?"
Ally: 19 crits.
"Emily: No, no, no, no, that's when, that's if I do my Hexblade."
"Ally: Oh, right."
"Emily: So that's, So I do another, 14."
Brennan: 14? Another 14 damage to the one there?
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You drop two of the Seelie in one round. Sofia, whoa! [impacts]"
Emily: Whoa!
"Brennan: I'm gonna need a Performance, dex, or an Acrobatics."
[Emily clears throat]
"Ally: You have Bardic, I think?"
"Emily: I don't even need it, I'm saving it for when I need it, I got a 30."
"Brennan: You see one extremely big guy in the back of the house that was not excited about coming to this premier, but he sees like, got a big coat on, and was clearly would rather see an action movie, goes, [screaming]"
"Audience: [yelling] Woo! Broadway rules, dude! Broadway fuckin' rules! I love the theater!"
"Brennan: Yeah, that is an incredible acrobatic success. This one fuckin' drops. Sofia, incredible turn. Oh, this one that you stopped, I just realized, you don't stun them, you just stop them, so that one is gonna take a swing on you."
Zac: All right.
"Brennan: And is going to hit. Which is going to deal you... 12, 13, 17 points of damage. I'm gonna need a Constitution saving throw."
"Emily: So can I go back to do one thing? So since I did my Flurry of Blows, I actually get the disengage, so I'm gonna disengage from there and be right next to this person."
"Brennan: Awesome, great."
"Zac: Okay. That was 17, you said? 11..."
"Brennan: That's a success, yeah."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: So you hold on to your protection, but you do take 17 points of damage."
"Zac: All right, cool."
Brennan: That's going to be—
Zac: I'm at 71.
"Brennan: [laughs] That's gonna be, that's the Seelie, Sofia just went, that's awesome."
"Siobhan: Oh, I haven't been rolling for my concentration."
"Brennan: Oh for you, what spell do you have?"
Siobhan: So I'll do it right now. I have Hypnotic Pattern on just the one guy.
"Brennan: Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah, go for it."
"Emily: [to Zac] Oh, Protection from Good and Evil is concentration?"
Lou: You’re Blessed.
"Siobhan: Do I add my, oh yeah. I'm fine. Yeah. 10."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: 10.
"Brennan: Even when he, but you're trying to beat a 13, so you took 26 points of damage."
"Siobhan: Oh wait, plus my Constitution?"
"Brennan: Yeah, plus your Constitution modifier. Do you beat a 13?"
"Zac: Oh hey, plus 3, right?"
"Siobhan: Oh, plus 3."
"Brennan: Plus three, yeah."
"Siobhan: So plus, yeah, absolutely, I get 15."
"Brennan: Cool, cool, cool. You're holding on to your spell just fine. That's awesome. Cool."
[suspenseful music]
Brennan: Don Confetti is going to drop down and make an attack on Misty.
"Misty: Fuck! Don, we've been such good old friends!"
Zac: And it is with disadvantage.
"Brennan: It is a disadvantage, that's correct. I can't believe how good Protection From Good and Evil is."
Siobhan: It's great. Thank God.
Brennan: And misses.
Emily: Woo!
"Brennan: And then he goes ahead,"
Ally: That’s great.
"Brennan: But is a little bit lower in elevation now. That's going to be… You hear the noise of Stephen Sondheim struggling with the pixies in the back. [grunting, struggle] And that's going to be Ricky."
"Zac: Ricky is going to, huh."
Emily: There's two Seelies still there.
"Zac: There's the one, okay, so I'll—"
Ally: There's a Seelie right next to you in the—
"Zac: Can I take an attack on this one, then take a five foot step between the two, does that make sense?"
"Brennan: You can move between your attack and your extra attack, yes."
"Zac: So I will just attack, how hurt are you?"
Siobhan: I'm at 39.
Zac: Does it feel like someone's gonna heal you before the next--
Lou: I can do it.
Siobhan: I'll be fine.
"Zac: All right, I'm just gonna attack the one in front of me. So first."
[suspenseful music]
Zac: A 15.
Brennan: That's a definite hit.
"Zac: Bless. And then, oh. Even better."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Okay, so for the first one that's, I'll do Divine Smite on that person as well. So that's, can I have one of your d8’s?"
"Emily: Yeah. Oh, right here."
"Zac: Cool. So this is the first attack. So this is 8, 7, 2, so 17?"
"Brennan: 17\. Cool. Badly hurt, 17 damage, badly hurt."
"Zac: Okay, and then I'll just do a regular attack and decide if I Divine Smite after."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: So that's… oh, I didn't even add the 8. Just the flat 8 as well. So 17 plus 8."
"Brennan: Oh, in that case you drop that Seelie on the first attack, boom."
Zac: Great.
Emily: Another Seelie. Seelie clean up.
Zac: And then I'm gonna move over to the other one. Under Don Confetti.
Brennan: Cool.
[suspenseful music]
"Zac: And attack that guy. Which, yeah okay. That's a 20."
"Brennan: 20 hits, yeah."
"Zac: Okay, cool. Then… So that's, I hit him for…14."
Brennan: Okay.
Zac: And I guess I'll Divine Smite.
"Brennan: Cool. Burning through those spells, yeah."
Zac: So that's another 12 on top of that.
"Brennan: Cool, he's looking fucked up."
"Zac: That, and I can't use a bonus action, right? 'Cause is Divine Smite a bonus action?"
"Brennan: Bonus, Divine Smite is not a bonus action, so you can use a bonus action."
Zac: As a bonus action I'll use Sanctuary.
Brennan: Is Sanctuary concentration?
Zac: It is not.
Zac hands Brennan Sanctuary’s spell card.
Brennan: Whoa!
"Zac: According to this card, at least."
"Brennan: Very, wow. Ricky protecting the health."
"Siobhan: You know what, gotta pay it forward. I've been saving Ricky so many times."
Ricky: I am paying it back.
"Brennan: Incredible turn from Ricky. Awesome. Fuck it. You see, it is now—"
Misty: I'm just so inspired by that beautiful penis!
Zac: The whole crowd is!
Misty: Jiggling around the stage!
Brennan: Wally—
Misty: [dancing] How has his penis got abs?
"Brennan: Wally makes another successful performance check and moves next to Misty to start harmonizing with Misty. Em rushes forward to Misty, and is going to heal you for…11 hit points."
Ally: Nice.
"Brennan: Esther runs over here out of sight of where everyone is, but you see her flatten herself to the catwalk, hold out her baseball bat, and blast Titania with a Lightning Bolt."
[thunderclap]
Siobhan: Sick.
Emily: Woo!
Ally: Whoa. And it's not countered or anything?
Brennan: Titania's already used her counter this round.
Murph: So are we looking to save Sondheim?
Lou: I'm gonna run back.
Ally: I’m on my way.
Siobhan: Save Sondheim?
Lou: On my next one.
Emily: I feel like I'm on Misty duty.
Murph: Yeah.
Zac: Me too.
Ally: I'm halfway back there.
"Murph: 'Cause I can,"
"Zac: What a great, what are we talking about?"
Murph: Save Sondheim.
Lou: Who's on Sondheim duty?
Zac: Are we trying to save Stephen Sondheim from these faeries?
"Murph: Brennan, does Wally have any movement to scoop his dad and run him towards Sondheim if—"
"Brennan: If Kugrash wanted it? Yeah, he could actually, instead of singing, if you look at that, Wally goes like,"
"Wally: Dad, we're in a musical!"
"Kugrash: Yeah! You know Stephen Sondheim, right?"
Wally: [singing] I dreamed a dream in times gone by!
"Kugrash: Yeah, we gotta go save his life!"
Wally: What?
Kugrash: You gotta go run me back!
Sofia: Is that Sondheim?
Misty shakes her head at Sofia. It is not Sondheim; Les Mis’ music is by Claude-Michael Schönberg.
Wally: Okay!
Kugrash: Pick up your dad!
"Wally: No, you know, like [sings] Hakuna Matata! With Sondheim!"
"Sofia: Yeah, you're so good, kid!"
Kugrash: We gotta help the Lion King!
"Wally: I love you, Mufasa!"
Brennan: He rushes you back here.
Kugrash: Mufasa's fine.
"Brennan: You rush back past Pete, you see Alissa, Misty's assistant saying,"
"Alissa: Is everything all right? Does she need a coffee, what's going on out there?"
Kugrash: Everything's good!
"Brennan: Cool. You rush back there, Esther blasts Titania with a Lightning Bolt. And I think actually, she can nail the guy behind him too. No, that guy dodges. That is now going to be back to Kingston."
Lou: What are you at now?
Siobhan: I'm at 50.
"Lou: 50, great. Oh, what a dream!"
Murph: I think I can get to Sondheim.
"Lou: You got Sondheim, great."
[Emily laughs]
Murph: I got Sondheim.
"Lou: Guys, we have, I mean, we're nailing it. I guess, let me try and hit, I'll try and hit Titania with a Guiding Bolt."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
Lou: It's gonna be 18.
Brennan: 18 hits.
"Lou: Great. Great, great, great. Great, great."
[suspenseful music]
Siobhan: [whispering] Fuck yes.
Lou: 17\. And then next attack on her has advantage.
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: Ohh! You reach up a hand. [explosion] Light erupts from backstage. Titania shrieks in pain. Yeah, badly hurt. And then, are you staying in position, or are you moving?"
Lou: I'll wait for Kug. Can I make an Insight check on Alissa?
Brennan: Sure.
Lou: Great. Nat 1.
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: Alissa seems pretty useless to you.
"Lou: Great, good, good."
"Brennan: Kugrash, that's you, baby."
"Murph: All right. I guess I'm, at first I'm gonna use my movement to see how, 'cause there's a curtain here, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, right behind the trees."
"Murph: Great, so I would like to get behind the trees and see what's going on here."
"Brennan: So, but you want to get behind the curtain, in other words?"
"Murph: Yeah, behind the curtain, before I use any more movement or anything. Just take the five or ten feet, whatever it takes."
Brennan: Cool. How are you getting back there? You're just running back there?
Murph: Running back there.
"Brennan: Two pixies open fire if you run back there, they're ready to action."
Murph: But Sondheim's free?
"Brennan: Sondheim is slumped against a bunch of boxes. It looks like they just, when the fight broke out, grabbed Stephen Sondheim, started kicking the shit out of him."
"Kugrash: Stephen Sondheim, are you all right?"
"Brennan: You see Stephen Sondheim says,"
"Sondheim: Listen, I've had worse from the New Yorker, you know what I'm talking about?"
"Kugrash: [laughs] That wit, that wit! We're gonna die, bud!"
Sofia: Tell him I love Into the Woods!
Kugrash: Sofia loves Into the Woods.
"Brennan: Incredible. Yeah, one pixie's actually gonna take a swing at you."
Kugrash: My son loves The Lion King! We're huge fans of your work!
Sondheim: I did not make that. I had nothing to do with that.
Kugrash: We watched your movie. It was really good!
Sondheim: That's Sir Elton John and wasn't it Tim Rice?
Kugrash: Yeah!
"Brennan: You see that, takes a swing. That guy misses. Next guy, next pixie hits. I'm gonna need a Constitution saving throw."
"Murph: [laughs] Hmm, 6."
Lou: You're Blessed.
"Murph: Oh, I am Blessed, it's probably not gonna help too much."
Lou: Well.
"Zac: Are you, no you're not."
Murph: 9.
"Brennan: 9? Okay, you take 10 points of damage."
Murph: Good.
"Brennan: As one of them shoots you with a gun, and you are poisoned."
"Murph: Good! Oh, I'm immune to being poisoned."
"Brennan: Oh, you're a dirty little rat!"
Murph: A dirty little rat!
"Emily: Ooohhh, he’s a rat all the time!"
"Brennan: You are not poisoned! So just, whap!"
Siobhan: So let's turn around and poison them!
Murph: I actually have resistance to poison damage. I don't know if any other damage—
"Brennan: Oh, no this was not poison damage. It was just with a gun, and then poison addition. Cool, but you use 10 feet of movement to get within range. They hit you, and--"
Murph: And they're just standing there.
"Brennan: They're just standing there, yeah."
"Murph: Okay, okay. So one guy's right on top of me."
"Brennan: And this is past, now you're just back in regular New York, 'cause this is a big curtain here, so the audience, you're not fucking with the ritual at all if you're going to get back here."
"Murph: Good, I'm better behind the curtain. Let's see here, okay. I got that one guy there."
Emily: He's an excellent stage hand.
"Murph: Excellent, that—"
"Siobhan: Oh my God, you'd be such a good stage hand."
"Murph: Yeah, thank you."
Siobhan: All dark and wriggling. [mimes tugging on curtains] Pulling things.
"Murph: Let's see. Okay, you know what? Maybe I'll summon my rats."
Ally: Yeah!
"Murph: I'm gonna go ahead and use my, oh wait, no rats aren't gonna be any good against these fuckin' flying dudes. Motherfuckers."
Ally: Can you summon wasps?
Emily: Pigeons? Bumblebees?
"Murph: I can summon, I can Conjure Animals, but I can't pick what they are."
"Siobhan: Real slow, buzzing around, going for flowers. They're not attacking anybody because it hurts them to do that."
"Lou: It's just a bunch of, yeah, they just fly up to the fake trees."
Siobhan: Make some honey.
Murph: I'm just gonna do Thunder Wave on this guy right in front of me.
Brennan: Dope. Go ahead and cast the spell.
"Murph: Cool, I'm gonna do it at a third level, 'cause why not."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: Okay, so 4d8. 9, 16 damage."
Ally: Nice.
Brennan: 16 damage?
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: You, pew. [magical explosion] Blast, he's fuckin' dead. Little homie."
Murph: Nice.
Ally: Nice. Fuck yeah.
Lou: Wasn't that the little homie?
"Brennan: Little homie's gone! He's like,"
"Pixie: Oh, [Italian-esque swearing]— Aah!"
[Brennan imitates explosion]
Kugrash: Go to hell!
"Brennan: That's Kugrash, that's your first—"
"Kugrash: That's for Sondheim, you son of a bitch! He made my son's second favorite movie, The Lion King!"
"Sondheim: I had nothing to do with that, again, I need to be very clear."
"Kugrash: Modest, you're modest!"
Brennan: Cool! You blast that pixie back. That's now going to be… Titania.
"[deep, ominous music]"
Brennan: Ooh baby.
"Siobhan: This, did your spells already give advantage to the person attacking, or disadvantage to her?"
Lou: Person attacking gets advantage.
Siobhan: Okay.
Lou: I wish I could have done more.
"Siobhan: No, you did great."
Brennan: Hold on.
"Lou: It's amped out here, my heart is racing."
"Murph: I rolled concentration on the fire, by the way, and I passed. Even though it doesn't really matter. I don't, the fire's done."
Lou: A big Wall of Fire just holding it down.
Murph: The fire did its job. But it's still there.
"Emily: I know, but someone might get thrown into that. Treacherous terrain."
"Murph: Yeah, if you want, throw somebody in the fire. It's still there. Something's happening."
"Siobhan: Yeah, so he's doing a lot of math and lines."
"Murph: Don't worry though, Stephen Sondheim is okay."
Zac: I don't know.
Lou: As long as Sondheim is alive. Sondheim's alive!
"Brennan: Um… Yeah. Titania moves back all the way, yeah, all the way back here, in fact, you know what? She's actually going to take a little trip up."
Lou: My girl. Everybody's flying today.
Brennan: Faeries! [laughs]
Zac: Yay!
[whistling wind]
Lou: That's high.
Siobhan: Spectacular! Spectacular.
"Brennan: You guys see, I'm going to need Kingston, Pete, Ricky, Sofia, and Misty to all make Constitution saving throws. She's actually got to, she's got to pass a Wisdom saving throw to be able to hurt Misty 'cause of Sanctuary."
"Zac: Should we wait for that, or—"
"Brennan: Yeah, wait for that."
"Zac: Wait, unless it's a, is it, it doesn't matter if it's an area of effect spell?"
"Brennan: Area of effect would prevent her from casting it to hurt Misty, but unfortunately she passes her saving throw."
"Zac: Oh okay, yeah."
"Brennan: She bypasses Sanctuary, I don't know if you guys have any other piecey, creepy things you want to tell me about right now. But otherwise, I'm going to need a Constitution saving throw from again, Ricky, Misty, Sofia, Kingston and--"
"Ally: Wait, if she couldn't pass, if she couldn't cast it on Misty, would the whole thing be… Canceled?"
Brennan: Potentially yes.
"Ally: Okay, then I'll do a Bend Luck and spend two sorcery points. Or is it, yeah."
"Brennan: As your reaction? Cool, go for it."
Ally: So 1d4 to subtract from hers. 1.
"Siobhan: Okay, and then I will do my Cutting Words on—"
"Brennan: You've already used your reaction this turn, you haven't gone yet."
"Siobhan: I did? God, these turns are so long!"
"Emily: Doesn't 18 pass, 'cause I also have Bardic Inspiration I can add to it."
"Brennan: Well, tell me whether you want to use it or not."
Lou: 18.
Siobhan: I got 25.
Zac: Is it Constitution?
Brennan: Constitution saving throw.
Siobhan: We get 3 from—
"Emily: Oh wait, no, it's more than--"
Zac: You get 3 from me.
"Emily: Yeah, I get 3 from you, so actually it's 21, I'm gonna sit pretty, I think 21's gonna pass."
"Siobhan: Yeah, 25."
"Brennan: 21, 18."
Zac: A saving throw from enchantment or possession?
"Brennan: No, Constitution."
Zac: Do I add plus 3 to myself?
Brennan: Yes you do.
"Zac: Okay, so then I got a 27."
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: All right. Fuck it. 19, okay."
"Brennan: 19, okay."
"Siobhan: More than that, 'cause it's—"
"Murph: 22, plus your, was it Con?"
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: 24.
"Brennan: And actually Kug? I'm going to include you in that, I need a Constitution throw from you as well."
Murph: Fuck!
"Lou: What are you even doing, dude? If Kug's involved."
"Murph: Yeah, I'm so far back!"
"Siobhan: What the fuck are you even doing, dude?"
"Murph: Get out of here, man."
Emily: I wonder if it's some kind of mind trickery.
"Murph: Fuckin' sick, dude."
Brennan: I'm not sick.
"Emily: No, it's Constitution."
"Murph: You're sick, I got a fuckin' 8\. You're sick!"
[Ally laugh]
"Lou: You're sick, dude."
"Brennan: Okay, your Constitution was 8?"
"Murph: 8, think about it! Think about how you're sick."
Siobhan: Think about it.
Murph: Come on!
Siobhan: Go to bed tonight and think about it.
Lou: Do you feel bad enough to take this back?
Siobhan: Stay up all night.
Ally: Do I have to Wild Magic?
"Murph: Why are you doing this, you gotta ask yourself right now!"
Siobhan: Jesus christ.
"Lou: Dude, he just needs the d4s. Don't even trip right now!"
"Emily: Yeah, he's looking for d4s!"
"Brennan, holding a good-sized handful of d6s, adds a few more to his hand, grinning smugly."
"Lou: Oh wow, he's holding up the d6s so we can see!"
Murph: He’s looking for coins.
"Ally: Yeah, he's not using-- You're sick!"
Lou: How many is that?
Siobhan: You’re a fucking maniac.
"Zac: You're fuckin' sick, man!"
"Siobhan: Honestly, see somebody dude."
Lou: Stop this guy!
"Siobhan: Get some help, get some help."
Murph: And not in the good way.
"Brennan picks up even more d6’s, very daintily. Looking directly into the camera, he wiggles his fingers and grins unrepentantly."
"Zac: Just listen to us, you sick fuck."
Lou: Somebody stop him! Where’s the director?
"Brennan looks down at his handful of dice and puts a finger on his lips, pretending to consider them."
Zac: Stop it! Stop it!
Murph: Edit it out.
Lou: Somebody call Wizards of the Coast! This is not—
"Emily: It's not tabletop, if he drops the dice, we won't take damage!"
"Lou: What weird homebrew bullshit is this, you fuck? Fuckin' Reddit's gonna eat your ass about this, you know that?"
"Ally: Yeah, you're gonna love it."
"Siobhan: Your whole ass, cheeks and all."
"Lou: Your whole fuckin' ass, you little bitch!"
"Murph: We're all gonna eat your ass, Brennan!"
"Siobhan: We’re gonna eat your ass, Brennan!"
"Lou: You're never gonna shit again, you fuck!"
"During these ass-related comments, Brennan has been counting damage, up to a value past 40."
Brennan: Okay!
[cast laughs]
Lou: You're never gonna fuckin' sit down again.
"Brennan: The Lady Titania goes,"
Titania: Enough! I have seen enough!
Brennan: Boom! [explosion] Everyone that made their save—
Emily: Which was who?
"Brennan: Which was one, two, three, four, five. [This is everyone except Murph.] Everyone who made their save takes 24 points of radiant damage."
"Emily: Hellish Rebuke, she did damage to me!"
Brennan: Give her the Hellish Rebuke.
Emily: Okay.
Zac: 24?
"Brennan: Kugrash, you take 48 points of damage."
Murph: Good! I'm so close to dead.
Lou: What the f— Can I make an Insight check as to what the hell happened?
"Emily: I literally just rolled two 10s, that's 20 fire damage to her."
Brennan: Jesus.
"Emily: Well, I think she also, she does get a Dexterity saving throw. But she'll take half that."
[Murph groans]
Brennan: Okay. [fire whooshing] She's looking fucked up.
[Emily laughs smugly]
"Zac: What kind of saves, do we have to do our concentration saves?"
"Brennan: Also Kugrash, you take the damage and you are blinded. She's,"
Titania: [arms wide] I am Queen of the Seelie Fae! All of this must stop at once!
Ally: Fuck.
[explosion]
"Emily: She doesn't even have line of sight on you, right? Does it matter?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, she's—"
"Brennan: She's, it doesn't need line of sight. She's, this is a 60 foot radius. She's putting the center point of this in the wall, basically."
Siobhan: Cool.
"Brennan: She actually obliterates her own soldier, he's dead."
Lou: What's the DC for succeeding for holding on to your concentration spell?
"Brennan: Yeah, I'm gonna need some DCs."
"Murph: I'm done, yeah, my fire's, I mean—"
"Brennan: Your fire's toast? Go see, yeah."
"Murph: Half of 50, yeah, it's gone."
"Lou: So half of 24, so 12?"
"Brennan: So half of 24 is 12, yeah."
Lou: 12 plus what? What am I adding to the roll?
Brennan: Constitution.
Zac: Plus 3 if you're—
"Lou: I'm not close, but I'm good."
[whooshing]
"Zac: Okay, 7, yeah, I passed."
Brennan: You passed? Cool. How's that Erupting Earth doing?
"Ally: Oh, I haven't, I didn't roll for that, sorry."
Brennan: That's not gonna—
"Ally: Not good, yeah."
Brennan: Bum-bum-bum.
Siobhan: Let me get this--
Brennan: And then Hypnotic Pattern's gone as well?
"Siobhan: Oh no, Hypnotic Pattern is still there."
Brennan: Oh cool!
"Siobhan: Yeah, I got an, I rolled, I have like a 26."
Brennan: Dope.
Siobhan: A 27.
"[somber, discordant ambience]"
"Brennan: Incredible. You guys see, however, that Em is down."
Siobhan: Oh no! Oh my God.
Brennan: Wally is down.
Siobhan: [gasps] Wally!
Murph: Oh my God.
Emily: Oh my God.
"Murph is rubbing his brow again, concerned."
"Brennan: Alissa's down. And Esther actually was out of the blast radius. But, huge spell goes off. Pete, that's gonna be you."
"Ally: Great. I am going to step forward and say, with the power of the Dream World,"
Pete: Fuck off!
Ally: And I am going to cast a higher level Fireball spell on Titania.
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: On which you have advantage.
Ally: Yeah. And now I have advantage. So I do roll—
"Brennan: Well, Fireball isn't an attack roll. Fireball is a reflex saving throw."
"Murph: It took range, yeah."
"Brennan: But she's going to attempt to, it's after her turn, she's going to attempt to Counterspell that again. And I think, let me just double check Counterspell real quick."
"Zac: Dude, have we hurt Titania at all?"
Siobhan: She would have to do it a fourth level to cancel it immediately.
"Emily: Yeah we, I just Hellish Rebuked her."
"Brennan: So she's gonna, she's—"
"Emily: Yeah, you got her."
"Murph: Fireball higher level, right?"
"Ally: Yeah, I'm doing it as a four."
Brennan: She's gonna roll to see if she can Counterspell it. She does not Counterspell it.
Siobhan: Ohh!
"Ally: [victoriously] Everyone give me your d6s, please."
Zac: How many do you need?
Ally: I need nine.
Murph: Nice.
[claps]
"Ally: Hey, Brennan. Hey, Brennan. [briefly mocks Brennan’s dice collecting from earlier]"
"Siobhan: Yummy yummy, tastes like ass!"
"Ally: [pointedly] Oh, I still need one more. Huh. Thank you."
Murph: Ass dice. Sure.
Brennan: Oh yeah!
[suspenseful music]
"Ally: Okay! I got a lot of ones, honey!"
Lou: Honey!
Ally: Honey! That's...20...30.
Brennan: 30.
Ally: 30 points of damage.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Lou: The exact same amount I rolled yesterday.
Ally: Really?
"Lou: With 9d6s, I also rolled--"
[explosion]
"Brennan: A fucking colossal, so the people have seen this sun born into space, and now a roiling ball of fire, everyone's like, ooh, ahh! Titania looks hurt. She looks hurt."
"Ally: I wish I'd critted. Oh, you can't on that."
Brennan: That's going to be—
Siobhan: Just all sixes is a crit.
"Ally: Yeah, aw, that would have felt so—"
Emily: You got all sixes on that?
Brennan: I'm gonna need Wild Magic from Pete.
"Ally: Oh yeah, right. 8."
Siobhan: What are you up to on Wild Magic?
"Brennan: Now it's gonna be on a four. Four or lower. These mobsters are going to go, these pixie mobsters. They're gonna make some attacks with disadvantage on Misty, that's a miss. That actually is a hit, I'm gonna need a Constitution saving throw."
Zac: Plus 3. Oh wait. Are they shooting a gun at her?
Brennan: Yeah.
Lou: Plus Bless.
"Siobhan: Right. Plus 3 points Bless. 12, 15, 17."
Brennan: That's gonna pass. You do however take 7 points of damage.
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: What are you at?
Siobhan: I'm at 19.
Emily: How much damage did you take this round?
Siobhan: Quite a lot.
"Brennan: This guy's gonna take a shot at Kugrash. And he actually gets advantage, 'cause you're blind. And he misses both times anyway. [bullets pinging] You can hear him firing. That's going to be, that's the mobsters. Misty, that's your turn."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: You took 57 damage in the last turn.
Siobhan: Is it statistically possible for me at all?
"Brennan: You need, you luckily don't roll with disadvantage, but you need to roll a nat 20 to succeed."
Siobhan: Great.
"Lou: She's done it before, she'll do it again!"
Ally: Box of Doom!
Emily: I feel it! I feel it!
Brennan: Box of Doom coming out.
Emily: I feel a success in the air.
"Brennan: So you actually, you don't need your Blessed dice, 'cause you can only auto-succeed."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: You need a nat 20.
[suspenseful music]
"Siobhan: Gods of the theater, be with me this day."
"Ally: Ooh, a 13 and a 14."
Brennan: 13 and 14. That is a failure.
Siobhan: Well!
Emily: Okay.
Siobhan: Okay
"Brennan: By the way, I should say. Just like with normal death saves, a nat one is two failures, and a nat 20 is two successes."
Siobhan: Yes.
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: Misty has two failures and one success. Misty, you may take your turn."
Siobhan: I would like to...
Zac: Can you Mage Hand?
"Siobhan: I would like to cast Vicious Mockery on Titania, as a bonus action cantrip?"
"Brennan: Yes, go for it."
"Siobhan: Which is a Wisdom saving throw, or take 2d4 psychic damage and then she has disadvantage, oh wait. She already has disadvantage on the next attack."
"Lou: No, she, we only have advantage on attacking her."
"Siobhan: Okay, so she does not have a disadvantage, yeah. Okay, great. So I would like to do that."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: As my bonus action.
"Brennan: She has to make what kind of, she makes a Wisdom saving throw?"
Siobhan: It's a Wisdom saving throw.
Brennan: She fails.
Siobhan: Great!
Ally: Great.
Siobhan: So she takes 4 damage. But then has disadvantage on her next attack.
Brennan: Okay.
"Siobhan: And then I would like to try and cast Puppet on her again, which is again, a Constitution saving throw."
Brennan: To drop the crown?
Siobhan: To drop the crown and then fly as far as her movement can take her.
"Emily: No, no, no, keep her here, keep her here."
Brennan: She succeeds against Puppet.
Siobhan: Fuck!
[explosion]
"Titania: You wicked little child! You will return home and I will get my shoes back, you bitch! I want those shoes back!"
"Brennan: Cool, that's your action, bonus action."
"Siobhan: Hey, yeah, I mean, there's nothing much else I can do except move and that doesn't seem like there's any point in me doing that. So fuck me, I'm done."
"Brennan: Plant your feet. The Seelie do not exist anymore, they're all fuckin' dead. Sofia, that's you."
"Emily: Okay. Since I am currently.... have Otherworldly Leap, I'm going to jump up here."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: And then I'm gonna use a ki point, Step of the Wind, so then jump and attack her."
Brennan: Hold on one second!
"Siobhan: Oh my God, some Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon shit."
Emily: I jump as far as I can. And then [pops].
"Brennan: I just want to make, 'cause this is the dopest shit in the world. Oh! It lasts a minute, and it's not concentration!"
Emily: [very happy about it] Yeah.
"Brennan: Holy shit, let me just see what you can do. If you are using Step of the Wind and you have Jump active, your high jump is 24 feet off the ground."
Emily: So I was here.
"Brennan: Yep, yeah. You can reach up and grab it."
Murph: Jesus.
"Brennan: That is fucking insane. So Step of the Wind also gives you a dash, you're taking a dash action, right?"
"Emily: Yeah, so just basically, so I can jump up here and then jump and basically grapple with—"
"Brennan: It is, you can actually make it all the—"
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: That is the craziest shit in the world.
Ally points to different spots on the stage as if Sofia is jumping and makes a “zoom” sound.
"Emily: I'm gonna grapple her and actually, since I used Step of the Wind, I could still attack."
Brennan: You have your full action.
[Emily laughs]
Siobhan: Oh my god. Fuck her up!
Zac: Can you grapple her wings?
"Brennan: Hold on, I'm sorry, one sec. Yeah, you, yes, you can choose to grapple with an attack if you want, or you can just make your attacks."
"Emily: I'll use one, maybe I'll use one attack. I just want to fuck her up. How fucked up does she look?"
"Brennan: She looks way worse than she was when she came in. She doesn't look like she's on her last legs, but she looks hurt."
Siobhan: Oh my God—
Zac: Can you grapple her wings? Is she flying?
"Emily: Can I use one attack to try to grapple her wings, and then the next attack to just attack her?"
"Brennan: Yeah, give me a grapple check, so this is gonna be an oppo—"
"Emily: Will I get an advantage on this, or I wait 'til the attack 'cause of Kingston's thing?"
"Brennan: Oh yeah, you want to use advantage on your first attack, so do a damage attack, and then we'll do a grapple, right?"
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: Cool.
Brennan: So this one gets advantage.
"Emily: Okay, does a 17 hit?"
Brennan: 17 exactly hits.
"Emily: Yeah! I'm not even using my Bardic yet. Okay, so then I go for, hit her for 11."
"Brennan: 11 points of damage, Jesus, okay."
Emily: And then I am gonna grapple her. Try and grapple her so that she can't be flying anymore.
Brennan: You're gonna make opposed Athletics?
"Emily: Would that even work, or is her magic just levitating her?"
"Brennan: No, no, she's flying under the power of her wings. Your extra weight, if you like, you're basically wrestling to take her to the ground."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: So I'm gonna say that you can effectively grapple her if you beat her score, I'll say that if you beat, let's actually do this. Let's do a Box of Doom roll, 'cause we got the Box of Doom going."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: If you beat her roll, you grapple her. If you beat her by five or more, you begin to take her down to the ground."
Emily: Okay.
Ally: Yeah!
Emily: I'm still gonna have another attack on her.
Brennan: This is Athletics.
Emily: Can I also use a ki point for a Stunning Strike for that hit that I did to her?
Brennan: To do Stunning Strike?
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, you can do that."
Emily: So she would get to do a Constitution save.
Brennan: So she does a Constitution save.
Emily: Does she save?
Brennan: She fails.
Emily: So she's stunned!
Brennan: She's stunned.
Emily: So how does that affect this shit?
Zac: So she would just fall.
Emily: So does she just fall?
Brennan: Let's put the Box of Doom away.
[Emily laughs]
Siobhan: We made him put the Box of Doom away!
Emily: 'Cause then maybe I could just pound on her!
"Brennan: We see, you guys see here, first of all, give me an Acrobatics check with an advantage if you'd be so kind, just for your performance."
Emily: Okay. [clears throat]
Murph: A Staten Island woman just beating the shit out of this—
Emily: That's gonna be a 27!
Murph: Faerie queen.
"Brennan: You guys see, Titania goes and looks at the audience and says,"
"Titania: Fools! Fools, all of you! I, Titania, Queen of the Seelie Fae, command that you kneel!"
"Brennan: You guys see Sofia, [aggressive cat meows] Leaps! [purrs] Fuckin' like, [heavy footsteps]. Runs right off the catwalk, you see that Esther goes,"
"Esther: You fuckin' rule, Sofie! You got this!"
Sofia: [yelling to Esther] We gotta get coffee sometime!
Esther: I would honestly love that.
"Pete: [raising his hand] Hey, me too!"
"Sofia: Yeah, let's have a big ol' coffee day!"
"Esther: Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, for sure."
"Brennan: You see that you sprint right off the catwalk, Titania goes, [imitates whoosh] you Dragon Ball Z jump into the air, and up at the top, just become like, buh-buh-buh-bum! [impacts] Where you're hitting her in the middle of a jump. Whoop! [impact] A bunch of her teeth fly out of her fuckin' head, her crown skews on her head."
"Emily: Could we say for flavor that, instead of Stunning Strike, I take off my weight loss corset trainer and just put it around her so that she, like around her wings—"
"Brennan: She's bound up, Titania crashes out of the sky with you on top of her, to the ground. You’re each gonna take falling damage. Although you could, you have Slow Fall."
"Emily: I got Slow Fall, so it'll be reduced by five times six. So 30."
Brennan: Cool. You take 4 falling damage.
Emily: Okay.
Siobhan: She takes 34 falling damage?
"Brennan: No, she doesn't take 34 falling damage. But she is looking fucked up, gang."
Emily: And then I still have an attack and my bonus attack.
Brennan: So you used bonus as Step of the Wind.
"Emily: Oh, okay! But I still have my second attack."
"Brennan: No, that was your, oh no, stun! Yeah, you stunned for second attack! It's with advantage so she's stunned."
"Murph: Yah, you never grappeled."
Emily: Yah bitch.
Zac: Grab that crown!
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Emily: Okay, it's with advantage. And then 12 plus 8, 20's gonna hit. And I'mma fuck her up for [laughs smugly] 13!"
Ally: Nice.
[impact noises as Emily pretends to punch Titania]
Brennan: Incredible.
Emily: Can we say I'm straddled over her?
Brennan: Amazing.
"Ally: That guy in the back row's like, “What the fuck!”"
"Brennan: Yeah, you see that guy in the back row is like,"
Audience: Woo! Kung fu Shakespeare! This rules!
"Brennan: Perry LaFev is like,"
Perry: I'm going to strangle somebody!
"Emily: And then I think I'm high on the performance, so I turn to the audience again and I say,"
"Sofia: I may be little, but I am fierce!"
"Brennan: Standing ovation, Woo! [applause] Everyone's clapping,"
Audience: Yeah! It's a different actress!
"Brennan: You see incredible martial arts, brings her to the ground. That's going to be, you see that Confetti wheels over—"
Siobhan: Does she—
Zac: Is her spell broken if they're—
Brennan: She's gonna roll concentration.
"Emily: Oh yah, if she’s stunned."
"Murph: Yeah, I'm blinded by her right now, I don't know if that was a concentration spell."
"Brennan: No, she holds onto the spell. So you're still blinded, she holds onto the spell on them. And Confetti moves down, he's gonna make an attack on Sofia. Hits. Sofia—"
"Emily: I'm gonna Hellish Rebuke him again, 'cause I have [wiggling her shoulders] two spell slots now."
Brennan: Go for it.
[suspenseful music]
"Emily: He'll take 10 damage unless he does a Dexterity saving throw, in which case he'll take 5."
"Brennan: He does take 10 damage. I'm gonna need you to make a Constitution saving throw, though."
Emily: Okay.
[suspenseful music]
Emily: It's good. Do you want me to do the math? It’s really good.
"Brennan: No, I don't want you to do the math. You see Confetti drops down to you and says,"
"Don Confetti: Bicicleta, you have acted outside of the interests of the family. This curtain's for you."
"Brennan: Takes a silvery strand of garrote wire, loops it over your neck, hoists you up, you get your thumbs in just in time, but he does hoist you about 15 feet into the air."
"Emily: I say,"
"Sofia: [strained] It's actually still Lee, I went back to Lee!"
"Don Confetti: My apologies. Your marriage is a beautiful sacrament, and you will die a married woman."
"Brennan: Cool, you are up in the air with Don Confetti now."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: That's going to be… Buh-buh-buh, that's gonna be—"
"Emily: Just so everyone knows, she's stunned right now, so I think you'll all get advantages on attacks against her."
Brennan: Stephen Sondheim leaps up and makes an unarmed attack on the pixie and punches him in the back of the head. [impact] He's not down.
Lou: What a wild—
"Brennan: He's just,"
"Sondheim: The theater is my home, and I won't be fucked with here."
Emily: I hope Bernadette Peters comes in and saves us.
"Ally: Oh my God, I would die!"
"Brennan: Ricky, that's you, baby."
Zac: Ricky's gonna run for Titania.
"Brennan: Okay. Yeah, you close distance."
Zac: And...
Siobhan: Where is her head in relationship to his dick?
"Brennan: I mean, she's got a clear taint shot, for sure."
Zac: I'm trying to decide if I want to rip the crown off and throw it to Misty. Yeah. I think I'm gonna do that.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, she's stunned, so if that's your action, yeah, I don't think Ricky would chop someone's head off as they're stunned on the ground."
"Zac: Yeah, it feels wrong."
"Brennan: But yeah, you rip the crown off, and throw it—"
"Ricky: To the true queen, Titania!"
"Brennan: And you see the whole line, go ahead and make me a Performance with advantage there, or yeah, an Athletics, no you are speaking, so this is gonna be Performance, but you do have advantage."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: And you can add Bless to this.
"Zac: Okay, great."
Murph: Do good! Do good!
Lou: Do good.
"Zac: Okay, a 19 plus 4, plus whatever my—"
Brennan: Charisma.
Zac: 3\. So that's a 26.
"Brennan: [laughs] You turn completely naked, your dick out in front of everybody, you're holding this ax, you hurl the crown. And as you say, [whooshing] you know, This is the true Queen of the Fae, the whole audience goes,"
"Audience: Oh, that's what's going on!"
"Brennan: And you see the critic goes,"
"Dupree St. Croix: Extremely risky, and I applaud it. [pen clicks]"
"Brennan: Takes a note. Incredible. That's going, so that's Ricky, So, yeah, Sofia, Ricky, what a turn. There's gonna be some death saving throws from our allies."
Murph: Oh my God!
[suspenseful music]
Zac: Has Kingston gone again?
"Lou: No, I'm first up."
Emily: You're next.
Lou: Yep.
"Brennan: And then other allies, other allies. I'm trying to think if there's anybody, Wally's down. They're all down. Okay."
Emily: She stays stunned. Then she won't be able to hurt Misty.
"Brennan: That's going to then be, yeah, those are the allies. No, Esther's still up. Esther is going to cast… Whoa! See, Esther yells at you, Sofie, and says,"
Esther: Got your back!
Brennan: [explosion] And you see that Confetti freezes in midair and falls to the ground again.
"Sofia: Oh my God, yeah girl!"
Brennan: He's under the effect of a Hold Person spell.
Zac: Nice.
"Sofia: We are gonna have to do more than coffee, let's get drinks."
Brennan: That's Esther's turn. Then it's gonna be Kingston.
Lou: Fourth level Mass Healing word.
Emily: Ooh.
Lou: So we'll do 2d4. 5 plus what? What do I add to it?
"Brennan: Plus your Wisdom, so 10."
"Lou: Yeah, so 10. So 10 will go. My girl, we'll go Em, we'll go Wally."
Emily: Oh?
Lou: We'll go this man. We'll go this woman.
Ally: Kugrash really needs it
"Murph: Yeah, I’m at..."
Brennan: That's five. So you're using five?
Lou: That's five.
Murph: I'm at five.
Lou: And then one for Kug.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Thank you.
Brennan: Incredible. Whoom!
"Lou: And then I'll hit, can I, how far is, what is—"
Brennan: Cantrip?
"Lou: 60 feet, how far is 60 feet?"
Brennan: 60 feet is here. That's 60.
Lou: That's 60? Can I hit Titania?
Brennan: You can absolutely hit Titania.
"Lou: Yeah, I'll hit Titania."
"Brennan: She's stunned, you get advantage."
Lou: She makes Dex saving throws.
"Brennan: She needs a Dex saving throw? Cool. She gets disadvantage, or no, she has advantage normally, so she just rolls one die. She succeeds."
"Lou: Great. So no, sorry. Yeah, the target must succeed on a Dexterity, with, oh, she's good."
"Brennan: She's good, cool."
Lou: I just shoot her.
[magical shot]
"Brennan: Okay, right across the stage."
"Emily: Good for the show, though."
Lou: Yeah.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Kugrash, that's you, baby."
Lou: She's been finding a lot of weird pyrotechnics that just shoot across the stage.
"Murph: If I Wild Shape, do I lose my blindness?"
Brennan: I don't think so.
Murph: Okay.
Siobhan: What if you Wild Shape into something...
Zac: You'll gain other senses.
"Siobhan: Yeah, that's really good."
"Brennan: Yeah, actually, if you change into something with scent, then you don't need sight to attack. So you wouldn't have disadvantage on an attack roll."
Ally: Dogs.
Murph: Interesting. I do have a bear that has—
Ally: Oh yeah!
"Murph: Cool, I'll become a brown bear. Keen smell, bear has advantage on checks that rely on smell."
Lou: That bear's gotta get on stage.
"Emily: Yeah, I was gonna say!"
"Siobhan: So Shakespearean, I mean, look. It's A Winter's Tale and not it's A Midsummer Night's Dream, but—"
"Brennan: Your turn into a bear, to bear exits. You are the Shakespearean bear. Cool, you're a bear."
"Murph: Sweet. I can't, so that was an action. So you know what? Can I, I'll use a bonus action, Healing Word on myself."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Before I, how's Wally looking?"
"Brennan: Wally's looking okay, he's badly hurt. But Kingston has healed him."
"Murph: Ah, I gotta heal my boy Wally. I'll heal my boy Wally."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Before I do it. That's 8 to Wally.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: And then I'll turn into a Bear.
"Brennan: Cool, you turn into a bear."
"Murph: Hell yeah, I get bear hit points. So I'm fine."
Brennan: Do you take movement?
Murph: I'll run up to that pixie.
[Brennan makes a bear roaring noise]
Murph: Just so he doesn't shoot anybody else.
"Brennan: Rad, you charge him. That's Kugrash. Titania finishes being stunned."
"Emily: No, on my turn."
"Brennan: Oh, she finishes it on your turn."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Gotcha. So she's just still there.
"Emily: Do I see in her eyes that she wants to move, but she can't move?"
"Brennan: Yes, you do see that."
Emily: I fucking smile and I love it.
[Brennan laughs]
Emily: I slurp some of her blood off my chin.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, Pete, that's you."
"Ally: Great. Okay. I am going to just keep Fireballing, man."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: This time just at a third level.
Zac: Just a third.
Lou: I'm out here Fireballing.
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: Fireball Titania.
Brennan: There's probably no way for you to do that without setting the theater on fire or hitting Ricky.
"Ally: Oh, I'm, uh, Careful Spell."
"Brennan: Oh hell yeah! Great, you can hit, so you spend a point. Dope. You're gonna hit Titania."
"Ally: Yeah, just Titania."
Brennan: You could probably hit Titania and these two pixies if you want.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, great. Yeah, 'cause it's a 20 foot radius."
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure you can hit them."
"Ally: Great, so they make Dex saving throws and this time, I just roll 8d6s."
"Brennan: Dope, go for it."
Ally: I need some d6s please. Thank you.
Lou: My man.
"Ally: Two more, one, two, thank you."
Murph: That’s a d8.
Emily: Do you need mine?
Murph: Is this mine?
"Lou: Oh, are they d6s?"
Murph: Where did your d6 go?
"Ally: That's great, I got it."
Murph: Did you give me a green one or is this—
"Ally: Wait, I'll take this red one."
Lou: I threw a d6.
"Ally: And then I need, yeah, here's one d6."
Emily: Are you just compiling the perfect color palette? [laughs]
Brennan: Go for it.
"Ally: Come on, give me some sixes!"
Murph: Pretty good.
"Ally: Yeah, all right, two sixes."
"Lou: My boy did well, my boy gave her six, there you go. That's my boy right there. That's my proud son. Oh yeah."
"Emily: Are you, whenever I give someone one of my dice I am like, “What did the purple one do?”"
Ally: 26!
Lou: [claps] That's my boy!
"Brennan: 26? These pixies only have 13 hit points, so they're toast even if they make their save."
[fire whooshing]
Ally: Thank you. These are yours.
Ally distributes all their borrowed d6s back out to the cast.
Brennan: Pixies are toast.
Ally: One of these is yours and one is Kingston's.
Lou: Mine.
Murph: Yellow is yours?
Lou: Cool.
Siobhan: Sorry. You’re welcome.
"Ally: Great, and then Wild Magic."
"Brennan: Yeah, give me that Wild Magic roll."
Ally: 16.
Brennan: And how much did you say you did? You did 26?
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Okay, Titania is looking hurt. And you didn't do Wild Magic. Mobsters are gonna go. You see this dude flies away, you do get an attack of opportunity on him as he flies."
Murph: Good. Fuck him up! 24.
"Brennan: Yeah, roll bear damage."
Murph: Do I do bite or claws?
Brennan: Claws has opportunity.
Murph: Hell yeah. 8 damage.
"Lou: That bear, Kugrash."
"Brennan: Wah, just like, badly injured pixie flies away from you."
Emily: I picture him wearing sunglasses.
"Brennan: But he does fly up there, all of her little pixies have hit the deck."
Siobhan: There's still this guy up here.
"Brennan: That guy up here, yeah. He just flew up, he's gonna take a shot at you, Misty."
[Emily gasps]
"Zac: But he gets disadvantage, right?"
"Brennan: Oh, he does get disadvantage."
Emily: Disadvantage!
Siobhan: He gets disadvantage and I get advantage.
Lou: Did he have to make a Wisdom saving throw?
"Brennan: And he has to make a Wisdom saving throw. Okay, he succeeds the Wisdom saving throw. Misty, your AC is 14, he does still hit."
Siobhan: What about if I—
"Brennan: You can, oh, if you want to use your reaction, do Cutting Words, you can—"
Siobhan: Cutting Words.
Zac: Hit 'em with the razzle dazzle.
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: I'm gonna let you know right now, you're gonna need to roll a five or higher."
Siobhan: That is an 8.
Brennan: Hell yeah!
[cheers]
"Brennan: You, dah! [explosion] Hit the note, ting! [bullet pinging] The bullet flies off in another direction. That's going to be, Misty, that is your turn. I believe you took no damage this round."
Emily: She took no damage.
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Took no damage this last round. Let's get this Box of Doom out.
Emily: She's also Blessed.
Siobhan: And I'm Blessed.
"Brennan: So all we are looking at, and did anyone fail their Performance checks?"
Siobhan: No.
Ally: I didn't have one.
"Brennan: No, and no one else is on stage, right?"
Emily: I honestly succeeded wildly.
Brennan: You do have to roll a performance check for your cockroach though.
"Murph: Oh, I'll dismiss the cockroach if he's not—"
"Brennan: We'll get rid of him, he's good. Get that cockroach off here, let me get that. Cool. It's just a DC10. The only thing that could happen is you could roll two ones."
[suspenseful music]
Siobhan: That is a nat 20.
[everyone cheers]
Brennan: Oh my God!
Emily: That means you saved!
Siobhan: That is the most important nat 20 of my goddamn life!
Brennan: Oh my fuckin' God!
Ally: That means you fully won!
Siobhan: [shouts] I'm gonna live forever!
"Brennan: Yeah! [laughs] Yeah. You see the band kicks up, you had one success and two failures, with life or death, you hit a nat 20, that's two successes."
Siobhan: I'm fully squelching a high C.
"Brennan: Yeah, just, [sings] Give me your hand, if we be friends, and Titania shall, [normal] the crown gleams on your head, [singing] shall restore amends! [explosion] Everyone weeps, everyone screams, they rend their hair, a few people cum, it's incredible."
Emily: [waving her hand] I’m one of them.
Misty: The power of live theater! This is why we need to keep this here!
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: My God, the spell is successful!"
Emily: Woo!
"Siobhan: Can I have my dice back, please?"
"Brennan: Yes you may, I'll get you your dice back. Wow, a nat fuckin' 20."
Ally: That's crazy.
Brennan: Cool!
Lou: I don't even know what is happening.
"Ally: I know, I'm in a fugue state."
Lou: It's crazy.
"Siobhan: Oh, there's another one in there, sorry."
Brennan: Is there another one in there?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Ooh.
"Lou: Brennan lost, and he knows that Reddit's gonna eat his ass, so now he's trying to steal our dice."
[Emily laughs]
Siobhan: Yummy yummy.
Zac: You lost.
Siobhan: In my tummy.
"Zac: You lost, sir."
"Lou: You lost, you stupid--"
"Brennan: Misty, you still have your full turn."
Siobhan: Great!
Emily: Just use it to dance.
Siobhan: What does the crown do? I'm wearing this crown now.
"Brennan: It's just a beautiful, gorgeous crown. You feel that Titania is on, truly at the edge, the brink of death over there. And this is the crown of the Seelies. So... you know."
[stately orchestral dancing music]
"Siobhan: Great. I would like to… Just because it feels right, cast Irresistible Dance on her."
[Brennan laughs]
"Siobhan: And so she has to, oh, so it's my Performance check, my Dexterity Performance check versus hers."
Murph: Whoa.
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: And she doesn't—
Siobhan: So that's really high.
Murph: Holy shit.
Siobhan: That is 20 plus Dex.
Brennan: The—
Siobhan: 26.
"Brennan: The Queen of the Fae, still stunned, as you dance, cartoonishly wobbles up, her head on a swivel, ta-tap-tap, ta-tap-tap-tap, ta-tap. And begins to buffoonishly dance around the stage."
"Siobhan: And then as my bonus action, I'll cast Vicious Mockery again."
Brennan: Go ahead and she rolls. Fails her save.
Siobhan: Great. That's 6 damage.
Brennan: She had 4 hit points left.
Emily: Woo!
Ally: She's down.
"Misty: I killed my queen! This is America, we don't have royalty here!"
Brennan: In-fucking-credible. Titania is no more.
Ally: Stephen Sondheim thinks he's next to a bear.
Siobhan: Honestly a normal day for Stephen Sondheim.
Zac: Run on stage with Stephen Sondheim.
[Ally groans]
"Brennan: Sofia, that's gonna be your turn."
"Emily: Is there anyone here who needs to, oh Don!"
Brennan: Don Confetti.
Emily: I'm gonna fuckin' just attack Don Confetti.
"Siobhan: Is Don Confetti now no longer under Titania's spell, right?"
Brennan: He is no longer under the spell.
Emily: I'm going to attack him to a point where I can intimidate him.
Brennan: You can beat him unconscious if you want.
"Emily: Yeah, I'm gonna beat him unconscious."
Sofia: You guys cool if we take him back to a warehouse and question him?
Misty: Absolutely.
"Kingston: I don't love it, but okay."
"Misty: That sounds good, to do that."
"Brennan: Go ahead and roll your attacks, and then, he's held, so they're all with advantage."
"Emily: Oh, he's oh, good, because. Okay, so."
Brennan: That's a hit.
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: Roll again.
"Emily: I'll, okay."
Brennan: That's a hit.
Emily: That's a hit.
Brennan: That's a hit.
"Emily: I'll Flurry of Blows too. Okay, they're all hits."
Brennan: They’re all hits.
"Emily: Okay, so I hit him for..."
Brennan: 6.
"Emily: Okay, so 6 plus 10, 16."
"Zac: He's done, right?"
"Brennan: 16 and 17, so that's 33."
Murph: Jesus.
Emily: And that's all I think. 33.
Ally: Whoa.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: That's all.
"Brennan: He is messed the fuck up. You are just pounding him [impacts] with some brutal damage into submission. [imitates impacts] Buh-buh-buh. And you see that some people are like, you see pounding, don't quite get it, but the ritual's over so the play doesn't have to make sense anymore. Confetti's turn. At the end of his turn, he breaks out of the, he, yeah, he breaks out, you jump over here. Sondheim looks over at you and says,"
"Sondheim: Bear, I don't know who you are, let me ride your back, take me to the stage."
"Kugrash: I mean, yeah!"
"Brennan: He jumps on your back, and rides you out, he gives you his movement, basically. And Stephen Sondheim riding a bear, busts through the curtain, and you see he goes,"
Sondheim: Magnificent! Magnificent. The greatest Broadway show of all time!
"Brennan: And you see that the, both of the glasses lenses of the New York Times critic burst in shock, he goes,"
"Dupree St. Croix: Aah, heavens! [imitates glass shattering]"
"Brennan: Ricky, that's you."
"Zac: [laughs] I'm just gonna step to the front and say,"
Ricky: The play's over!
"Brennan: The play's over, yeah! The house lights come up, there's a lot of bodies, the rest of the cast is looking out from backstage. Cool."
"Siobhan: I would like to cast Suggestion on the critic just to make sure that he writes us an extra favorable review, which is my, the trick that I always play at the end of every play."
Brennan: Incredible.
Siobhan: Just for safekeeping!
"Brennan: Kingston, that's gonna be you."
"Lou: Oh, really?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: Guys, let's fuck up, let's get Don Confetti unconscious, and then we can question him."
Lou: Oh okay.
Ally: Or do an Insight check to see if there's someone we're not even seeing.
Brennan: The only enemy left is Don Confetti right now.
"Ally: Oh, okay."
Lou: Got it.
"Brennan: Yeah, Em's gonna go heal you [Misty], by the way. So she rushes over to you."
Siobhan: Oh great.
"Lou: Great. I guess I'll, yeah, I mean, I guess I'll, I don't--"
Brennan: [whispers to Siobhan] 17.
"Lou: Yeah, if that's what it's gonna take to end this, I'll bring, I'll hit Don Confetti with a third level Guiding Bolt."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Lou: 7 plus 8, which is 13, does that hit?"
Emily: 15.
"Brennan: 15 does hit, yes, exactly hits."
"Lou: Great. Third level Guiding Bolt, that's three, so 6, 10, so 14."
"Brennan: Kingston, you raise your hand, see Don Confetti, who's been a thorn in this city’s side for so long. Raise your hand and pew! [magical shot] He drops to the stage. That is going to be Kugrash."
"Kugrash: All right, where is that, Sondheim, where's the pixie who attacked you?"
"Brennan: You see he looks up and says,"
Sondheim: The devil you're referring to is up there.
[Emily laughs]
Sondheim: The scoundrel in a robe.
Murph: I would like to throw Stephen Sondheim at the pixie. If he's cool with it. With your permission.
Brennan: I want you to do this. I want you to roll an Athletics check with advantage.
"Kugrash: [laughs] Okay. Sondheim, talk me through it, I'm blind!"
"Siobhan: Jesus Christ! You're also Blessed, don't forget you're Blessed."
Murph: [laughs a little hysterically] Okay! I'm so scared right now!
Lou: Don’t you dare kill Stephen Sondheim.
"Zac: You have to, you have to throw Stephen Sondheim as a blind bear."
Ally: You have to.
"Murph: I simply must. Okay, okay. Athletics as a bear would be strength. So wait, where's my bear, okay. So okay. We got 8, 20."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: You, whoom! [whooshing] You see he goes,"
Sondheim: The theater!
"Brennan: Grabs this catwalk, swings up here."
"Zac: He's been hurt for 8, right?"
"Murph: Yeah, I—"
Brennan: He has been hurt for 8.
Murph: The pixie I hit before.
Zac: Didn't he punch him in the back of the head?
Brennan: He did punch him in the back of the head.
Lou: Now he's gonna do it again.
"Emily: Come on, Sondheim! Finish him off!"
Brennan: Crit.
[cheers]
Emily: Sondheim crits!
Lou: Sondheim crit.
"Brennan: You see Stephen Sondheim goes up behind the pixie as he's got the gun down, he sees Titania and Don Confetti go down, and goes,"
"Sondheim: Crime never pays, friend. Whoa, snap! [impacts]"
Brennan: And Steven Seagal head snaps this pixie.
Emily: Oh wow.
"Brennan: And then gingerly cradles him in his arms, walks over here, grabs one of the ropes and just slides, like zoom, slides down. Walks on to the stage—"
Emily: He's just so at home in the theater.
"Brennan: He walks out in front of everybody here holding this dead pixie, and you see he goes,"
"Sondheim: To sleep, perchance to dream. Who knows what drove this creature to this life of crime, or what drove Titania to fight a clone of herself at the end of this play. We ask only this: Know that the answers do not lie here on the stage, but within all of you. Good night, and these gentle players have performed their act courageously, and from a place of truth, then you will bear this light out into the world."
"Brennan: Audience, [riotous applause]"
"Siobhan: Can I, as I'm taking a bow, do an Arcana check on Stephen Sondheim?"
Brennan: Yes you can.
Siobhan: Great. It's a 6.
Brennan: 6\. What a man.
Siobhan: What a man.
"Emily: Can I do one, what if I—"
Murph: Creativity's magic.
Emily: I got a 2.
Ally: 17.
"Brennan: 17, Stephen Sondheim is some kind of powerful entity at the heart of the city. The audience leaves, you guys turn to look at each other. You see that, yeah. Perry runs out on stage and goes,"
Perry: What the fuck was that! You've ruined—
"Brennan: And you see Stephen Sondheim caresses his cheek and goes,"
"Sondheim: No, no, Perry. Let's not question the process. Let's invest in the process. I want to talk to you about this play."
"Brennan: Puts his shoulder around, and walks Perry off the stage."
Siobhan: Isn't his name Pierre? Isn't Perry the—
Brennan: Perry LaFev is the—
Siobhan: They're both called Perry?
"Brennan: Yeah, both of—"
Siobhan: There's two Perrys in the story?
Brennan: There's two Perrys in this.
Emily: Oh my God.
Siobhan: What are the chances.
Ally: But it is Perry in disguise.
Siobhan: Aah.
Emily: That's what I'm saying.
"Brennan: That's going, you see Alissa runs out and says,"
"Alissa: Misty, you were amazing."
Misty: What are you doing on stage right now?
"Alissa: I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. It will never happen again."
Emily: Can I do an Insight check on Alissa?
"Misty: Jesus Christ, Alissa."
Emily: If she's full of shit?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Ally: Yeah, same."
Emily: I got a 1.
"Ally: I got an 18, is she single?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I’ll do that."
Brennan: She doesn't appear to be—
Siobhan: I got a 3.
Brennan: She doesn't appear to be full of shit. She appears to be—
"Emily: So she didn't knowingly orchestrate all this, although I got a 1."
"Brennan: Did not know, you guys are there on stage with Misty, Esther, Em, Wally, the rest of them jump down."
Murph: I'm a blind bear. Can anyone help me?
Lou: I'll walk over and cast—
"Kugrash: Can everything resolve itself, how did Stephen Sondheim do?"
"Sofia: As everybody's talking behind me, I go into the,"
"Misty: Thank you so much, twice a year, we here on Broadway collect for a great organization called Broadway Cares Equity Fights AIDS."
"Sofia: Oh my God. Kug, were you blind when I did my jumps, did you miss both my jumps?"
Kugrash: I was behind the stage I think when that happened.
Sofia: Oh my god.
Emily: I re-create it for him as much as I can.
"Brennan: You jump around, you re-create it. Some of the magic's gone, but you feel yourself, Misty, you feel vibrantly young. You need to find somewhere private to be soon, because you're about to, you're about to leave this body. You guys see that Misty starts glowing."
[ambient music]
"Misty: [quickly] So anyway, the members of the chorus will be out in the lobby, collecting, thank you so much for coming, have a wonderful evening."
Sofia: And I run back to my dressing room.
"Brennan: You run for your dressing room. You feel the paper husk of your skin start to, [imitates skin crackling], coughing. [imitates coughing] It's a little bit of an uncomfortable process. You rush back to your dressing room. Alissa stands in front of the door to make sure that you have privacy. The rest of you guys are out on stage with an unconscious Don Confetti."
"Emily: I turn to Esther and I say,"
"Sofia: Esther, Don Confetti's got, there's a lot of information inside of him, and I think we can get it out of him, can we bring him to the chantry?"
"Brennan: [snaps fingers] Whoom! [explosion] She wraps him in chains that are glowing with light, and she says,"
Esther: I can take him there right now if you need me to.
"Sofia: Yeah, once I wrap it up here, I'll meet you there."
"Esther: We'll keep him on ice, I'll see you later tonight."
"Sofia: Okay, thank you."
"Zac: I look around for some faun legs, costume faun legs to put on over my naked body."
"Brennan: You've put on some satyr pants. Incredible. The rest of you guys, you're injured, so you're taking care of yourselves. Misty. You feel holding this crown, you could make a place for yourself here in New York, if you wanted to. But you'd have to wear the crown to do it."
"Siobhan: What do you mean, a place for myself?"
"Brennan: Titania has been slain. You wear her shoes, you hold her crown, and your ritual was a success, even in the face of all this magic. The Seelie and Unseelie courts were founded a long time ago. But it's not impossible to found a court of your own. But that would mean that you'd have to wear the crown."
"Misty: I mean, who am I to refuse the crown when it's placed so deftly upon my head?"
"Brennan: Whoom, the light glows brighter and brighter and brighter."
"Alissa: Miss Moore, is everything okay in there?"
"Misty: Everything's fine, Alissa, just, [coughs] just keep standing out there, please."
"Brennan: You begin to change. And with that, we're going to end this session of The Unsleeping City. Tune in next time, guys!"
Ally: Aww.
Lou: What's going on!

"Brennan: You are, whoom! Sucked into the room in a swirl of light. Whum-whum- whum-whum-whum-whum-whum! You guys are zapped into Nod."
"Sofia: Wait, so is this like Misty Moore, my favorite Broadway singer and star just died?"
"Rowan: To the outside world, yeah."
Pete: What haven't you told us? It feels like it could fill a book.
Aquamarine: May I ask a favor of you in exchange for my service.
"Rowan: Oh, a faerie asking a favor."
"Kugrash: David's a fuckin' ball buster, I mean. He should be, I ruined his life."
Brennan: You hear a bang-bang-bang on the door as you say that.
Kugrash: Oh god.
"Kingston: The city is in danger, Lowell, and I believe you're one of the few people who can help us."
Lowell: I'm waiting for this moment my whole life.
Ally: What the fuck! That's insane!

[RECAP]
"Brennan: We find ourselves opening night. Misty Moore, Lady Titania and the Seelie Dance Fighters take the stage."
Misty: The show must go on!
Brennan: You will be making death saving throws (Siobhan rolls in box of doom) with your Performance checks.
Pete: What the fuck do we do?
Misty: Let's kill Titania!
Kugrash: I'll become a brown bear.
Murph: I would like to throw Stephen Sondheim at the pixie.
"Titania: I, Titania, command that you kneel."
"Brennan: You Dragonball Z, jump into the air. [imitating punching] Titania crashes out of the sky with you on top of her."
Siobhan: That is a nat 20.
[everyone shouting]
"Brennan: Titania has been slain. You wear her shoes, you hold her crown, and your ritual was a success."
"Misty: I mean, who am I to refuse the crown, when it's placed so deftly upon my head?"
[END RECAP]
[upbeat tempo]
"Zac, Emily, and Ally are holding d20s extremely tightly."
"Brennan: Welcome one and all back to The Unsleeping City. My name is Brennan Lee Mulligan. These are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Siobhan: You gotta make the impression of twenties on your thumbs, otherwise the luck doesn't happen."
Lou: That's the dream.
Zac: I do them on my pointer fingers.
"Siobhan: Ooh, mixing it up, 'cause you spicy."
"Ally: [at the same time] Ooh, ‘cause you roll like that. [makes twirling motion with their hands]"
"Brennan: Gang, last we left off—"
"Siobhan rolls dice, they fly off the table behind her. The music abruptly cuts out."
"Siobhan: [while laughing] Oh, fuck!"
All: [laughing]
Zac: Come on.
Brennan: Oh no!
Siobhan: Oh no!
Murph: Where'd it go?
Brennan: Ill omens.
"Brennan: Last we left off, our intrepid heroes had just slain Titania, the Queen of the Seelie Faeries, on stage at the premiere of Midsummer Nights, starring Misty Moore."
Siobhan: Who's she? I don't know who that is.
Brennan: Who the hell is Misty Moore?
"Brennan: Misty retreated to her dressing room, where she is enveloped in a cocoon of light, and the rest of our gang we left on stage, after their holidays and various adventures in Nod and beyond. You all are on stage. The audience is being led out. You see the critic from the New York Times going—"
"Dupree St. Croix: A smashing success! Perry, you were a vision!"
"Brennan: You see Perry LaFev going,"
"Perry: [through gritted teeth] Oh, I'm so glad you liked it!"
"Brennan: You see that Em, the Angel of Bethesda Fountain turns over to you and says,"
"Em: Wow, I can't believe it. Does this always happen at Broadway shows? I don't make it out a lot, 'cause I live on a fountain."
"Sofia: Yeah, I think so."
"Kugrash: I assume so, this is my first one too."
Sofia: I've only been to a couple.
"Pete: [while laughing] Absolutely not! No, this is, something else is going on."
"Kingston: I'll have to agree with Pete, no."
"Em: Alright, well I—"
"Sofia: Well, I agree with Kug, so you know."
Kugrash: Two and two and two so—
Em: Well listen—
Ricky: I will have to say that I think this happens a lot.
"Pete:  Alright, well."
Kugrash: It's three to two.
"Kingston: Ricky. put your pants back on, God damn."
Sofia: Or don't.
"Em: Well listen, I've got a lotta free time because the fountain's still broken so if anyone wants to come to Washington Square Park and get coffee, you know, talk to me."
"Sofia: Oh yeah, that sounds great."
"Em: Do you? Uh, I hate to do this—"
"Brennan: And you see that Esther's over in the corner cleaning some like blood off of her magical silver bat, she's like,"
"Em: I heard you saying that you were going to go out for coffee with Esther. I don't want to be like a third wheel but if I like, came by and got coffee..."
"Sofia: Oh my God, no you should totally come."
"Em: I would love that, that would be so fun."
Sofia: Yeah.
Brennan: You see that she—
"Sofia: Oh my God, we should start our own like first wives club."
"Em: I would love that because I don't ever get a chance to do that, and like its kinda been fun, a little fun little adventure around the city, I've been off the fountain for a while. When they fix the fountain I'm gonna hafta be like kind of stuck there again, so if we like do something there."
"Sofia: Oh yes, so just come out while you are out, yeah."
"Em: Yeah, I'm happy to host,when I'm back at the fountain. So just like—"
"Sofia: Awesome, I love that."
"Brennan: She does a little (mwah, mwah!) kiss and takes off flying. You see that Esther and Wally both walk over. You see that Steven Sondheim at the edge of the stage turns to you all and says,"
"Stephen Sondheim: Incredible work. You're all heroes, heroes of New York."
Brennan: [bells chiming] Vanishes.
Ally: What!
"Sofia: Oh my God, I didn't even get to do my Little Red Riding Hood for him!"
"Brennan: You see Esther gets Don Confetti. She looks at you guys and says,"
"Esther: I'm gonna head back to the Clinton Hill Chantry. I'll see you all there. I’m gonna make sure that he, I'm gonna put him in a magic circle basically."
Brennan: She vanishes.
"Ricky: Awesome, bye."
Ricky looks down and makes a sound of disappointment.
"Brennan: Wally goes,"
"Wally: Wow, Dad, this was the, this was the best show ever. I didn't know it's like a open mic where you could jump up and do stuff."
"Kugrash: Yeah. Wally you gotta be careful, we both got knocked out there for a second, huh."
Wally: What?
Kugrash: We almost died.
There’s a long pause.
Wally: When?
"Kugrash: [laughing] All right bud,"
Murph: I just pat him on the—
Kugrash: Good show man!
"Wally: It was great, where's Ricky's dog?"
Ricky: He'll be back. He's gone right now.
Pete: He died. Someone killed him immediately.
Kugrash: He didn’t. He didn’t— Pete.
Pete: What?
"Sofia: But it's okay when he dies,"
[overlapping]
Sofia: I learned that the hard way because I tried so hard to defend him and then he just disappeared and no one really cared.
Kugrash: He’s made of light.
Pete: [loudly above the others] He’s an adult!
Ricky: Yeah.
"Wally: Oh okay, he went to a farm upstate."
"Ricky: A farm made of light, yes. You'll see him soon."
Kugrash: This technically isn't a lie.
Pete: This is really sad.
"Wally: Okay, well I better go back to the apartment, I gotta—"
"Pete: How old are you, Wally?"
Wally: Huh?
Pete: How old are you?
Wally: I'm 38 years old.
Pete: Okay (laughs) great.
Ricky: 38?
"Pete: This is, I mean, okay, great."
"Wally: Yeah, I'm 38, I work for the MTA."
Pete: Cool. That's cool man.
"Kugrash: Pete, tell me how to deal with this. What is the right way to navigate this?"
"Pete: I'm thinking, just honesty, right guys?"
"Wally: I better go take care of Dad, bye guys."
Kugrash: It's his other dog. It's his dog. I gave him a dog. He named his dog Dad after me.
"Pete: All right, actually maybe you are handling this right, you're probably handling it right. All right, I'm sorry."
"Brennan: You guys are, so it's just, basically the five of you minus Misty that are left on stage right now. See Alissa, kind of concussed, wanders off to go to Misty's dressing room."
"Kugrash: What do you guys think’s going on with Misty here, because that was weird?"
Kingston: She's definitely got some explaining to do.
"Pete: Yeah, she was saying there's a lot that she hasn't told us, but that it was really important that the show went well. So I think everything was fine."
Sofia: Well I do think that we helped the show go well.
"Kingston: And everything is not fine, people got very hurt."
Kugrash: Should we go bang on her door?
Kingston: Yes we should.
Sofia: We could politely knock first.
[overlapping]
"Kingston: Nah, I'm with this, let’s have Kugrash approach."
Kugrash: I think we could bang. Let’s have a vote on politely knocking.
Sofia: Youse can bang. I'm going to politely knock while you all bang.
"Ricky: You can check the knob first and then you can bang on it, I think."
Sofia: I'm going to politely knock.
"Kingston: All right, so we're gonna have a three step process."
"Brennan: Gotcha. You guys walk up and see Alissa already politely knocking on the door. Alissa cannot see it, but you see that just light, pure golden light is like. [imitating engine pulsing]"
Zac: I rush up and get Alissa to stand back.
"Ricky: Sorry, clear the way, I'm a firefighter."
"Alissa: Oh, is there an emergency? Do you need water, coffee?"
"Ricky: We're good, just need you to stand clear,"
Zac: And I check the knob.
Brennan: The knob is a little bit warm but not dangerously so.
"Kingston: Great, so can we bang now? We've done the other first two steps."
Ricky: Feels like we can bang.
Sofia: Let's kick it down if we're going to do anything.
[overlapping]
Pete: What? That was a hard 180! What the fuck?
Kugrash: What? What is this? What is she?
Sofia: We kick it.
[everyone laughing]
"Brennan: Rad, you guys—"
Ally: So Jersey.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Athletics check.
Kingston: Yeah that feels right.
Kugrash: From politely knocking to kicking down.
Emily: I got a 12.
"Brennan: Bang! You kick the door open. Boom. As you turn around you see, Misty is hovering about three feet off the ground, light is oozing all around her. She has stripped herself of her skin and is just down to this like platonic primal form. What is Misty, all the glamor stripped away? As her like raw faerie form look like?"
"Siobhan: Just sort of an uncanny valley version of a human. Just everything is a little too big, a little too spiky."
"Brennan: Huge eyes, long spiky ears."
"Siobhan: Yeah, like places that should be thin are too thin, like everything's just a little off. Too much."
Zac: She's like an anime character?
"Siobhan: Yeah, or like a video game."
"Sofia: Oh my God, she's beautiful."
"Brennan: Misty, you're like deep in this extremely vulnerable process and your door to your dressing room is kicked open."
Misty: Excuse me?
"Kugrash: Let's close the door. Ricky, can you pick this back up? Put it back up?"
Zac: Pick the door up.
Sofia: Can I stay and watch? I know you like an audience.
"Brennan: As you guys kick the door open, you see that your magic. [imitating mysterious chiming] Hold on one second."
Brennan turns and rolls something behind the board.
Sofia: Oh no!
Brennan: And 100% of you are sucked into the room in a swirl of light.
Ricky: Aah!
Ally: What?
"Brennan: And you guys, you appear. Pete, you immediately are able to protect everyone because you guys are zapped into Nod."
[classical music]
"Brennan: As you appear in the Sixth Borough, you are very close to where Broadway is. You guys are near the old FAO Schwarz building that was shut down. But you see here in Dream, this giant toy store is there."
"Misty, you feel all of the joy and passion and love and adoration that you've harvested is now filling your body. You're in a volcanic state but you are somewhat settling. So you're kind of like making your new body but you're in Dream so it's a little bit chimeric still. And you appear with all of your friends, as you look around and see little sprites and nixies and griggs and pookas and brownies, and little fair folk all in the Dream realm, kind of rushing over to FAO Schwarz and doffing their caps and waving and bowing as they walk by you."
All of you are here in Nod together.
Pete: Do you want some privacy?
Kingston: What is happening?
Kugrash: What's going on here?
"Misty: I mean, look I didn't think that… [stammers] Hi guys. This was supposed to be a private little thing that was happening to me anyway and, I wasn’t really anything—"
"Sofia: In our defense, we helped save your life."
"Misty: Yeah, look."
Ricky: Is this like that movie Cocoon?
Sofia: Or The Fly?
"Misty: No, it's—"
Pete: Is this like that show Wife Swap? But you're both wives?
"Misty: That is like, no, I just. this is what I do, every seventy, eighty years I come back. Although this time like, I just have never had to deal with the DMV before. Like this has never been..."
Ricky: You sound younger.
"Misty: Yeah, I just, every seventy, eighty years, I just reincarnate my body into a younger form and then I start over."
"Ricky: But you sound younger, like a young p—"
Misty: Yes because I'm in a young person's body.
"Brennan: As you say that you see that your body does start to, it gets a little bit taller although you're still quite short. Your skin begins to coalesce, it's young and vibrant. all of your skin like begins to like move up into your body. Your cheek bones raise up. like your eyelids and lips and everything becomes a little bit plumper and more moist. and just natural vibrant color begins to flow into your skin in the Dream realm, but your hair and eyes like shifting colors here. And you begin to feel all that tiredness and liver spots and the shifting of the hips and everything like that. Your body feels, like, good again."
Misty: [wiggling] I'd forgotten what that felt like to not have that ache. This feels great!
"Pete: Sorry, you're still Misty?"
"Misty: Yeah, I've been Misty this whole time. But before I was Misty, I was other people, and then before that I was living in Faerie."
"Sofia: Wait, so is this like Misty Moore, my favorite Broadway singer and star just died?"
Misty: To the outside world yeah.
Sofia: [crying a little] Oh my God.
"Pete: [long, drawn out] Wow. You're gonna fake your own death."
Sofia: Oh my God.
"Misty: Well, I mean, the body that I was living in, I mean, it is kind of like a rebirth so it's not a faked death exactly."
"Brennan: You guys look back through this pulsing, this after pulse of the teleportation that brought you here. And you see, you guys are all gone, but you see that Alissa peeks her head around the partially open door and sees Misty's body on the floor and goes."
"[discordant, spooky chords]"
Alissa: Miss Moore! [screams].
"Brennan: And like screams and goes over and she says,"
Alissa: Oh my God!
"Brennan: And starts doing CPR. But you see that Misty's skin is flaking off into just like leaves and birch bark. And she goes,"
Alissa: Help! This is so bad. This is so bad.
"Sofia: I mean Alissa was really dumb, but I feel bad for her right now."
Misty: She was bad at her job and now she's finally doing something right. I don't see what the problem—
Ricky: Oh.
Pete: Wow.
Misty: All of you guys are taking this very poorly. This is cool.
"Sofia: No you're right, you're right."
Misty: I just did a very cool thing.
Kingston: This is not cool!
"Sofia: You're right, it is. It's only because I loved you as Misty Moore. But you know what, now I'm gonna know you before you were, whatever you were—"
Misty: Exactly.
Sofia: So that's very cool.
Kingston: You brought someone from the Fae into a populated Broadway show.
"Misty: No, no, no, that was not me. Somebody else put that mirror on the stage."
"Kingston: Well did you know? Did you— To what extent— Why couldn't we get anyone out, this seemed to— This thing happened, did you think it might happen? Did you know that Tatiana was after you?"
Misty: No!
"Kingston: When we were in the Fae, in that bar in the Fae."
"Misty: Yes. So Robin Goodfellow did send me the mirror, that... Titania and I may have had a little few words."
Pete: What haven't you told us? It feels like it could fill a book.
"Misty: I really, no, no, no. I mean look, should I have written my autobiography? Perhaps. People were."
Pete: Oh my God. I'm going to kill you. I hate how attractive you are now. Ugh!
Sofia: I would have bought it.
Kugrash: Because it's only going to get worse now she's young.
Siobhan: As I'm telling everybody this I'm just gently touching everybody.
Pete: Don't fucking— dont touch my heart like that.
Kingston: Don't touch me.
"Ricky: We should all come clean, right? I have something."
Sofia: Yeah come clean.
Pete: I fucking doubt it.
Kugrash: Is it that you have a crush on Esther?
Ricky: I should tell you guys that and—
"Misty: No, we know."
[chorus of ‘we know’]
Sofia: I'm probably going to become really good friends with Esther so I can try and put in a good word for you.
Ricky: [stuttering] If it comes naturally.
"Sofia: Oh, it will come naturally."
Ricky: Don't f-force it or whatever. Anyways. I just wanted to be honest.
[chiming music]
"Brennan: You begin to hear the chiming of the big floor piano over at FAO Schwarz and the ringing of bells. You can feel a little tug on your fae heartstrings of some kind of conclave or something being called over there and you see, creepily floating through the mist, their black eyes wide open, is Nod who floats through the mist and goes,"
Nod: [cheerfully] Hey Pete!
Pete: Hey.
Nod: [whispering creepily] The conclave.
Pete: What's going on at FAO Schwarz? What is? Oh.
"Nod: Oh, the conclave. It's a— It's a Fae conclave being called because one of the monarchs of Fae has been killed."
"Brennan: And you see that Nod looks down at the crown in your hand and says,"
"Nod: I'm afraid only Fae and the friends of Fae are welcome to come, but that might be all of you guys."
"Misty: I don't know, I mean you seemed pretty mean to— I'm just kidding."
"Pete: God, I hate you. I hate you."
Misty: I love bits!
"Brennan: Oh, incredible."
"Misty: [dancing a little] Ooh this new body loves bits, this is fun. Finding out new things."
"Brennan: An exuberant, Misty for the moment, walks by, you see the beautiful courtyard, you look out and see a whole row of wintery trees, ash, and birch, and rowan, out in Central Park. You walk to FAO Schwarz, you walk in. Huge toys everywhere and jangling things. You see that the faeries have kind of set themselves up into little minor courts here and there. There's a couple of very bashful-looking members of the pixie mafia who are looking around kind of scared of not having heard from their Don and knowing something's gone very bad."
Murph: I just point threateningly at one.
Pixie: Oh.
Murph: But just keep walking.
"Pixie: [hands up unthreateningly] Hey, it's no problem. I don't got no beef with you. I got no beef with you. Go ahead. Come on, you're a rat, we're pixies, we're family."
"Zac: I just start pushing Kugrash forward, like come on, come on. I'm just like, come on."
"Pete: He's not worth it, dog."
Murph: Creepy little rat points.
"Ricky: It's all right, we're okay."
"Siobhan: Waving at people like I know so many people here it's been such a long time. It's like,"
"Misty: Oh my God, how's your cousin? Oh my goodness. (screaming with happiness) Oh my God!"
"Brennan: Everyone's being, it's of course like your big day, so everyone's being very deferential."
Murph: Wait so she's young and she's gonna become a queen now? Misty just rules.
"Brennan: You see that, well that's what you get for a whole fight of me forcing you to make death saving throws and you rolling a nat 20."
"You guys see that there are also a little patch of kind of gross little sewer goblins and then there are also neon butterfly-winged faeries flitting around and spreading neon light everywhere. You see standing by this giant teddy bear, leaning against it, smoking a little thing of purple smoke out of a cigarette in his long camel-haired coat is Bobby Goodfellow."
"Misty: Bobby, darling."
"Bobby: You look great, what should I call you? Or do you want a second to figure it out?"
"Misty: No, I've been thinking about it. I was thinking Rowan."
Bobby: Ooh.
"Pete: That's such a hot, ah God, Fuck, I hate you now. Can I cast Minor Illusion to make you look like you used to?"
Siobhan: I cast Counterspell on your minor illusion.
"Pete: Ah, fuck you."
Siobhan: I'm burning a third level spell to get rid of your cantrip.
"Brennan: You see that Bobby says,"
"Bobby: You look fucking good, babe."
"Rowan: Darling, you look good."
"Bobby: Hey, so, we should get drinks after if you want."
Rowan: I'd love that.
"Bobby: I'll be happy to. I mean, I'm here for business right now, I'm sort of envoy of the Unseelie, but we'll talk later."
"Rowan: I mean, look, business and pleasure, that's what we do."
"Bobby: Hey, business is pleasure."
Rowan: The business of pleasure.
"Ally: I'm gonna barf, can I peel off? I want to check out something else."
"Brennan: Sure, you can peel off. You see also that all—"
Sofia: Can I come?
Pete: Yeah.
"Brennan: All by themselves is Nod, who is seated on a little cushion by themself sort of as their own court. But kinda looks up at you and waves."
Pete waves back.
"Brennan: You also see the last little court that appears is a little jack-in- the-box opens up and a bunch of little wind-up toys and chattering teeth come out and a bunch of the clock gnomes come out and all gather, you see Bilbry goes,"
"Bilbry: Oh, hey there friends. How's it going?"
"Rowan: Yeah but how's that oil, Bilberry?"
"Bilbry: Oh, it's much better now."
"Brennan: You see the High Priestess Hib-Hob comes out, she's got a huge priestess hat, but it's just a bunch of clockwork and gears all kinda stacked on one of those little water-dipping birds is on it. She goes,"
"Hib-Hob: Hello. Yes, drinking a lot more oil, Kingston you're right I do feel a lot better."
Kingston: I'm glad.
Ricky: Wonder if they have your motorcycle?
Kugrash: How’s the motorcycle?
Sofia: Oh and mine!
"Brennan: You see that Bilbry looks over and says,"
"Bilbry: I was thinking about an initial design of, and here we go over here."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Bilbry: So most motorcycles have wheels, right? But I was thinking, why not mix it up a bit. It's a pogo stick motorcycle. So it's a pogo stick on the front and a pogo stick on the back."
Rowan: I love it.
"Kugrash: Yeah, I mean, yeah."
Sofia: I like that. Can I have a special request for mine?
"Kugrash: I'm good, got it."
"Sofia: Can mine instead of wheels, have like arms so it looks like a person crawling?"
Bilbry: Now is that arms on the front and arms on the back? Like a four-arm no-leg monster nightmare?
Sofia: Yeah.
"Bilbry: Yes, I will get to work on that right away."
Sofia: I just made this a new friend and I feel like it would be a really good impression to show up to her place for the first time on it.
"Bilbry: 100%, more of a quad really. It's like an ATV but instead of wheels it's arms."
"Ally: Nightmare. Imagine reversing, it's like. [waves their arms, imitating a hands bike]"
Zac: Sounds like a Miyazaki...
"Brennan: You guys see that, Pete did you want to peel off and go do something else? Or?"
Ally: There's something I want to check out.
Brennan: Sure.
"Ally: If this is, can I do an Insight check to see if this is just a crowning ceremony."
"Brennan: Sure, yeah."
"Ally: 8, no 11."
"Brennan: 11, you don't think it's necessarily a crowning ceremony. It's probably that in addition to some other stuff."
"Ally: Okay, cool. I think I wanna talk with everyone."
"Pete: I wanna go and check out, I might have some new spells, so I wanna check out that weird thing at Hell. Like the Hellmouth that you guys found."
"Sofia: I would think that's fine.  I want to interrogate, I want to go and meet up with Esther at some point to interrogate Don Confetti but I'm thinking that won't happen anytime soon."
Pete: Maybe we can do both?
"Sofia: Yeah, let's see what's going on."
"Brennan: Cool, so who's going to go peel off with Pete and who's going to stay with Rowan?"
Emily: I'll peel off with Pete.
"Brennan: Cool, Sofia and Pete peel off."
Murph: I'll chill.
Brennan: The rest of you guys remain here.
Ally: I'll be the muscle.
"Brennan: You see that Nod stands. You guys head off. Nod stands and says,"
"Nod: The conclave is now called to order. As a neutral party and monarch of the realm of Dreams, I invite our faerie guests here to witness the rebirth of Miss Rowan… [stares questioningly at Rowan]"
Rowan: Berry.
Nod: Berry. And the creation of a new Fae realm.
"[somber, dream-like music]"
"Brennan: You see that, Nod looks to you and says,"
"Nod: As you have defeated the Lady Titania with the assistance of your heroic mortal friends, I would offer to you that your new position is yours to make. These courts have assembled and ask on behalf of what they represent for the right to petition you and give council before your decision is made."
"Rowan: Sure, speak out."
"Brennan: You see that a tiny little neon faerie, [bzz!] little buzzing wings says,"
"Aquamarine: [very high voice, cutesy] Hi, I am Aquamarine and as a representative, as a representative of the Seelie court I bow to you as that as the one who has defeated the former queen of the Seelie."
"Rowan: Just to be clear to everybody here, she attacked me. This is not me attacking her. I didn't want to kill her, but she was very actively trying to kill me and all of my friends."
"Aquamarine: Straight up? No hard feelings, because I will be very honest and I don't liked and I'm not—"
"Rowan: Oh no, we don't mean to speak ill of the dead but also we're among friends."
"Aquamarine: And I feel really hard, especially hard to say this because obviously as someone, like I respect Titania so much and obviously—"
"Rowan: Oh, I respected the shit out of Titania."
"Aquamarine: And all she accomplished. And this is such a, this is a thing that gets said about a lot of powerful female spirits and forces of nature..."
"Rowan: Trill, she was very—"
Aquamarine: She was very hard to work with.
Rowan: Yeah.
Aquamarine: She was very hard to work with.
"Rowan: Hard to work with, just like my way or the highway."
"Aquamarine: Yeah, and there's just no room for kind of talking about things and other idea because like, my whole thing is like anyone in the room could have the idea."
Rowan: Right. It's like delegation is so important in leadership I feel like and she made so much more work for herself while being like I only have this one idea.
Aquamarine: It's so amazing that you're this beautiful and so down to earth.
Rowan: [touched] Stop!
"Brennan: You see that Bobby Goodfellow goes,"
"Bobby: All right, all right, I gotta. My name's Bobby Goodfellow, as representative of the Unseelie court I come from Lord Oberon with his—"
Rowan: Is he bad?
"Bobby: I mean, I've heard things about—"
"Rowan: Because it's not like he didn't cheat. You know what I mean? Like he's not, it's not like a marriage that was good. Again, I don't want to speak ill of the dead."
"Bobby: Listen, they opened it up hundreds of years ago and then—"
"Rowan: Okay, right, but was she happy about that?"
"Bobby: I don't know, I think it was one of those things where it was kinda like we either open it up or we end it."
Rowan: Right.
"Bobby: So it's like, that's not fair, right?"
Rowan: Yeah.
Bobby: That's why I'm never getting married. In any case—
"Ricky: Hey Kugrash, what do they mean by open it up?"
Murph: (laughs) I explain it for a long time. And while I just like—
Ally: You get like deep into compersion.
Murph: I might as well explain to both of you and I take Wally and Ricky aside.
Multiple: Wally's here?
"Brennan: No, Wally is not here."
"Murph: Okay, just Ricky then."
"Brennan: You see that Bobby Goodfellow says,"
"Bobby: We would ask that because the Unseelie depend upon the Seelie to both define and oppose ourselves, we would ask that you return the crown to us, and in exchange we will acknowledge and recognize the sovereignty of New York as your own realm and Lord Oberon would be willing to grant you three boons."
"Rowan: I'm sorry, let me get this right. You want me, the person who doesn't believe in the monarchy, but is still of the Seelie, to give the crown over to the Unseelie court and then I just get three favors."
"Bobby: I mean they're full boons so, you know."
"Rowan: Yeah, I hear you. But again, I’m an immortal being. Three for a lifetime doesn't seem like that many."
"Brennan: You see that Bobby says,"
Bobby: I personally question whether you are fully Seelie or not.
Rowan: Well I question whether you are fully Unseelie.
"Brennan: You see that the Seelie faerie speaks up again, Aquamarine, and goes,"
"Aquamarine: I just again want to say that, no our offer would be that you keep the crown and just refound the Seelie court here in New York as its queen and sole monarch."
"Brennan: You see that Bobby goes,"
Bobby: Let's make it clear. Rowan Berry is a vampiric entity. She feeds off of the hope and joy and passion of the worship and adoration of mortals. She's Unseelie if anything.
"Rowan: Oh please. I give people hope, I give people courage, I lift people's hearts when they live in darkness. That's the most Seelie thing for somebody to do."
"Brennan: You see that Nod stands up at this moment where you say this and Nod looks at you and goes,"
"Nod: You're right. Miss Berry, I'm not Fae but I would like to show you something if I can."
Rowan: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: And you see that Nod says, or Nod goes and magic courses from their hands and they say,"
"Nod: To rebut the words of the honorable Bobby Goodfellow, I dispute the claim that Rowan Berry or any of her former incarnations were parasites or vampires."
Brennan: And Rowan you see visions from all over the world of young kids in their bedrooms singing into the mirror with your poster up.
Rowan: [wiping the very corner of her eye] I do it for them. I do it all for them.
"Brennan: (laughs), You see girls in the back of a minivan on the way to a summer camp asking their mom to put the CD of the original cast recording on. I don't know if Rowan or Misty actually believed that line, but you see incontrovertible proof that you have not taken more than you've given. And you look out and you see that Nod speaks and says,"
"Nod: It is true that, like many entities, Miss Berry has sustained herself on worship. But it is a cynical and small soul that believes that worship diminishes the soul of the worshipper. All of the people who have loved Misty Moore and who will love Rowan Berry have had their hearts and—"
Rowan: We'll see.
Nod: (laughs) Have had their hearts enlarged and their lives enriched through the act of their devotion. It does not diminish a soul to give worship or adoration and everything that has sustained Miss Berry has been given back tenfold to sustain those who found their strength through her.
Siobhan: I stand up and give a slow clap.
"Rowan: Nobody else? No? Just me, alright."
"Brennan: Nod looks over and says,"
Nod: I believe the clock gnomes have a rather intriguing offer as a third option.
Rowan: Wonderful.
"Brennan: You see that the High Priestess Hib-Hob says,"
"Hib-Hob: Well, if you wanted, we would be happy to take the crown and if you wanted a Fae realm of your own to shape it into something more to your liking if you wished."
"Rowan: Why are we talking about what I want? I'm so, this is America this is the land of hope and dreams of democracy. And we're coming here and saying that I get to create a court and I'm leading this court and no. Absolutely not. The will of the people must stand."
"Brennan: All of the faeries are looking around. There's a big hubbub. You see that there's one weird pile of leaves just literally going,"
"Pile of Leaves: Hubbub, hubbub, hubbub, hubbub."
Ricky: [scared] Ah!
Pile of Leaves: Ah!
"Brennan: You see that Nod stands up, raps their fist on this little table next to them and says,"
Nod: Then let there be a vote!
"Brennan: A bunch of little wisps of paper and a little ballot box in the middle open up. You see that there are three options on it. One is to return the crown to the Unseelie. The other is to wear the crown and become Monarch of the Seelie here. And the third is to found a Fae court, with the blessing of Nod and have the crown reshaped by the clock gnomes into something else. You see that Nod distributes ballots to Kugrash, Kingston, and Ricky,"
"Ricky: I have a question about this. Hi, I'm Ricky. I'm not sure what any of this is. When you say reshaping it into something else what does that mean?"
Hib-Hob: Like a gun or a watch or a bicycle or really sort of anything you want.
Ricky: But could it be a democracy or does it have to be a—
"Brennan: You see that Bobby Goodfellow speaks up and says,"
"Bobby: The Unseelie and the Seelie have been monarchies forever because that is the nature of how they were created. If you were to found something new and to found that as a democracy that's the business of this new realm, whatever it would be."
"Ricky: Okay, thank you."
"Bobby: I don't want to go too fast for you, does that all make sense?"
Ricky: I think so. Bobby?
"Bobby: Bobby, yeah."
"Ricky: Ricky, sir."
"Bobby: Ricky, how's it going?"
"Rowan: Also I just wanna say, whatever happens, I just wanna still be an actor. I love the stage. I don't wanna, whatever situation that we find ourselves in I don't know if I wanna do that forever. Maybe I could pull a Glenda Jackson and be in politics for and go back and do Lear."
"Brennan: You see that Aquamarine says,"
Aquamarine: Well if you were queen of the Seelie we would kinda need—
Rowan: Right.
Aquamarine: You to be queen.
"Brennan: And you see that Nod says,"
Nod: I don't have any input on what the shape of the Fae realm in New York would look like after your decision.
Emily: [quietly] Install Wally.
Siobhan: I'm so glad you're not really here.
(everyone laughs)
Siobhan: My inner Sofia is whispering all of the worst advice in my ear.
Rowan’s Inner Sofia: Wally for Queen of the Fae!
Brennan: You see that faeries start putting their votes in the ballot box.
"Rowan: It seems to me that the suggestion to build a Fae world of our own, it worries me that I'm the only operative but that could also be a democratic process."
"Brennan: You see that Nod affirms that and they say,"
Nod: Being the founder of something is a manifestation of the powerful magic you've created. But being the founder is not the same as being a leader. You could create something and step away from it if that was your heart's desire.
Rowan’s Inner Sofia: Wally World.
Ally: It's a real place in Holland.
Emily: [excited] Really?
"Kugrash: Let's just make sure we don't split the vote, I feel like right now the third party candidate is making you the queen of New York and we don't want this crown to go to the Unseelie so maybe we should all get on the same page here."
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and let me know how you guys vote."
Kingston: I've generally found the relationship to the Fae as it has been to be beneficial for New York. So I will vote in favor of giving the crown to the Seelie.
Zac: That's an option too?
Emily: You mean to the Unseelie?
"Lou: No, to the Seelie."
"Brennan: So their option is that you would become queen and rule the Seelie here, so it's option two."
Zac: And would you have to live in their realm?
"Siobhan: Yeah, pretty much."
"Murph: I guess I'll vote for the, Kugrash votes to give it to the gnomes."
Zac: Same with Ricky.
"Brennan: Ricky votes for the gnomes, you voted for the gnomes. How does Misty vote?"
"Siobhan: I mean, I'm going to go gnomes."
"Brennan: You see the ballet's created. You see that Bobby Goodfellow says,"
"Bobby: Hey, it was worth a shot. I'm staying at the plaza, so."
"Rowan: Yeah, no fuss, no worry."
Bobby: No worries.
Brennan: You see Bobby—
"Rowan: I respect your hustle, Bobby."
"Bobby: Hey, you know, I gotta make moves while I can, I'm not in New York for that long."
"Brennan: You see, he goes over, you see that Aquamarine flies over to you and gives a little kiss on your ringed hand, sort of crying."
"Aquamarine: [sniffs] Well, I don't—"
"Brennan: The ballot comes out and the clock gnomes start celebrating as the clock gnome option wins. You see that Aquamarine cries a little bit and wipes her tears away. You see that she looks up to you and says,"
Aquamarine: I understand why you made the choice you did.
"Rowan: Aquamarine, I would love for you to come and be a voice in the formation of this new Fae. I think it's really important to have all of the voices represented, not just the voices of change but the voices of stability."
"Brennan: You see that Aquamarine's eyes light up and she says,"
"Aquamarine: I will serve you, may I ask of a favor of you in exchange for my service, for as long as there shall be time."
"Rowan: [shaking her head] Ooh, a faerie asking a favor. Sure, just this once, go ahead."
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Aquamarine: I will gladly serve you, the favor I ask, if you have taken Lady Titania's crown as is your right, if her shoes could be returned so that they might choose a new leader for us in a leader's absence."
Rowan: I'm so sorry. You are asking to create a second monarchy within Faerie. I think that we did not vote for that.
Zac: Can I do a Perception check?
"Brennan: Yeah, do a Perception."
"Zac: [casually] Okay, nat 20."
(group exclamation)
Brennan: You see that—
Ally: Another day another 20.
"Brennan: You see that there doesn't appear to be anything foul or wicked happening here. You see that Aquamarine says,"
"Aquamarine: You're right, we didn't vote on it, but."
Ricky: Are you worried about what will happen to the Seelie place?
"Aquamarine: Without a monarch, there's nothing to protect us from the Unseelie. And I know it's sneaky but [wiggling a finger on her face] you did give me a favor."
Rowan: But we didn't agree that we would. (mumbles) Fucking faeries.
Brennan: You begin to feel the magic of Faerie closing in on you.
Rowan: Shit. God these fucking people. Here is what I will agree on. Fuck. Um—
Rowan’s Inner Sofia: Give the shoes to Wally.
Ally: You are not here.
Rowan: Goddamn. Why is the only thing that I can think—
Ally: We're at a coffee shop.
Rowan: Is the bad ideas that Sofia would have.
Zac: She’s the leaves.
Rowan: Tell you what. While I am the leader of the court I need the shoes in New York.
"Aquamarine: If you get something to replace the shoes and don't need them anymore, then a deal’s a deal. How does that sound?"
"Rowan: On the other agreement that the leader of the court in New York is the leader of the court of Seelie, and anybody who sets themselves up as a leader of Seelie is a pretender."
Aquamarine: Okay.
Rowan: And they're committing an illegal act.
Aquamarine: Okay.
"Brennan: You see that she says,"
Aquamarine: I'm just not gonna see my people destroyed because both their artifacts are gone. That's all.
Rowan: I get it. I get it.
Aquamarine: And I know that I'm small and cute but I'm not a pushover and I'm not a dummy so.
Rowan: Please. Hey look. You think I haven't been ignored because I'm small and cute.
Aquamarine: You're small?
"Rowan: In comparison to these humans, absolutely."
"Brennan: She shrugs and says,"
"Aquamarine: Okay, take whatever time you need but let me know when those shoes become free."
"Brennan: And you see that she flits off. You see the clock gnomes come over and say,"
"Clock Gnome: Well, let us know what you want us to shape the crown into and we'll be happy to do it."
"Rowan: Oh yeah, no, I'll have a little thought, how about… Ooh."
"Clock Gnome: No rush, take your time."
"Rowan: I just don't want it to get passé, you know? You want something that has some lasting oomph to it."
Clock Gnome: I understand.
Rowan: What if you get a snap band and then snap bands aren't cool anymore?
Clock Gnome: Snap bands will always be cool. [slaps a snap band on their wrist]
"Rowan: You know, you're right. Snap bands will always be cool."
"Brennan: You guys walk from this place as the conclave ends, you bestowed with this new power."
Siobhan: Can I have a look at this crown? I don't know what it does except for.
Brennan: It doesn't have a trigger on it to shoot spells out of it.
Lou: Bang!
Brennan: It does just have the power of that station. Of being like a lord or lady of Faerie. We're gonna cut over to Sofia and Pete. You guys are dipping out into Nod. What do you guys do as you go out into Nod?
"Emily: I mean, I'm in general just kinda acting aggressive."
Ally: What!
[cast laughing]
Emily: Because I'm your escort.
"Ally: Oh, because you said you would be my muscle."
Emily: Yeah.
"Pete: Look, Sofia, I've been working out a lot okay?"
Sofia: I know.
Pete: I even worked out with Ricky once.
Sofia: You look awesome.
Pete: And it was a nightmare. Thank you.
"Sofia: I honestly wanted to join you guys, it sounds super fun."
Pete: You should definitely come.
"Sofia: I used to do Zumba, and then my favorite teacher left because she had a kid."
Pete: It makes all the difference who's the teacher.
Sofia: Exactly.
"Pete: Absolutely. Okay, I want to check out where that growth is that Kugrash told us about."
"Brennan: You see it spreading throughout the city but you can follow it to the heart of the infection. And yeah, you see it spreads from the golden door hanging over the city, the rectangular golden light."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: And you see that this weird, suspended in plasma and blood crumpled and strung out dollars and cents, sludge of money moving throughout the Dream realm. But you arrive at the heart of the infection near the middle of Manhattan."
"Ally: Cool, can I do an Insight?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Ally: Great, that is a 22."
Brennan: Awesome. What is Pete trying to glean? You definitely see it in its fullness. You're using your Vox Phantasma authority to look through the Dream realm and see all the places that it's going.
Ally: I wanna see who put it there and what purpose it's serving.
"Brennan: With a 22 you can see that people put it there. It does not appear that some single malevolent force created this but rather some malevolent forces have taken advantage of this being here and propagated it. In other words, it is this weird psychic growth on top of this dream of the golden door. In other words it's not like, “oh the Dream world was great and lovely and then some evil money thing came and made there be a money infection”. It's like no this poison has always flirted around the edges of what this dream meant. But rather than forces creating it, you can see they're forces tapped into it that are siphoning energy and power off of it. And there's a couple throughout this city but a bunch of the deepest most powerful roots are way downtown."
Ally: Where Moses is.
"Emily: I take out, I have a lip gloss that's almost done. So I just wanna scoop up the very last of it, put on a layer and then I'd like to scoop some of the sludge into my lip gloss file."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: So that I have a little bit of it.
"Brennan: Yep, you get a nasty little vial of this toxic money sludge."
Ally: So this is running money to where and like from?
"Brennan: Yeah, exactly. It's basically this thing, like before when we were talking about the rat race that you guys found in Hell. Basically what this is is it's like the archetypal dream here is prosperity, happiness, thriving, a home, this and that. All the stuff that people want. And then this infection is like, oh you need me to get that. And then eventually blinds and corrupts people where they're like, forget the thing they were getting money to get."
Ally: Can I see what happens if I shoot it?
Sofia: I was gonna say maybe we should eat a little bit.
Pete: [horrified] What the fuck?
Brennan: By the way—
"Sofia: Just a little bit, like a little taste to see if it has an effect."
Pete: Are you? No that's too scary for me but go for it if you want. I'm gonna shoot it and then maybe a slice will—
"Sofia: Okay well let's shoot it first, I'll Mage Hand it you shoot it and we'll see what happens."
Brennan: You go to shoot some of it with your gun and—
"Siobhan: Don't eat it! I have a much more sensible idea, I'm gonna shoot it."
Brennan: You see by the way that as you go to collect some you see that some of this stuff is coming out of you. You look at your backpack and see all the bricks and stuff that you reupped from 53V3N and a strong—
"Ally: This is capitalism. So it's just, I'm seeing a—"
Emily: Is any coming from me?
Ally: Physical manifestation of capitalism.
"Brennan: There's a tiny little thread or tether going to your purse. But it's not, there's like a thick nasty root coming out of the block. You got a 22 on your Insight right?"
Ally: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: You look down at it, you see that like some of the—"
"Ally: (gasps in realization) Sorry, go on."
"Brennan: No, no, no. You see that it appears to be connecting to some of it more powerfully than others."
Sofia: The cherry tomatoes… Ready to play the contrabassoon.
"Brennan: There's like a little bit of, there's like some of the weed in your bag has like a very thin little trail to the thicker one. You see the cocaine and the heroine have these thick rooted things. And as you look down you take out your gun, blam, blast one of the thick arteries and you look down and see a wall against a warehouse somewhere, someone being pushed up against it and being shot in the back of the head. As you can see that they were dragged out of a jeep for trying to escape from this cocaine harvesting operation."
"Pete: Great. Okay, yeah. Fully like late capitalism. Okay cool, I've found what I want. Did you wanna go do something?"
Brennan: Go ahead and make a Wisdom saving throw for me real quick.
Ally: Great. What do I add to that?
"Murph: Add two, so 16."
Ally: 16.
"Brennan: 16, cool. You see that this fuckin’ brick of shit in your bag, the thing you're seeing is not unrelated, that's like the history of this brick of cocaine. It's like, oh someone made this, tried to escape, and the people—"
"Ally: They're forced to scrape plants and they were, yeah, fuck."
Brennan: And then ran the fuck away and was shot and killed for trying to escape. What's going on with Pete right now?
Ally: I'm bummed. By my life choices. I'm confused and I'm also really bored. Because I haven't been high in a really long time.
"Sofia: I mean, I've got honestly a lot of nips on me if you want something."
"Pete: I would, but I just am like—"
Sofia: Be my guest.
Pete: Am I bored or am I running away?
"Sofia: You're right, sometimes you need to be bored to figure out what's going on."
"Pete: It's true, thank you. Do you have like a Malibu rum though? The alcohol content—"
"Sofia: I do, I do."
"Pete: Is so low, I would love just a sip."
Sofia: The coconut one is pretty much cocaine.
Pete: It tastes like sunscreen.
"Brennan: What was the revelation Pete had a second, it looked like you and Pete recognized something. You went like, (gasps)."
"Ally: Yeah, it sounded like some of the stuff that 53V3N got was infected."
Brennan: Yeah.
Ally: So was this a specific thing or was it just tied to the cocaine because that's like the least ethically harvested and spot and sold.
Brennan: It seems like that's the thing you see.
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: And you see it also in a lot of other, as you're just looking through Nod, you see it coming out of some forms of retail stores like it's attached to like fucking—"
Ally: Slave labor?
"Brennan: Yeah, exactly. You see there's like a diamond—"
Ally: It's the ethics.
"Emily: I was gonna say like can I have some diamond earrings that I swear to God they're real diamonds, can I hold them up and see?"
Brennan: One of them has a thick nasty root of evil. There's a diamond on your ring that has a thick nasty root of evil and then your two diamond earrings have got nothing.
Sofia: So I guess some diamonds are bad and some are—
Pete: Some diamonds are real.
Sofia: Oh my God.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see two pieces of glass—"
Pete: Your ear is bright green.
Sofia: (laughs) I thought that was because the diamond was just—
Pete: Diamonds don't do that.
Sofia: Casting a green—
"Pete: No, no, diamonds don’t do that."
Sofia: A green kiss of the real diamond.
Pete: The green kiss of a real diamond? Is that what you were just saying?
"Sofia: Yeah, that's the thing we say in Staten Island. Okay, let's head back."
"[whimsical, chiming music]"
"Brennan: Cool. You guys head back, as you guys are catching the L train back out of Nod, heading towards, I presume the Clinton Hill Chantry where Esther is. What do you guys go ahead, what do you guys say when you meet up at the train station?"
Pete: What happened.
Rowan: Wild day.
"Sofia: Oh yeah, how did it all go?"
"Rowan: So, I think that we're gonna instigate some kind of faerie democracy, we'll see how it goes, I don't know, sometimes you instigate a democracy and it goes well and sometimes it doesn't."
"Kugrash: Yeah, the gnomes are doing their work."
"Rowan: Yeah, I like the gnomes, they seem pretty stable."
Ally: Can I roll to hide how big of a crush I have on new Misty?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Ally: What would that be, Deception?"
Brennan: That would be Deception.
Ally: 18.
"Brennan: 18, cool, go ahead and give me an Insight check. Miss Rowan Berry."
Siobhan: Do I get advantage on seeing other people's Deception?
"Brennan: No, I don't think you do."
Siobhan: Insight?
Brennan: Insight.
Siobhan: 21.
BRennan: Pete is hornt up.
Siobhan: I take Pete's cowboy hat—
Emily: What's the height difference?
Siobhan: And I put it on.
"Pete: Stop it, give me that back. God, you're so dumb!"
Rowan: Doesn't it suit me? Don't you think it looks cute?
"Ricky: Pete, why do you think she's dumb?"
"Pete: I don't know, I'm just, it's weird when your friend all of a sudden is completely different."
"Rowan: Ricky, put some clothes on."
"Pete: Yeah, Ricky you were naked in that whole judge—"
"Sofia Okay, okay, let him come around to it on his own time."
"Ricky: I keep forgetting, sorry."
Pete: (laughs) You keep forgetting.
"Rowan: It's all right, you're fine."
"Pete: Oh, I forgot."
"Brennan: Lovely, you guys get to the Clinton Hill Chantry, you walk up."
"Frank: Oh, hi Ricky, how's it going man?"
Brennan: Frank.
"Ricky: Hey Frank, how's it going?"
"Frank: Good, you know. Can't complain. Getting pretty cold out here, a little frost behind the old knocker but you know, it is what it is."
"Ricky: I said I'd bring you a sandwich, didn't I?"
"Frank: Hey, man. It's not a problem."
"Ricky: Next time I come, I'm gonna bring in two sandwiches, I'm sorry about that."
"Frank: Oh man, see this is why I like you man, you're such a good guy. You're real, New York's bravest man, I love it. It's great. You know it's funny, the other day I was talking they got a—"
Ricky: Yeah?
(knocking on door)
(Brennan coughing)
"Ricky: Keep going, I'm sorry."
"Brennan: Door swings open. You guys walk in, see that there's a large room in the chantry, Esther's moved one of the tables so that in the center of the floor there's this runic magic circle. And Don Confetti with his hands tied up behind his back, is sitting [plops down in his chair] in the middle of this little circle. Very unimpressive looking now that he's not surrounded by his pixie mafia. He looks at all you guys as you come in, he goes,"
Don Confetti: I'm not talking with nobody. I'm not saying nothing without my lawyer.
"Brennan: The door closes (door squeaking) and he goes,"
"Don Confetti: I will fully cooperate with everything you wanna do, I will spill all the beans, please, please help me."
"Rowan: Darling, I'm so glad that you're being sensible about this."
Don Confetti: All I wanna do is help. I regret my life of tiny crime.
Ally: Tiny crime… [laughs]
"Zac: Can I just add, cast Zone of Truth on him."
Murph: That's a good call.
Emily Oh yeah.
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Sure.
"Zac: Yeah, I cast Zone of Truth."
"Brennan: You feel him fail. You feel the spell come into effect. So Ricky, you stand up and command this zone of honesty around you. What does Ricky creating a zone of honesty look like? [laughing]"
Ally: How big is the zone?
Zac: It's a 15 foot radius.
Lou: Oh sweet.
"Ally: Are we all in it? I'm like I'm trying to back up a little bit,"
Siobhan: Oh no.
Brennan: I think we need some Wisdom saving throws from you guys.
"Emily: Oh, I got a nat 20."
"Lou: I'm all good, 22."
"Siobhan: Yeah I’m good, 21."
Murph: 21.
Emily: What a waste of a nat 20 though.
Ally: 19.
Brennan: I'm gonna say roll with disadvantage because you're rattled by Rowan over here.
"Ally: God damn it. um 14, 13\."
"Brennan: 13\. Pete, you fail. You fail to save."
"Pete: Rowan, are you gonna start studying—"
Siobhan: I scratch the back of your head.
Pete: Stop. Are you gonna start studying acting again or what's your schedule gonna be like?
"Rowan: I don't know, isn't it so exciting?"
Pete: That's so exciting.
Ricky: [very seriously] Don Confetti.
[cast laughs]
Siobhan: I cast Minor Illusion so we all look like the really ultra hot DAs from Law and Order. Just like really well-fitted lawyer suits.
"Pete: Oh my God, cool."
"Don Confetti: Yeah, yes sir, so sorry."
Ricky: [a little similarly to a lawyer] I command you to tell the truth!
Pete: Did you get southern all of a sudden?
Ricky: To tell the truth.
Brennan: You see him—
Siobhan: He is but a humble southern lawyer.
Brennan: You see--
Zac: He's got suspenders on.
Brennan: He then goes
"Don Confetti: I don't know if you're speaking on behalf of the fire department or if you're legally allowed to make these demands but I accept, I submit to your authority and I agree. What is it you wanna know?"
"Rowan: Ducky, what's going on?"
[suspenseful music]
"Don Confetti: Okay, here's basically what's going on. I was sent here a long time ago by Titania to basically oversee some faerie business here in the city. You had run away and you were here with the shoes and that was the thing I was maybe supposed to consider, you know looking after. But when I got here, very quickly Robert Moses, he was at that time not a businessman, he was actually the head of a lot of civic organizations that had to do with infrastructure and he was responsible for building all the major highways in New York."
"Rowan: See, the banality of evil. That is so Goddamn boring."
Don Confetti: Yeah he got all of the—
"Rowan: Course the most evil guy is the guy that built the highways, so dull."
"Don Confetti: Yeah he's real bad. But he built the highways and pretty soon the highways made it so that the tiny little people like that couldn't come here, you know what I mean? So I—"
"Rowan: Potato, Potahto."
"Don: So when the cat is prevented from accessing you because of a series of highways in a shape of a hex, the mice will play! And... so you remember how Faerie pays a tithe to Hell, about 10% of what faerie makes has been paid to Hell part of an old agreement. I stopped paying my taxes to Titania when the highway hex was finished. And Robert Moses has found out and they did me for tax evasion, can you believe it? Me, a mafia boss."
Rowan: [stammers] I get it.
Sofia: So you were working with Hell because they had something on you?
"Don Confetti: I was working with Hell because unlike Faerie, they had somebody on the ground here in New York."
"Pete: Who, Bob Moses?"
Sofia: Bob Moses?
Kugrash: Was it Robert Moses?
"Don Confetti: Isabella Infierno, who was working for Bob Moses. So that bag I gave to your brother that was them, Bicicletas have been ferrying my tenth, my tithe to Isabella. Unbeknownst to me, I found this out in the last day or two, she wasn't giving any of that back to Hell."
Sofia: Where was she bringing it to?
Don Confetti: Well a lot of those magical stuff and ritual gear and yada yada yada.
Sofia: She was just spending it on herself.
Don Confetti: On herself and on Mr Moses.
"Rowan: See this is what you gotta do. You go in, you get the gig, you say pay me half as a check and then you get half of it in cash and then you pay the taxes on the check."
Ricky: You're kinda sounding like your old self again.
Kugrash: It sounds like Robert Moses is trying to play both sides and then protect himself—
Rowan: Really he's just.
Sofia: He's just trying to create his own realm that he has ultimate control of.
Kugrash:  And stop Hell and Faerie from getting in here so that he can kinda rule everything or rule New York unopposed.
"Rowan: King of New York, huh?"
Don Confetti: Looks like it.
Rowan: I don't like it.
"Pete: So then that would put you against him, probably."
"Rowan: I mean I've been against him. Oh, I should tell you, he did come and visit me on Christmas Day."
Pete: What?
Sofia: Like for what reason?
"Rowan: Real big boy, I'm the boss around here, kinda moves. Nothing solid. He didn't say anything real."
Sofia: We should go visit him.
Don Confetti: But you're all right. Robert Moses didn't try to play Faerie and Hell against each other. He successfully played Faerie and Hell against each other.
Sofia: How does Heaven factor into this? Is Robert Moses playing them at all?
"Don Confetti: No, not that I'm aware of."
"Brennan: But, he says,"
"Don Confetti: That was the one kinda hole in his plan was the idea of, he knew how to play this game with Hell and Faerie, but you can't sell your soul to Heaven, they won't buy a soul. So, basically he had to find someway to square his soul with Heaven that wouldn't have to do with--"
Ricky: The list!
"[dream-like, somber music]"
Sofia: The fountain. Or the list.
"Don Confetti: Oh, yeah that'll work. That for sure."
Kugrash: Do you know where the list is?
Don: All that stuff that we took went to Moses.
"Rowan: Oh, so you did take that."
Don Confetti: The list we took.
"Sofia: And the pixies that went down for that, was that just a favor, you just threw those guys under the bus."
Don Confetti: They'll be well taken care of on the inside. Sometimes members of the family gotta take a fall for the organization.
Rowan: What about the clock gnomes? Was that you guys too?
Siobhan: I pull out the little baggie of pixie dust.
(magical chiming)
"Brennan: As you pull out the pixie stuff, you can automatically see that it sort of sprinkles off."
(magical chiming)
"Rowan: Oh yeah, this looks right."
"Brennan: You see he shrugs and says,"
Don Confetti: Moses wanted the [his accent makes this even harder to pronounce] Big Book of Bits and Bubbas.
Rowan: The what?
Kingston: Moses wanted the Big Book of Bugs and Baubles?
Sofia:The Big Book of Bits and Bubbles.
Don Confetti: Are you making fun of my speech impediment?
Kingston: No it's called the Big Book of Bits and Baubles right?
Don Confetti: The Big Book of Bits and Baubles.
Ricky: Yeah the Big Book of—
Rowan: The Big Book of Bits and Baubles?
Kingston: We all know about the Big Book of Bits and Baubles.
Rowan: We all know what it's called and we know how to say it.
Don Confetti: Yes. Exactly.
"Pete: So he has everything now right? He's got the list, he has the ability to make a stone."
Sofia: He has the key to the city.
Kingston: He has a key to the city.
Rowan: The time stone.
Sofia: He's got the time stone.
Kingston: Where is he?
"Don Confetti: Your guess is as good as mine, he doesn't give me his location. We had drop off points."
Ricky: Do you know where he's—
"Sofia: Esther, you got a read on where he might be?"
"Brennan: You see that Esther shrugs and goes,"
"Esther: [sighs] I wouldn't know where to start looking for him, but."
"Brennan: She goes,"
"Esther: If only we still had it, but it's been missing for years."
Rowan: What?
Esther: The Sardinian Eagle.
Rowan: The Sardinian Eagle?
Sofia: I like that.
Esther: The Sardinian Eagle was an artifact. It's an extremely powerful artifact that can help locate and find areas of extreme magical importance. If we think that there's a chance that Moses is going to do some kind of ritual or cast some kind of important spell then the Sardinian Eagle would be able to help us find that location.
Kingston: What's it look like?
Esther: I believe the Sardinian Eagle was—
"Emily is staring at Lou knowingly, giggling. Lou looks resigned."
Kingston: Looks like a bird?
Ricky: Was it up someone's—
Sofia: Someone’s ass?
Rowan: Someone's butt?
"Kingston: I know where it is, y'all ain't gonna like that. Y'all ain't gonna like where it is, but I know where it is."
Esther: You know the Sardinian Eagle? We need to get our hands on it as soon as possible.
Kingston: Oh we don't wanna get anyone's hands on it.
Sofia: I think we wanna cover—
"Kugrash: Why? Well, I'll put my hands on it."
"Ricky: Grab it as soon as we can, what are you talking about?"
"Kingston: No we're not, nobody wants to put their hands on this."
"Pete: Can I ask the question? Where is Bob Moses from? Which realm is his, where he's from?"
"Don Confetti: From my understanding, Mr Moses is a powerful form of undead."
"Rowan: Wow, but he's not a vampire. Because I can see him."
Sofia:So the undead aren't necessarily from Hell. That's kind've like their own breed.
Don Confetti: Exactly.
"Rowan: They're from our plane, right?"
Don Confetti: The undead--
"Sofia: Oh, perhaps they're creating an undead realm."
Don: You might say that the undead are more committed to being from Earth than even the living are. They sure have a hard time letting go.
Kugrash: That’s really insightful.
Don Confetti: I wanna point something out.
Rowan: No judgment or anything.
Don Confetti: I know that I got clowned pretty hard in the last fight. I've been running a very successful mafia organization for decades.
"Rowan: Look darling, who are you talking with?"
Sofia: You threw your daughter a beautiful wedding.
"Don Confetti: Thank you, I actually put a lot of thought, and she's my fifth daughter to be married and we didn't skimp on an expense because—"
Rowan: It was really beautiful.
"Sofia: You could feel that when you were there, it didn't feel like you chose favorites."
Rowan: It was truly magical.
Don Confetti: I am a bad man. I'm a bad man.
"Sofia: I know, I think you're a fucking piece of shit."
Don Confetti: I won't--
Sofia: After this I am going to beat you up.
Don Confetti: I am a piece of shit—
Rowan: No!
Don: And you are welcome to beat the shit out of me.
"Sofia: Yeah, I'm going to."
Don: I can't stop you.
Sofia: I've got a fucking spell slot left.
"Pete: I'm like, hey, come on Sofia."
Don Confetti: Everyone should feel like a princess on her special day. [points to the Zone of Truth] And I believe that 100%.
"Pete: That's... great. Okay, so Bob Moses really wanted me to work with him. Should I pretend like I've flipped? Should I go meet him?"
Kingston: I can also get the Sardinian Eagle.
"Kugrash: Yeah, let's get the, I think trying to trick some crazy primordial being is just gonna blow up in our faces."
Kingston: We have knowledge that he knows about us. He probably at some point knows that you just said what you just said.
"Kugrash: Pete, you can't even hide the fact that you've got a crush on Rowan."
Pete: I fucking don't.
"Rowan: What, no, Pete would never!"
"Ricky: Hey, you're under the Zone of Truth right now."
Lou: Can I text like somebody in clerical stuff—
"Pete: I do, I have a huge crush on you, who are you?"
Lou: At the hospital—
"Rowan: Fine, you know who I am."
Lou: To Lowell Master's address?
"Brennan: You shoot a text over to Emiko, Ricky's sister, and she texts back and says."
"Emiko: Yeah, he hasn't been in in a while. Why, are you worried about something?"
Pete: Fuck.
"Kingston: Yeah, based on our last visit I just wanna check up on him."
"Rowan: He's probably lives pretty close to the location of your hospital, right?"
"Kingston: Yeah, well I just wanna get his—"
Rowan: I have a spell.
"Kugrash: You have a bag, the Bagel."
Kingston: I can text somebody and get an address real quick.
"Brennan: Yeah, you get—"
Rowan: Oh but you can use magic.
"Kingston: Nobody asked me. Nobody needs to use magic, we don't have to use magic."
Kugrash: But why wouldn't we use a magic bagel?
Rowan: We can use magic all the time.
"Emily: I cast Hellish Rebuke on Don Confetti,"
(fists thudding)
"Don Confetti: Wow, stugots! Bada boom."
Rowan: Do you know—
Kingston: We don't need to beat up every—
"Emily: It was just a bit, it was just a bit."
"Rowan: Who was it that took care of my friend, Sofia's husband?"
Don Confetti: That was Isabella Infierno who did the deed.
Sofia: [softly] Yeah.
Kugrash: Did she kill him?
Don Confetti nods.
Pete: Do you want to know?
"Ally: I like, Mind Link with you privately."
Pete: Do you want to know details?
"Sofia: I'm pretty sure I know the details. I suppose when I saw his spirit it was intact, and so perhaps that gives me the illusion that he had a sort of peaceful, honorable death. I guess if he was put through a garbage disposal I don't wanna know that. I'm gonna take five."
"Pete: Cool, I'll walk with you."
Emily: I walk to the bathroom.
Pete: We can go get coffee or something.
Sofia: Esther you wanna grab that coffee?
"Brennan: Esther nods and says,"
"Esther: That sounds like a good idea, let's do that. It's also very late and you've all been through a knock-down drag-out fight. Maybe we do tomorrow, we'll grab a cuppa Joe and you can rest. We have a bed here if you wanna crash here?"
"Sofia: Yeah do you wanna, like, snuggle and watch Killing Eve on a laptop? It sounds really soothing right now."
Kingston: I've heard about that Killing Eve.
Esther: I wanna be very clear about something. Sandra Oh is the most underappreciated actress of—
Sofia: She's fucking amazing.
"Esther: Why is no one? Oh wait, we're gonna watch Killing Eve, I'm gonna run down to the bodega, I'm gonna grab a pint. What's your favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry's?"
"Sofia: Oh, I thought you were talking alcohol."
"Pete: Ricky loves Killing Eve, weren't you just talking about that?"
"Ricky: I'd love it, I haven't seen it but I love it."
Ally: I look at you like ‘you fucker’.
"Rowan: I gotta say, I don't wanna make a big deal out of this but when Sandra Oh was very young, she did take a workshop with me and she already was incredible."
"Pete: That is so interesting, tell me everything."
"Brennan: Esther looks over, Don Confetti says,"
Don Confetti: It seems like my business here is concluded.
"Brennan: Esther turns and says,"
Esther: Alright.
"Brennan: Lowell Master's address pops up on your phone right away, you have like a little nurse app on there that you can pull up. Emiko sends the records to you. You see that Esther turns and says to you, Kugrash, and goes,"
"Esther: But wait a minute, does Moses have everything he needs? Because the door can't be opened, it's locked without a lock on it. So even with the key there is no lock to put."
Kugrash: What about the—
Rowan: But isn't he trying to—
Kingston: Well the time stone.
Rowan: Create a lock.
Kugrash: The bits and bobbins.
"Brennan: You see that Esther goes,"
"Esther: No, Nod has forbidden a lock to be created."
"Ricky: But what about, sorry go for it."
"Rowan: But if the lock was created on Earth and not in Nod, Nod wouldn't have jurisdiction over it, would they?"
"Esther: To my understanding, they have also barred the entry of a lock into—"
Sofia: But Sinatra's Law?
"Ricky: Yeah, that thing you explained to me."
"Rowan: Yeah, Sinatra's Law, if you can make it here you can make it anywhere."
"Brennan: You see that Esther looks over to you and says,"
Esther: Sinatra's Law?
Ricky: Yes.
"Brennan: You see that she says,"
"Esther: Right, an object..."
"Brennan: She goes and gets the big tome down and she goes.,"
"Esther: “An object that is barred or abjured from being conjured or created in a given locality can be conjured created in that given locality if it is first… [slowly, alarmed] conjured or created within the Five Boroughs of New York.” Sinatra's Law of the Imperial Axiom. If you can make it here..."
Rowan: You can make it anywhere.
Esther: Oh no.
Rowan: So they're going to make it and then bring it to the door.
"Rowan: Or they'll make it here, and then they'll be able to make it in Nod."
Sofia: Yeah.
Brennan: You see that--
"Pete: [to Rowan, breathlessly] You're so smart."
(Brennan laughs)
"Kugrash: We all figured it out, Pete."
"Pete: Ah, God."
Emily: Just so I have a clear visual of this. How tall are you and how tall are you?
Ally: I'm 5’9 pushing 5’10 actually.
Siobhan: I'm like five foot one and a bit.
"Emily: Oh, I thought pixies were like two feet tall."
"Brennan: No, Misty was like 4’10”. And Rowan's like 5’1” 1/2."
"Emily: Okay, cool, cool."
"Siobhan: Pixies are small, faeries are a little bigger."
"Brennan: So you see that Esther says,"
"Esther: [whispering] That's so bad, the Imperial Axiom of course. [normal] Alright, coffee tomorrow. Kingston—"
Kingston: I'm gonna go now.
Esther: Alright.
"Brennan: It's late at night, so rolling up at Lowell's might be a little tricky at this time of night but—"
"Lou: No, I'm going."
"Brennan: You guys head off, cool."
Ally: Is there a way to find out what was in the Big Book of Bits and Bobbins that they need to create this stone? Because maybe that's a process—
Zac: Materials-wise?
"Ally: That they're in the middle of right now. Yeah, maybe there's something."
"Brennan: You see that Esther says,"
Esther: Do you wanna hit the books with me here in the Chantry?
"Pete: Sure, yeah."
"Sofia: Oh I'll hit the books, that sounds good."
"Pete: Yeah? We can just put on Eve in the background. I'm not gonna watch, I'm gonna be working."
Sofia: It'll be a rewatch for me.
Pete: Cool.
Brennan: Esther's gonna give the help action to you; go ahead and make an Arcana check with advantage.
Ally: Cool.
"Seeing Ally’s roll, Murph gasps and covers his mouth with his hand."
Ally: Two nat 1s. What the fuck! That's insane!
"Brennan: That is a one in 400 odds, to roll two nat 1s. On a roll with advantage."
Pete: [to Rowan] You're just so hot now. What?
Brennan: Make a Wild Magic check for me.
Ally: 13.
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: If only we could have kept it going.
Brennan: Incredible.
Emily: Maybe I can step in with my Arcana to help.
"Brennan: No, with two nat 1s nobody can step in with any Arcana."
Ally: Jesus fucking Christ.
Brennan: Esther immediately regrets her decision. Pete tries to do this sorcerer supreme research shit.
Siobhan: The whole point of sorcerers is they don't read books.
Brennan: Incredible. You're also exhausted. Pete you pass out. Esther snuggles up with you and you guys end up watching this.
"Sofia: Hey, girl. [snuggles]"
Zac: I'm just so confused.
"Brennan: What do Rowan, Kugrash and Ricky do?"
"Rowan: I'm knackered, I'm going home."
"Kugrash: Kingston, are you going tonight?"
Kingston: I'm going tonight.
Kugrash: You don't wanna go tomorrow?
Kingston: I don't wanna wait. All of this that's going on--
"Kugrash: Alright I'll go with you, then."
"Brennan: Alright, cool."
Ricky: I guess I'll go too. I feel weird here.
Sofia: You can watch Killing Eve.
"Ricky: It's okay, I'm gonna go with the boys."
"Kingston: Alright, little boys adventure, alright."
Sofia: Are you sure?
Ricky: It's fine.
"Ally: I wake up and go,"
Pete: What the fuck.
Ricky: You're a couple episodes in.
Sofia: Step in!
Ricky: I think—
Sofia: I can walk you through what's happened already. We've got a snuggle going.
"Ricky: Alright, I'll stay."
"Rowan: Fine, I'll go and do the chore. I'll go with you, but I have to say—"
Kugrash: Old people crew. What's up!
"Brennan: So the old people crew, Ricky are you staying?"
Zac: I'm gonna stay.
Emily: He’s snuggling.
"Brennan: On the bed that has Sofia and Esther there, go ahead and make a flat Charisma check."
Ally: To find out which corner of the bed you sit on.
"Zac: That would be 17, wait saving throw or just a check."
Brennan: Just a check.
Zac: Okay then 13.
"Brennan: Cool, you lie down fully hanging off the side of the bed so you're not making body contact at all."
"Zac: I'm like, have one foot on the ground."
Emily: You also can't really see the laptop.
"Zac: But not complaining about it at all, just tolerating it."
"Ally: So uncomfortable but you're like, I am here."
Ricky: At least I'm—
Ally: Am I asleep on the couch somewhere with my cowboy hat on?
"Brennan: Yeah, you're like snoozing over there."
Ricky: What's that character's deal?
Emily: You say that with every new character.
Ricky: What are they doing? Oh that's what they're doing.
"Brennan: Wonderful, wonderful. You guys head all the way uptown. Lowell lives in Washington Heights. Train immediately pulls through the station. You go through the turnstile."
Rowan: Oh wait wait wait. There's a great tamale lady right here that we just have to get a couple for the road!
Kingston: No thank you.
"Rowan: I never come to this neighborhood, [pouty] come on Kingston please."
"Kingston: You are more than welcome to go Miss Berry, I have no interest."
"Rowan: Kingston you're so boring now! Fine, we'll go and do the chore."
"Brennan: You guys arrive in a little apartment building, like six unit, three story apartment building in Washington Heights. As you arrive there you see a little thing on the buzzer that says Masters on it."
Lou: I press it.
Brennan: Pause.
Lowell Masters: Hello?
"Kingston: Hey, Lowell? It's Kingston Brown from the hospital."
"Lowell: Hey, Kingston, can I help you, is everything alright?"
"Kingston: Yeah, the city is in danger, Lowell, and I believe you're one of the few people who can help us."
Lowell: I've been waiting for this moment my whole life.
"Kingston: Alright, buzz us in."
Lowell: Come upstairs.
"Brennan: You guys are buzzed upstairs. You arrive up at the sixth apartment, all the way at the top, little marble stair walkup. It's one of those marble staircases where the marbles actually buckled a little bit, it's been walked on so many times. You get to this door, you knock on it, it opens. The rich smell of spices and incenses and an unmistakable plastic smell of lube wafts out of the apartment. It looks like a wizard's incubation chamber. Every square inch of the apartment is dangling gems and a Balinese demon mask and a tall standing suit of armor and a little pile of gold. It's like the inside of a dragon's hoard if it was all glued to the inside of a little two-bedroom apartment. Lowell opens it, you see he's wearing a blue buttoned-up short- sleeved shirt and some khakis. He looks a little bit wet like he just showered. He goes,"
Lowell: I've been waiting for this day a long time.
"Kingston: Well, I'm glad. These are my friends, Kugrash and—"
Rowan: Rowan.
Kingston: Rowan Berry.
"Rowan: I love your place, so eclectic!"
"Brennan: He looks at you and says,"
"Lowell: My God, I'm sorry it's a little bit messy right now, did I see you in an episode of Law and Order, or am I?"
"Rowan: No, I get that all the time, but no."
"Lowell: You're great, are you, this is a crazy thing to say, are you represented? Because my cousin is a—"
Kugrash: This is happening already?
Kingston: Lowell this is not the same—
"Lowell: I'm sorry, it's crazy."
Rowan: This is not why we're here.
"Lowell: You just got such a look, do you do modeling?"
"Rowan: I've been thinking about it, actually."
Lowell: You should get headshots.
"Rowan: I maybe am too short, but maybe that's a thing."
"Lowell: No, I think—"
"Kingston: Alright. Lowell, how you been, you good?"
Lowell: I'm good. The past month has been the best month of my life and I owe that to you Kingston.
"Kingston: Oh stop, you don't owe me nothing."
"Lowell: Come on in, take a look around."
Brennan: You guys see this place is filled with these incredible artifacts. You see that there's a jade statue of this ancient emperor king. There's all this crazy stuff. There's a box of Spanish doubloons with a gilded dagger on the top of it. All this wild shit is here.
Lou: Can I turn around real quick to these two?
"Kingston: [quietly] Don't touch nothing, it's probably been in his ass."
Lou: And then turn back around.
"Lowell: So, what can I do for you?"
Lou: Have I removed an eagle or a bird from his asshole?
Brennan: You have removed a bird from his ass.
"Kingston: Okay, great. Hey Lowell, on one of your appointments I believe there was like a bird that needed to be taken care of. Do you still have that bird?"
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"Lowell: The bird, oh the bronze eagle I found?"
"Kingston: Yes, I believe so."
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
Lowell: You just want anything to drink or anything while we're here?
Kingston: Earl Grey Tea.
"Brennan: You see he goes and makes some tea. Comes over and goes,"
"Lowell: Bronze eagle, take a seat. (groans in pain)"
Rowan: What's in your butt?
Lowell: (breathing out harshly) I'm good.
Rowan: No.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Lowell: I've found a very old granite pentacle moss-covered, the circle is not part of it, so it's just a five-pointed star."
Rowan: [clearly uncomfortable] So the texture of granite and moss and it's a pointed star?
Lowell: I've developed quite a thick interior hide.
Kugrash: So you showered before all this?
Lowell: You think I'm gonna put an incredibly potent religious relic in my asshole without being cleaned up first?
"Kugrash: Sort of a, shower in the beginning, shower at the end sort of thing."
Rowan: You're right that is the respectful—
"Kingston: Anyway, it's good to hear—"
"Brennan: You see he looks and takes out a little notebook and seems to write some notes in it, puts it down and says,"
"Lowell: I know about the eagle, the Sardinian Eagle."
Kingston: Yeah.
Lowell: When you gave me that talk I actually discovered that I'm more magical than I originally thought. I have the power to basically identify these magical objects.
Kugrash: Could you stick this crown up your ass?
Murph: I take my rat crown out.
"Brennan: Spiky fucking crown. He takes it and says,"
"Lowell: Yeah, I'll need about a day and a half."
"Kingston: Also, wait, real quick. What is that?"
Lowell: Hmm?
"Kingston: This man, what is this man?"
"Lowell: He's a rat, he's a rat man."
Kingston: Oh you see this rat man.
"Lowell: After you gave me that talk, because I was finding these weird artifacts and I was seeing things out of the corner of my eye and stuff like that, but yeah."
Kingston: So you have the ability to cast the Identify spell with your rectum?
"Lowell: It's about the size and shape of it, yeah."
"Rowan: I actually don't want to think about size or shape, when we're talking about—"
"Lowell: The important thing is this, I already sold the Sardinian Eagle."
Rowan: No.
Kugrash: To who?
Lowell: I sold it to a collector.
"Brennan: You see he, hold on one second."
Murph: [defeated] I think I know who he sold it to.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Kingston: You're killing me Lowell, you're killing me."
Brennan: You see he goes—
Ally: Share.
"Brennan: He says,"
Lowell: I sold it to an elemental named Buddy.
Rowan: Oh.
Kingston: No.
Zac: The shit guy!
Kingston: No you didn't. Okay Lowell.
Ally: Which guy?
Siobhan: Buddy Buddy.
(Ally gasps)
Brennan: Make a History check for me.
Lou: Nat 20.
Ally: Wow.
Siobhan: Nice.
Brennan: You have a text on your phone from Willy about the card game tomorrow night. He sent you a list of who all's gonna be there. Buddy is gonna be at that card game.
"Kingston: Alright, fantastic. Well I know where to find Buddy. But Lowell, it's good to see you doing well man and really nice place, it was good to drop by, good to see you."
"Lowell: Good to see you too, my life is turned around and you're a decent man. Enjoy the tea, take a look at any of the wonders. Ooh let me show you this."
"Brennan: You see he reaches up onto his shelf and takes a full Russian Czar's minx coat and says,"
"Lowell: This is actually something very interesting, maybe for you Kugrash. Do you wanna go ahead,"
Brennan: And you see he hands it out for you to handle.
Kugrash: Yeah.
Lowell: That took a long time. That was a while.
Rowan: Sleeve by sleeve.
"Brennan: But he said,"
"Lowell: But you probably don't get that cold, even though you sleep in the sewers. It's not that magical I just thought you might want a warm coat."
"Kugrash: Yeah, yeah, sure thanks, appreciate it."
Murph: Just put on this ass jacket.
"Kugrash: What do you think, Kingston?"
Kingston: I mean—
Kugrash: Hey guys!
Murph: I'm like coming over.
Rowan: I think it's cool.
Kingston: Get off of me!
Rowan: You smell better now honestly.
"Brennan: He says,"
"Lowell: Can we not be children, everything gets washed."
"Kingston: Yeah, of course it does."
Kugrash: I smell like lube now instead of trash.
"Kingston: I think in that way, it is an upgrade."
Brennan: Wonderful. So you know where Buddy's gonna be.
"Kugrash: I think I'm actually gonna need that crown, so I'll keep it for now but we'll link up at some point."
"Lowell: Hey, got your back, Kugrash."
Kugrash: Appreciate it.
"Lowell: You guys, thanks for coming by, have a great one. [moans] Oh no, oh no, no, no, we're good. [stands up]"
"Brennan: You see that you guys head out. The next day, you guys wake up in your various places, some belated gifts with a little note on them that says, sorry I couldn't get it in time for Christmas, arrive to some of you guys. Kugrash, your apartment with Wally, you find a lovely little watch, a fucking dope Rolex."
Brennan hands Murph a spell card.
Murph: Whoa.
"Brennan: Which you haven't had since your businessman days, appears in a little Christmas gift for you."
Murph: Hell yeah.
"Ally: Hey, ah that's sick."
"Brennan: Kingston, we already know what your gifts were. Rowan, you actually probably have to crash somewhere else that night because Rowan doesn't have the thing, but you swing by your lawyer’s office the next day, deal with all of your inheritance, and you arrive at a freshly cleaned and wonderful penthouse and a little Christmas gift is waiting for you."
Brennan hands Siobhan an item card.
Rowan: You know Long Island City is the new place to be living.
Brennan: It has a Tiffany's wrapping on it and you feel it has a similar arcane energy to Titania's shoes on it. This beautiful silver necklace.
Siobhan: Do I still get Irresistible Dance?
Brennan: You do not get Irresistible Dance with it.
"Siobhan: Begone Irresistible Dance, I resist you."
"Brennan: Ricky, you wake up at your home and see a giant bow on top and Ox in the passenger seat of a fire engine red Maserati."
Emily: Oh hell yeah!
Siobhan: Oh my god. Jesus Christ.
Emily: Why was I even trying to help you get laid? You’ve got it under control!
Siobhan: Because Esther's definitely gonna be impressed by a car.
Ally: The suicide doors open up.
"Brennan: You see Ox goes,"
"Ox: Woof, woof, wow, what a cool car!"
Ricky: This is dope as hell.
"Brennan: And Sofia, you wake up in the chantry, and next to you all packaged up, are a pair of red Louboutins."
"Sofia: Oh my God, are they real?"
Emily: I bite it.
Ally: [laughing] You bite it?
"Brennan: Bite it like an old fucking prospector. Cool. So the next day's happening. You know where you're gonna see Buddy. So that day, let's just go around real quick and see what y'all do that day. Sofia, you wake up in the chantry. These awesome red Louboutins and—"
"Emily: I think, oh."
"Brennan: Oh yeah, what are you gonna do?"
"Emily: Well, I was thinking maybe I would just do some Krav Maga. Just keep fresh."
[song that sounds suspiciously like the Rocky theme]
"Brennan: Yeah, there's plenty of room, there's some dojo spaces within the chantry for the wizards to practice. You practice for a while. Your Louboutins allow you to spring huge distances, incredible distances. After a little while you see that Esther walks in."
Sofia: You wanna spar?
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Esther: Sure, I'll spar a little bit."
Brennan: Go ahead and just give me an Athletics check. You gotta beat a 20.
"Emily: I did, 23."
"Brennan: You see that Esther is pretty cool as a martial wizard caster. She takes out her bat, blocks some of your stuff with the bat and does a lot of stuff to throw obstacles and wards, she's very good at putting these Tenser’s Floating Disk shields around."
Emily: This is like the perfect sparring partner for me.
"Brennan: It's awesome. Esther's like,"
"Esther: I can't believe that it's taken us this long to hang out, It's been a crazy month but."
"Sofia: I know, well honestly I was kinda going through something and then I came toward some sort of closure and it just feels, when you were nice to me in that fight it just felt really nice to feel like someone wanted to be my friend and that meant a lot."
"Brennan: You see that she smiles and says,"
Esther: This is a hard city and I don't think you can get through without having some pals. Wanna get that coffee?
Sofia: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. You guys head out to go get that coffee. Kugrash, we're actually gonna cut over to you real quick. What do you do, you wake in Wally's that next day, Dad is there. [barking]"
Murph: Dad the dog. The game is tonight right?
Brennan: Yes.
Murph: The poker game? Okay. I wanna have a little talk with Wally around the breakfast table. What do we have for breakfast? Cheese?
Brennan: String cheese and hotdogs.
Murph: String cheese (laughs) so their breakfast is string cheese and hotdogs.
"Kugrash: Hey Wally, so before you and I started hanging out, who were you hanging out with around here?"
Wally: My friends at work.
"Kugrash: Your friends at work, cool. Generally, kinda happy guy? How are you holding up Wally, do you ever get lonely out here or?"
"Wally: Yeah, I guess sometimes. You know it's hard. It's hard to meet people sometimes too, I work for the MTA and I tried to make one of those OkCupids?"
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Wally: But it's hard, because it's hard to meet people sometimes and I got like a busy schedule and stuff. And I ask David for help with it, but me and David don't get along sometimes."
Kugrash: Why don't you and David get along?
"Brennan: You see that he looks at his phone and says,"
"Wally: He's actually on the way over today, he yells at me a lot, he worries about me because I live by myself, and... he worries because he thinks I shouldn't have two dogs because he thinks I'm not gonna be able to take care of them both."
"Kugrash: But you have a job, you can do it, you can."
"Wally: No, I know, I think he just thinks I'm a little dumb."
"Kugrash: Oh, you're not dumb, Wally."
Wally: Thanks.
"Kugrash: Yeah, you're a good guy. Do you want to, this OkCupid stuffs confusing, I've heard a little bit about it, I haven't really used a computer since the '80s but maybe you and I can figure it out together."
"Wally: Yeah, you wanna do that?"
"Kugrash: Yeah, let's figure it out, I don't know what the fuck’s going on either."
"Brennan: He pops the laptop open, give me a flat Charisma check to try and help him make an OkCupid profile."
Murph groans nervously.
"Murph: I'd like to really focus on non-flashy stuff, he has a job, he's a good guy. [rolls] Uh… 11?"
"Brennan: Cool, so he says,"
"Wally: Okay job, work for the MTA. Interests. [sighs]"
Kugrash: You like movies.
"Wally: Die Hard, Die Hard 2, Die Hard 3."
"Kugrash: We don't have to get that into it, why don't you say you like action movies."
Wally: Action movies.
Kugrash: Movies in general.
Wally: Movies in general.
"Kugrash: Maybe delete movies in general, get rid of movies in general. We like the Lion King."
"Wally: The Lion King! Hobbies, Mufasa, Simba."
"Kugrash: Wally, those aren't hobbies, those are characters."
"Wally: No, because they're like hobby."
Kugrash: Discussing films.
"Wally: Disgusting films, I don't like them. I only like it when it's nice."
"Kugrash: Wally, let me type. Discussing films."
"Wally: Oh, put down falling in love with a lady."
"Kugrash: Falling in love with a lady. Looking for something serious, let's put that in the appropriate section."
"Wally: What like, serious, like not funny? I like jokes."
Kugrash: I know you like jokes.
Wally: Put joke books.
Kugrash: You know how David has a serious relationship?
"Wally: Yeah, he's not fun at all."
Kugrash: He's not fun at all.
"Murph: I start laughing hysterically,"
"Kugrash: David's a fucking ball buster, he should be, I ruined his life, but."
Brennan: You hear a bang bang bang on the door as you say that.
Murph: Oh God.
"Brennan: You see Wally gets up and opens the door. David comes in. David has an immediate haggard look, he goes,"
"David: Hey Wally, how's it going, got you some bagels and some food and I got you some cleaning stuff and paper towels."
"Brennan: Wally says,"
"Wally: Oh yeah, I forgot to get that stuff."
Brennan: Are you Wild Shaped right now or no?
[tense music]
"Murph: Oh God, he's probably gonna like think I'm a giant rat and try to kill me if I don't say something. Yes, I'll Wild Shape into a dog."
Brennan: Roll initiative for me.
Murph: 13.
"Brennan: David spots you before you can change. He goes,"
"David: Oh, Jesus Christ, Wally, what the fuck! You got a fucking rat in the middle of your fucking house!"
Kugrash: He doesn't have a rat.
Murph: I cast Dispel Magic on myself to try to break the—
"Brennan: Umbral Arcana. Yeah, I'm gonna say third level or lower. You appear to David. He goes,"
(panicked screaming)
"Kugrash: David, it's okay."
"David takes several quick, panicked breaths."
"Kugrash: Okay, this is a lot to unpack here. But I'm sorta a shaman type deal. I can do magic, let me just, magic is real."
"Murph: Do like a couple of cantrips, just right off the bat."
"Kugrash: I'm not a rat. I am your father. I didn't run away. I was cursed by a witch. Who turned me into a rat. You know I'm a rat, you're a ball buster, you can kinda believe that right. Magic is real,"
Murph: I show him like my—
"Brennan: You see Wally goes,"
"Wally: Also I don't have two dogs. One of my dogs was Dad who's a rat, and he's not Jesus."
"Brennan: David goes catatonic, he passes out. As he comes to he's in a fugue state."
"[dreamlike, soft music]"
"Murph: I have the Bagel of All Things, it kinda lets me do divination. I wanna try to help give him some kind of connection to this other world. I wanna just pop off a couple of poppy seeds in his mouth while he's knocked out."
"Brennan: He takes it, his pupils dilate so much that they disappear and he only has irises. So his hazel eyes have no pupil, he's just gazing straight ahead, whole universes are appearing to him. Wally goes,"
Wally: That's a good bagel.
"Brennan: After a few minutes, you can start king of like, pick up explaining and he needs you to repeat things over and over again."
"Murph: Right. I think I also bring up, I know some real people saw the bugs thing so if there's any conspiracy websites or something I'm like, here's proof that it exists."
"Brennan: After a while, he's got like a blanket around him, he goes,"
"David: Okay. So you lied, you lied, because you did run away."
"Kugrash: I did, yes. I did it, I know you think I ran away to a tropical island and that my life ruled or something but I'm a rat and my life sucked until very recently when I moved in with Wally here."
"Brennan: You see Wally goes,"
"Wally: Yeah, it's better now he's with me."
"Brennan: You see David goes,"
"David: Shut the fuck up, Wally. So what is it you've been doing for the past 20 years, 30 years?"
"Kugrash: Well, for the first few years I pretty much just hid out in the subway tunnels feeling sorry for myself and blaming the person who cursed me. But after a while it gave me some perspective and in the end I wish had been the type of person who was naturally empathetic but I had to have something bad happen to me before I could learn to help other people."
David: And are you still helping other people?
"Kugrash: I'm trying to, yeah."
"Brennan: Here's a question for you Murph, has Kugrash been tending to his duties with the homeless since he's been with Wally?"
Murph: Probably less so.
"Brennan: Probably less so, cool. I think that you have a very high Wisdom, I think it probably occurs to Kugrash that that is the truth. You see that David looks and goes,"
"David: Alright, okay, magic's real, everything I know's wrong."
"Kugrash: David, do you know Robert Moses?"
"David: Yeah, power broker? Yeah I know him."
"Kugrash: Yeah I'm actually going after him at the moment, because part of the bad side of all this magic is being controlled by him."
David: So you're asking me for a favor.
"Kugrash: I would like to help you if I can. Honestly David, the reason I came to Wally first is because I think Wally needs me, Wally likes having me around. But if you want me around, I'd like to have a relationship with you but I don't wanna be selfish about it, don't do it for me. But I'd like to, I don't want a favor from you I wanna work with you."
"Brennan: He looks at you and says,"
"David: If Wally needs you, he can have you."
"Kugrash: Alright, you don't have to forgive me but I am very sorry."
"David: I don't have to forgive you? I don't have to forgive you. Well it's nice to hear, that's nice to hear. There was a time in my life when I needed you. That time's gone, and for you to waltz back into my life now? As a rat wearing a cape? I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. I don't think that you'd be talking to me or Wally if it didn't help you. Have a nice rest of your life, you fucking rat."
"Brennan: And you see David walks out of the apartment. Wally's just crying. He looks over and says,"
"Wally: David's a J-E-R-K sometimes. I'm sorry, Dad."
"Kugrash: You spelled it correctly, J-E-R-K you said?"
Wally: Yeah.
Kugrash: That's good.
Wally: He's a real jork.
"Kugrash: You got it wrong in a different way than I thought you might. No he's not. Look Wally, you're just exceptionally, you're doing me a favor that you don't need to do and David is within his rights to be mad and that's okay for him too."
"Brennan: Wally nods, yeah I think, Kugrash you actually feel that it has been like Christmas and there's probably some homeless and people that need tending to out in the world. Wally says,"
"Wally: I'm gonna talk to David. It's probably a lot for him, I have a hard time understanding everything right when someone tells me and probably David's the same way."
"Kugrash: Yeah, cool. Wally you go talk to your brother, I got some things I gotta do."
"Brennan: Kugrash you go hit the cold streets, tending to people that need food and care. Going back to your duties as a caretaker of the dispossessed. Sofia, you and Esther get together in a little coffee shop. It's lovely. You see that Em shows up outside and waves. Huge statue angel comes in and goes,"
"Em: [sighs] Oh my god, I'm happy to chip in, I gotta pay in quarters and pennies and things that people throw in the fountain."
Sofia: That's so off-putting. Let me just get this.
"Brennan: So you see Esther sits down with you and goes,"
"Esther: Yeah, Sof, thank you so much for suggesting this. It feels nice to have someone that's just a friend, someone that's not gonna be talking to me about Arcana and wizardry and yada yada yada. Nice to have someone just to bond with as a pal."
Sofia: Yeah.
Esther: How are you holding up?
"Brennan: And you see that she just very tenderly reaches out and puts a hand on your arm, as like you're going through a lotta stuff."
"Emily: Yeah, think I'm blushing."
"Sofia: Sorry, Ricky, she touched me!"
Zac: I'm not here.
"Sofia: I'm holding up. I mourned him leaving me, now I'm mourning his death. I don't know, I guess maybe at least now it feels like more closure. And I burned my house down."
Esther: You are fucking wild.
Sofia: What can I say? And honestly it kinda felt good to get rid of that. And just close the door and I don't even know what my fucking future is but it's whatever right now.
"Brennan: Esther's eyes goes wide and she says,"
"Esther: Yeah, the future is whatever."
Brennan: Make an Insight—
"Sofia: Why, what's going on with, oh."
"Brennan: Yeah, make a little Insight check."
Emily: 15.
"Brennan: You see her eyes kinda go wide as she looks out and she says,"
"Esther: Yeah, what do you think about Ricky?"
"Sofia: Oh. [clears throat, suddenly speaking very loudly] I think he's just the greatest guy ever, any girl will be so lucky to have him."
"Brennan: You see Em goes,"
"Em: Oh my god, you're like looking out like you're performing for a packed theater."
"Sofia: No, I'm not! I'm doing a good job."
"Brennan: You see that Esther laughs and goes,"
Esther: I… I took Ricky to see my mom and grandma at the holiday.
Sofia: [with distaste] Family on the holidays.
"Brennan: Em says,"
"Em: You're not even dating, this feels fast to me, family and Christmas."
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"[somber, gentle music]"
"Esther: No, not like that. I am... My family's been cursed for most of the history of New York. I am meant to become the third of the furies of Tompkins Square Park. We, not we, not me, I’m... I found Alejandro because I wanted to study magic to find a way to break this curse and the truth is that I don't need to study magic, I am magic, but the part of me that is an alien magic I've never tapped into because once I do, I can't go back."
Sofia: Oh my God. But if we could remove this curse then you would have access to a whole wealth of no longer cursed energy.
Esther: Yeah.
Sofia: Who cursed your family?
"Esther: Powerful spirits a long time ago. Back early 1800s. It goes in order, my mother is the current Fury of Rage, my grandmother is the Fury of Despair, and my mother—"
"Brennan: Kugrash, you're walking down the street and going from garbage to garbage and finding people. You come outside of this coffee shop and overhear this conversation happening. You see she says,"
"Esther: We change into the Furies if we ever experience our emotion powerfully enough. My mum wanted a better life for us and she tried to leave the Unsleeping City. She swore off magic. She entered the Waking World. She became a businesswoman and she started a financial company, basically a hedge fund with this rat bastard piece of shit who sold her out and destroyed their company to profit himself and it ruined her and she fell to her curse. She reached in for that magic and I lost her."
Murph is looking down at the table.
Brennan: And you see she looks like she's about to cry and then quickly a little cantrip ticks on herself and she [little gasp] gets it back.
Emily: I reciprocate the tender touch.
"Brennan: She's like,"
"Esther: Oof, I think I need to be more careful talking about this because of my curse."
Sofia: Would you say that's why romantically you have to hold yourself back?
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Esther: My curse is sorrow and sadness, psychologically speaking, is the experience of loss. And so I've studied magic to find a way to break the curse and I've lived my life under the presupposition that you can never feel sadness if you never have anything to lose."
"Sofia: I'm honestly not the girl to be talking about this right now because I am currently trying to follow your path a bit, if I'm being honest. But we're gonna find a way to get rid of that curse."
Brennan: You see she smiles and says—
"Sofia: You've got Sofie, you got Sofie Bikes, aka Sofia Lee, no longer Sofie Bikes, I have disowned my family, Sofie Lee on the case."
"Brennan: You see that she smiles and says,"
"Esther: Well shit, that's been my hold up this whole time, now it's all engines go."
"Brennan: She smiles, she says,"
"Esther: Cool, well if we keep talking about this sad shit I'm gonna turn into a literal monster, so let's not."
Brennan: You and Em and Esther have a lovely time and Kugrash you hear all that out in the street.
Murph: I just go to sleep in the trash.
"Brennan: Cool. Kingston, it's card night over at Willy's."
Kingston: Oh finally.
"Brennan: Obviously you guys have been hanging out for weeks and days and stuff, who all would show up to the card game."
Ally: I would definitely. I would definitely be a gambling—
Emily: I feel like I definitely would.
"Brennan: Sofie, hell yeah. Sofie, Pete, Kingston, cool."
"Emily: I know it's gonna come down to rolls, but I feel like Sofie would be really good at cards."
Zac: I think Ricky will go just to see what a card game is like.
Emily: Ricky will be--
"Siobhan: Rowan's definitely going,"
"Rowan: Strip poker. We mean strip poker, right."
Pete: What? No! What?
"Brennan: So you guys go over, Willy being made of brick actually has a very nice apartment—"
"Murph: Can I actually, I have a spell called Conjure Elemental that I really want to use but it's a casting time one minute can I bring a plus one elemental too because I can't do it in—"
Brennan: What kind of elemental would you like to bring?
"Kugrash: Oh man, I guess. Kingston what do you think would be most appropriate?"
"Kingston: Like for Willy's place? I don't know, something earth maybe, something stone, cement, that's kind of his vibe so."
Murph: I find some dirt and rocks.
[scratchy folk music]
"Brennan: Cool, you create a big earth elemental out of stones and earth from one of those tree planter places. You guys head to Willy's in Brook, opens up, he's got some very old phonograph playing, got some great jazz, little of like klezmer notes in there. You see he goes,"
Willy: Kingston Brown finally we see what the game can—
Kingston: I know it's been a while and I've brought all my friends.
"Brennan: Oh you see he goes,"
"Willy: Oh, come in, we've set up two tables."
Kingston: Right.
"Siobhan: I bring in two six packs of PBR because when in Williamburg, that's what you drink."
"Brennan: Exactly, you bring some PBR. You see Willy has like snacks laid out. It's like got a very old world, there's like cigars and ashtrays and chips on the felt tables."
"Sofia: Ricky, did you just bring boiled chicken in a Tupperware?"
"Ricky: It's a party, right?"
"Pete: Gross, man."
Sofia: So healthy.
"Brennan: Willy sets up some tables and says,"
Willy: You gonna take all of our money again?
"Kingston: Okay, alright, well let's not start from that place alright? Everybody can win no?"
"Brennan: You see that he says,"
"Willy: Go on, take a seat."
"Brennan: He looks over at the earth elemental that you've brought and goes,"
"Willy: Well, hello, hello, hello there. Oh my name is Willy. Pleasure to meet you, enchanté. [kisses hand]"
Brennan: The elemental kind of like. (groaning)
"Lou: Can I give him just a hard elbow, like I actually need to put force into."
"Brennan: So you go boom, brick into his body and you see he goes,"
"Willy: What, do you see what I see?"
"Kingston: Okay, I thought you were about the Statue of Liberty."
"Willy: Oh listen, that's on a back burner, I'm playing the long game. [steeples his fingers and winks]"
"Kingston: Oh the long, alright Willy."
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"Willy: This woman, she's something else."
"Brennan: You see that, you guys sit around. At the table there's a couple of people here, you see Buddy the shit elemental is there, he sits next to you Kugrash."
"Buddy: [burbling] I'm needing a lawyer, I don't know about you."
"Kugrash: Yeah, I'm sorry, I was tied up."
Buddy: No worries.
"Brennan: You see Willy says,"
"Willy: Okay, we start to play. Anyone at any time can feel free, here's the Febreeze, you can just hit Buddy with that if the smell gets too much."
"Brennan: There's other people here. You see that there's a stained glass saint from a church. Looks like he's jumped out of a window just going,"
"Glass Saint: Fucking, I can't get anymore into the house I've lost so much fucking money here."
"Brennan: And you see that also, they're at a nearby table, Willy says,"
Willy: You remember Green and Red right?
"Brennan: And you see there is a little green stick figure made of light and a red hand both sitting in a chair. And you see they both go,"
"Green and Red: Hi, how's you, Kingston good to see you."
"Kingston: Good to see you, Green, good to see you, Red."
"Brennan: You see that Green looks up and says,"
"Green: By the way, we're not doing tournament style tonight because I actually have to head out a little bit early."
"Brennan: You see the hand says,"
"Red: You're leaving early? What the fuck, I thought we were staying, can you not stay for longer?"
"Brennan: And you see that Green goes,"
"Green: I've gotta jet, I'm sorry I've gotta be somewhere."
Brennan: You see that—
Ally: Brennan. (laughs)
Brennan: You see that (laughs) you gotta forgive me.
Ally: [shaking their head] I love it. I love it.
"Brennan: Cool. You guys start to play some hands of poker. Go ahead everyone and just make a, I'm gonna say this as just a flat Intelligence check."
Zac: Oh no.
Siobhan: Oh no. Oh dear.
Emily: I got a 4.
"Brennan: A 4, cool."
Siobhan: I got a nat 1.
Ally: 3.
Lou: 6.
Brennan: 6.
Murph: Fucking 6.
Zac: 9.
"Lou: Wow, we're getting taken."
Brennan: You guys are getting--
Lou: Ricky.
Zac: Is this worth using a luck point?
Siobhan: Can I—
Murph: Let's wait till the stakes are up.
Siobhan: Do some real fun card tricks though while we're playing and I’m having all of my money stolen.
"Brennan: Yes, you do some very fun, you're great at dealing. Willy is cleaning up. You see Willy has this big cigar and you see it has to work really hard. He vents the cigar smoke out of swiveling bricks out the side of his chest. He goes,"
Willy: You see poker is not only a game of chance it's a game of skill. You're playing the predator not the cards.
Pete: True.
Brennan: Buddy is looking hurt. He coughs a bunch of shit covered coins up onto the table. You see that Willy polishes and cleans them off to put them into the center pot. Another hand comes around. Are any of you going to use any magic or abilities on this card game?
Siobhan: I will absolutely do Deception-based Performance checks since we're playing poker.
"Brennan: Yeah, you can go ahead and make a bluff check go ahead and give me a Deception roll on the next one."
Kingston: Can I cast Enhance Abilities on myself (magical chiming) to give myself advantage on Intelligence checks?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Murph: I'm going to, I know Kugrash doesn't have the best luck and Ricky's a lot luckier so I'm like,"
"Kugrash: Ah I'm out, I'm gonna go sit with the kid."
"Murph: And I put my hand on Ricky's shoulder and I cast Guidance, a cantrip."
Siobhan: I'm just gonna also cast Minor Illusion to make my breasts slightly bigger.
Murph: So you can roll a d4 and add it to—
Pete: So stupid.
Murph: An ability check.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: Green looks over and you as you do that and quickly looks away. And you see that Red turns over and goes,"
"Red: [whispering judgmentally] Wow, really, okay."
Kingston: Things look really bad between them but I don't have the heart to say anything. It's like really bad and we can all see it but it's like we're friends with both of them so I don't know which one I can talk to.
Ally: I'm just gonna play this straight up because I have a ton of money from selling a lot of my cocaine to children today. It was a rough day.
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: Can I cast Unseen Servant and have them go round and write down what other people have?
"Brennan: Yes, you can. Go ahead and give me your guys’ rolls."
Zac: Just one more roll?
Brennan: One more roll.
Ally: 4.
Emily: 7.
"Siobhan: Oh my god, on advantage I rolled a 1 and a 3."
Lou: 21.
"Zac: I rolled a 12, maybe I'll just use a luck point on this, it just—"
Brennan: Yeah go for it.
Siobhan: Go for it.
Ally: Don't you get something with Guidance?
"Murph: Yeah he got a d4, he added it."
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and roll."
"Zac: That's a 20, not nat."
"Brennan: Ricky, you go in and clear a bunch of people out of the round early on before the flop."
Zac: I have huge sunglasses on.
"Pete: Where did you get those, dude?"
Ricky: Found them.
"Brennan: Kingston, it ends up just you and Buddy before the river. Buddy's still in and you're still in. You have a bigger stack than Buddy right now. Buddy goes,"
Buddy: [fart burble] All in.
"Kingston: Now Buddy buddy, that won't do. You're gonna have to match all of this."
Lou: I push mine in.
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Buddy: Oh, it's gonna be like that is it?"
"Kingston: Yeah, hey you're the one who called."
"Brennan: You see he goes, looks around, see sweats of little weird poop oil."
"Emily and Ally: Eugh, no."
Kingston: Buddy I know that you're a collector aren't you?
"Buddy: Yeah, a collector."
"Kingston: Okay, why don't you put one of those on the table?"
Brennan: Go ahead and make a Persuasion check.
"Lou: Great, Persuasion, there it is and I have advantage on these, thank God. That's gonna be 6 plus 7, so 13."
"Brennan: 13\. You see he goes, (imitating puking) and a bronze eagle thumps into the table."
"Kingston: Now that feels right, doesn't it? Doesn't that feel right?"
Pete: Do you even want that man? It looks like shit.
Brennan: You see he says—
"Kingston: Come on! Come on, Pete!"
"Pete: This thing is a piece of shit, you're a collector right?"
"Buddy: Oh, I am a piece of shit."
Siobhan: Can I do an Insight check on Buddy to see if he's playing straight?
"Brennan: Yeah, make an Insight check."
Emily: I also wanna send my Unseen Servant to spy on Buddy's hand.
Siobhan: 16.
"Brennan: 16\. Oh, 16, you think he's playing straight. He coughs the eagle up. Kingston, what kind of cards do you think Kingston's holding?"
"Lou: Pretty good but not like a definite, it's like you know."
"Brennan: So you throw down a ten-king, suited of hearts. You see that Buddy throws down pocket aces and there's already an ace on the board. He goes,"
Buddy: Looks like some bad luck.
Brennan: You see Willy turns over the last card and it comes up jack of hearts.
"Kingston: Oh I'm sorry Buddy, I'm so sorry."
"Buddy: No, [burbles grossly] you're kidding me!"
"Kingston: You know you've been having a rough month, and I hate to do it to you but that's the game Buddy. That's the game Buddy. Now somebody give me a damn hose so I can clean this eagle off."
Brennan: You see that Willy laughs and claps. He gives you a cigar and lights it for you.
"Kingston: Alright now, you know I can't be smoking this. Come on."
Brennan: He goes—
Rowan: I'll smoke it.
Brennan: Wonderful. You've got your bronze eagle.
Pete: Wanna share it? [Rowan passes the cigar to Pete]
"Brennan: Great. You clean out at the poker game. Esther grabs the eagle from you after the poker game and says,"
"Esther: Great. I'm gonna get to work on this right now, this should be able to find Moses for us. Well, you should be able to get Robert."
"Pete: Oh, right, now I get it."
"Kingston: Damn, Pete."
Pete: It was ugly as fuck.
Kingston: Okay.
"Pete: It was like a gaudy eagle statue, I was shocked."
"Brennan: It is the morning, Esther goes to work on getting the eagle functional. It is the morning of December 31st. You—"
Siobhan: 9 a.m.
Ally: I'm making deliveries all day.
"Brennan: Okay. Just fucking hustling. So you guys are all, you're probably like with Jackson and doing stuff and Esther also comes and checks out the monastery as well."
"Sofia: Oh sweet, do you wanna go get our New Year's Eve dresses after?"
"Brennan: You see she nods and says,"
Esther: That'd be great.
Sofia: Or pantsuits.
"Esther: I don't necessarily, yeah, I'm more of a pants person, I don't really rock a dress."
"Sofia: I'm honestly these days, yeah me too, let's get pantsuits."
"Brennan: You see that, Pete you're making deliveries. Kugrash what are you getting up to on New Year’s?"
"Murph: What am I doing on New Years? Seeing Wally, Wally what are you doing?"
"Brennan: Wally's working, he's working at the MTA. He says he can take you round the trains and show you his job."
"Murph: Yeah, follow Wally around."
Ally: Cute.
"Brennan: Rowan, Alissa shows up New Year's Day and says,"
"Alissa: Hi, [wipes a tear] are you Miss Berry?"
"Rowan: I am, you must be Alissa."
"Alissa: I am, I'm just here to drop off some stuff from the late Miss Moore."
"Rowan: Oh that's so nice of you. Do you think you could go to the DMV for me, is that how that works?"
"Brennan: You see she looks and says,"
"Alissa: Well, I—"
"Rowan: As a last favor, I'm sure Misty would have wanted that."
"Brennan: You see that she looks and says,"
"Alissa: Sure, I'm unemployed at the moment so I have time."
"Rowan: Oh, great. Oh, I mean oh no. Wow."
Ally: She's such a bad fucking person.
Brennan: You've got a bunch of fucking cartel cocaine in your bag.
Zac: You're selling drugs to children.
Ally: I'm selling drugs to literal children and still you are a bad person and I should not like you.
"Brennan: Incredible. Yeah, she agrees to go run to the DMV for you."
"Rowan: Oh and before you go, who was it that told you to put the mirror on the stage?"
"Alissa: One of the benefactors of the theater, it was from the Robert Moses foundation."
"Rowan: Of course it was, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Alissa I can offer you a job, but just so you know if anything like that ever happens again."
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Alissa: Oh, I learned my mistake it will never happen—"
Rowan: Never again.
Pete: Aren't you younger now than Alissa? “I can offer you a job.”
Rowan: Money's money.
"Brennan: Ricky, what are you getting up to."
Ally: You're a nightmare.
Zac: It's 31st. I guess Ricky's at the fire station just—
"Brennan: Doing his thing. You see the questing blade says,"
"Questing Blade: Sire, this new Maserati is extremely dope. What swagger in this vehicle."
Ricky: [holding his axe like a phone] What's wagger in the vehicle?
"Questing Blade: No I'm saying, what swagger as in remarking upon the swagger."
"Ricky: Oh yes, it is full of swagger. I feel honestly terrible for driving it."
"Brennan: Kingston, that morning Claude actually asks if you can take your niece and nephews. They have a project over the holiday, he's working but they need to do a report on the Met and so they need to go to the Met and be shown around basically."
"Kingston: Yeah, let's do it"
"Brennan: You go to the Met you're walking around, the nieces and nephews are having a ball. You see that your niece looks up, Eliza, and she goes,"
"Eliza: Uncle Kingston, we had such a fun time over Christmas. Pete, how long is Pete gonna be staying with you?"
"Kingston: Well Pete's in between, I guess, places in his life right now, which is something that adults do and so until he figures himself out he'll probably be crashing with me."
"Brennan: Nods, you see that Jamil and Cooper both go,"
"Jamil and Cooper: Oh, look at this!"
Brennan: And they run off towards the Temple of Dendur.
"Kingston: Okay, no running, no running, especially towards that thing."
"Brennan: You look and you see there's a bunch of kids and families in here. You're kinda looking around, this is where you had your climatic battle all those years ago, where the mummy of the Met said those words so long ago. You hear a voice next to you go,"
[tense string music]
"Robert: I— uh, I love places like this, where you see a little bit of old history."
"Brennan: And you see Robert standing beside you as your niece and nephews run around, he goes,"
"Robert: Good looking kids. [beat] Not yours of course. But, you know what I mean."
"Kingston: What do you want, Mr. Moses?"
"Robert: Well, I thought I'd take in the museum here on this special occasion. Vox Populi, that’s a rough gig."
"Kingston: I said, what do you want, Mr Moses?"
"Brennan: You see he says,"
Robert: I'd thought I'd come talk to you because you're the reasonable one of your companions.
"Kingston: Fine, then speak on it."
"Robert: Things are gonna change in this place. This city's gonna change. I know that you are gonna go down with the ship. I know that about you. You love these people, the Populi of which you are the Vox but there's a version of New York without them. 150 years ago, none of these people were here and this city was still New York, and 150 years from now they'll be gone and it'll still be the bricks, the buildings, and the roads. I know that you value people over things and that's not a delusion that I'm here to cure you of. However, if they don't leave, I'm gonna kill the kid. I'm gonna kill Sofia. I'm gonna kill Ricky. I'm gonna kill young Miss Berry and your little rat friend too."
"Kingston: You said leave, what do you mean?"
"Robert: I mean leave New York. I am not presuming to ask you to abandon your position, but none of those people need to suffer the fate that awaits them if they try to get in my way."
"Kingston: Well, I hate to say it, Mr. Moses, but they're all free-thinking adults who can make their own choices. As is every person in this city. Well not every person, but every adult."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
Robert: You think people make choices?
Kingston: I do.
Robert: No. People think they make choices. They think they're gonna steer right or steer left but they didn't build the roads. The big choices already got made for them a long time ago.
"Kingston: Well Mr. Moses, how about this? How about you have a choice, right now. Where you can leave this city. You can walk away. And I will not come for you. You can choose to stay here. You can choose to continue on this course of action and me and my friends can choose to stop you. Clean and simple. And that's much easier than me trying to get the five of them to go one way or another."
Brennan: He nods.
Robert: It's your message to give as you wish. You have a pleasant day.
Kingston: Take care.
Robert: Give my regards to Liz.
"Lou: [sighs] You said, can I slap him?"
Brennan: Yes. Make an attack roll.
Lou: Great. Just plus Strength?
Brennan: Strength and proficiency yeah.
Lou: That's gonna be a modified 19.
"Brennan: You front hand, pow! And leave a singed hand mark of ash on the side of his face. You see he goes,"
"Robert’s face snaps back away from Kingston’s slap. He raises a hand to the handprint, takes some of the ash, and licks it off his finger."
"Robert: Check your phone, Mr Brown."
"Brennan: And he walks away. Your phone blips, it's a text from Emiko saying,"
Emiko: Need you at the hospital.
"Kingston: Hey kids, I'm sorry I know you're having fun here at the museum but we have to go."
"Brennan: You head out, normally you would I imagine escort them all the way back home but Eliza's old enough that she can take Jamil and Cooper back to the place, she knows and she looks up at you and you see a little flash of something that was in your eye as a child as she goes,"
"Eliza: Oh, Kingston, I can do it. I'll take care of it."
"Kingston: Thank you so much, ‘Liza."
"Brennan: She takes off, you rush to St. Owen's. You arrive at the intensive care unit. You see Liz in traction on life support. Black and blue, unconscious breathing extremely shallow. And you can see bits of Umbral Arcana off some of the wounds that are clearly claw and fang marks."
"Kingston: Emiko, who brought her in? What's going on?"
"Emiko: 911 picked her up, she was in the neighborhood with family, she got jumped in the street. We didn't get a description of the attacker she came in like this. Police are investigating right now but it looks like they tried to kill her. We're trying to keep her alive as much as we can, but her lungs are filling up with blood."
Lou: Can I do a Medicine check—
Brennan: Yes.
"Lou: Like to see, what is possible, what can I possibly do. That's gonna be 27."
"Brennan: [impressed] Jesus. Kingston you immediately go, you see that you can heal the broken stuff, the stuff that's most immediately medically... you like, start going to work. You see that other doctors know your history with Liz and everyone is like, you're not supposed to be doing this and they're looking. You see the head medical guy, Dr. Simms comes over and says,"
"Dr. Simms: Nurse Brown, I'm gonna need you to step away."
"Kingston: Hey, I'm sorry, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen."
Dr. Simms: This hospital we have—
"Kingston: I'm sorry, no you need to step back, friend. You really do."
"Brennan: You see that he looks and your voice reverberates through the hospital and he, although he can't tell it's happening, is just like moved out of the room. You take her to a point where she is not stable but no longer in critical condition. There is some piece of necrotic undeath magic that is worming its way from her injuries slowly towards her heart. With a 27 medicine, probably like a few hours away. Maybe like eight or nine hours away."
"Lou: Would something like Death Ward or Greater Restoration do something for this, or?"
"Brennan: Yeah, potentially. You're not sure, it might be something bigger like a break curse or something like that. Greater Restoration might do it. But you're not sure because this thing is like a tangled little piece of magic and it appears that someone’s like actively concentrating on it from a distance."
"Lou: Can I text the group and say,"
"Kingston: Hi, I feel like somebody is trying to attack me. They have attacked my ex-wife, and just a little bit about there seems to be some kind of spell that somebody's concentrating on somewhere else in the city. I don't know what to do."
Rowan: Where are you?
Kingston: I am at St. Owen's.
Zac: I fly there on a Maserati. Peeling through traffic.
"Brennan: (imitating tires screeching) You arrive up, yet your sister is there, she says—"
"Ricky: Firefighter on duty, let me—"
Emiko: Ricky what the hell are you doing? Where did you get a Maserati?
"Ricky: No time to explain, where is Kingston?"
Brennan: You rush through to find Kingston.
Ricky: Please park my Maserati.
Emiko: What? I'm on-call! I'm here at work!
Ricky: Whatever.
"Ally: I think I take like a Bird scooter as fast as I can from wherever I am. (Ally imitating electric engine revving) It's really not going that fast but I'm like, Kingston! I'm mindlinking and I'm like,"
"Pete: I'm coming, man, do you want any food or soup broth?"
Kingston: I don't need—
Pete: I'm bringing you broth.
Zac: I'll run into the room wherever Kingston is.
"Siobhan: I'm gonna gypsy cab over there just like I have lived in New York for such a long time, I can just spot from 1000 yards away the fastest, most crazy driver out there."
"Ally: You're like, you have one eye—"
"Rowan: Follow that cab, I mean it's not actually what—"
"Brennan: A guy pulls over and goes,"
Cab Driver: [snorting something] Hi!
Rowan: Hi.
Cab Driver: I'm the cab driver of this car.
"Rowan: Yes you are, we're going to the hospital!"
Cab Driver: We're gonna take the river.
"Brennan: You see as he peels off you peel out of there. You guys arrive in the room with Kingston as you get there a message appears from Esther. You also get messages from some of you saying,"
Message: Shit’s going down in Astoria.
"Brennan: You get a message from Ana and Emilia, like,"
Ana: Someone’s attacking the old bodega.
"Brennan: You get another message, you see Esther [magic shimmering] appears in your small nurse's office. And it's her literally flying through the streets as a vid screen of magic gets her face. You see she says,"
"Esther: They're attacking the library. I just got word from Alejandro listen, the eagle, the eagle got back to me. There's a spell happening tonight at the stock exchange. That's where Moses is gonna be, that's where he is."
"Ally: Okay, I'm gonna go immediately that way."
Zac: Before I leave I'm going to touch Liz and cast Remove Curse on her.
"Brennan: Awesome. You cast Remove Curse. Go ahead and give me a flat Medicine check. This is a powerful curse, Remove Curse is going to have a chance to get rid of it but I want you to roll just a flat Medicine check."
Murph: I'm gonna cast Guidance on him.
Brennan: To add a d4.
Murph: To add a d4.
Lou: I also cast Guidance on him.
Brennan: Yes. You can add 2d4.
"Siobhan: And I'm gonna very flirtily say,"
"Rowan: Ricky, we believe in you."
Ricky: Hold on.
Siobhan: And give him Bardic Inspiration.
Zac: So that's a d8.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Zac: Okay, all right."
Ally: So d4's a d8 and a d20.
"Zaac: 18 plus five, 23."
"Brennan: 23. You cast Remove Curse. And you feel like the questing blade shines bright and you hear a voice in your ear and you see a flash of Yankee Stadium for a second and have this sudden urge to go to Yankee Stadium. But it goes away for a second, you just hear a voice saying like,"
"Voice: Champion, holder of the questing blade."
Brennan: And you see that Liz's heartbeat settles a little bit.
Murph: Go to Yankee Stadium?
Brennan: It was a momentary blip of something that doesn't necessarily feel urgent but you just got a vision of Yankee Stadium for some reason.
"Ricky: I can't explain it, but I just saw Yankee Stadium."
Kugrash: Do you guys think there's any chance that that wasn't really Esther and we were getting—
Sofia: Like they're sending us to the—
"Zac: Can we text Esther, I'll text Esther a selfie of, nevermind, I don't do a selfie."
"Murph: I'm gonna use the Bagel of All Things and ask New York where the person, although, I wanna know if we're being setup, I think the stock exchange is the place we wanna go anyway but I'd like to ask if that was really Esther."
Brennan: The Bagel confirms that it was Esther.
Murph: Okay.
"Siobhan: Can I, is there anyway to use Locate Creature to see who it was that cast this spell. Because if this happened locally this person is still pretty close probably."
"Brennan: Potentially yeah, you can cast Locate Creature."
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: You get a faint sense of them leaving the area of your spell very briefly.
Zac: I'll cast Divine Sense as well.
"Brennan: Undeath, is the nature of the curse. But the thing you detect is a vampiric magic and something fleeing."
Siobhan: And they're going south.
"Brennan: That south, yeah."
"Rowan: Well, the vampires are at it."
Kugrash: Let's go to this stock exchange.
Ricky: Can we just--
Rowan: I don't know what else to do.
Zac: I'm trying to think of what would happen at Yankee Stadium.
Siobhan: I know.
"Murph: Wait, can we check her for bites."
Lou: Yeah there was claws—
Siobhan: She's been clawed.
Emily: Claws and bites.
"Murph: Oh, so there were bites."
"Brennan: That's the other thing you see, the reason this is so complex is there's like a trace of vampirism within."
Murph: Yikes.
Rowan: What could happen at Yankee Stadium?
Pete: So should we split up a little bit or?
Ricky: I think that's--
Kugrash: I think Yankee Stadium might be for another day maybe? I don't know what you guys think?
"Rowan: I mean I've always just been a Met's girl myself, so."
Pete: The Yankees are trash.
Ricky: Maybe we could call the front desk of the Yankee stadium to see if there's a—
"Rowan: Excuse me, is this Yankee Stadium?"
"Emily: Okay, I'm on the phone."
"Brennan: That blip, that disappears from you after the moment you felt it. It doesn't feel like a pressing urgent thing within you. It feels instead like something that just occurred for a moment and then went away."
"Zac: Maybe it means we should go to a ball game, I don't know."
"Siobhan: Maybe, maybe it's the curse of the bambino but that's not here, that’s in—"
Brennan: What do you guys do?
Lou: What's the level on Liz? Because I'm not 100% comfortable leaving right—
Brennan: That last thing where you all joined forces feels like she is partially stable.
Lou: For now.
"Brennan: For now. That you at least have until maybe like 12 hours. She'll be good for a while, she's gonna remain stable for at least another—"
Kingston: You said that you felt him going south.
"Rowan: Yeah maybe we can text Em, have her come have a look at her."
Kingston: Great.
"Pete: Watch over her, yeah."
Rowan: Yeah.
"Pete: That's great. I wanna get there and I wanna get a look at Robert Moses. I wanna see, I wanna congregate."
"Emily: I wanna get to this New York Stock Exchange area, I wanna cast Jump on myself."
"Brennan: Cool, you cast Jump."
"Emily: Oh wait, is that only a minute."
"Murph: I wanna conjure my elemental again, when we get close because it lasts for an hour."
Brennan: You conjure your elemental—
"Emily: Nevermind, I don't cast Jump. But I do create an Unseen Servant."
Zac: Can Misty ride in my Maserati and get the benefits from that?
Brennan: Can't bump over 20.
"Zac: Okay, gotcha."
"Siobhan: [to Zac] Oh, it’s a Charisma thing?"
Brennan: Conjure Elemental.
Zac: [to Siobhan] Plus two Charisma.
Ally: Do we see Robert Moses when we got to the stock exchange?
Siobhan: [to Zac] I’m already the most charismatic in our group.
"Brennan: Hold on one sec guys. Let me narrate what happens. You guys get there. There's an express Harlem to Wall Street. You arrive, you rush up, you go to the stock exchange. Kugrash, it's been a long time since you've been here. You walk in, it is about now, after all the running around and Liz and everything else, it's about seven, eight o'clock at night, which around this time of year means it is pitch black. You walk up, the doors open for Kingston, even though they're usually locked at this time. Nobody perceives you, all the guards are looking the wrong way to notice you guys walking in. You get to the floor of the stock exchange. Kiosks everywhere, with the screens and the ticker. Up in the balcony with the bell you see Robert looking down at you."
Robert Moses: Welcome. I take it that Kingston's offer was either not given or rejected.
Kingston: You son of a bitch!
Pete: You're going to hell.
Kingston: I'll kill you!
Ally: I point at him too and cast True Strike.
Emily: I cast True Strike also.
Brennan: Roll for initiative.
Lou: Great.
Brennan: That's all for this week on The Unsleeping City. Tune in next week as the battle of high finance where the stakes [wiggles eyebrows] and stocks couldn't be higher.
Zac: Oh God.
"Siobhan: Money, money, money."
"Brennan: Money, money, money, money. Later!"
Siobhan and Ally: Money.

Brennan: Robert Moses is here concocting a ritual on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
Kugrash: Gonna burn it down!
Brennan: Those are vampires piloting kiosk mechs.
"Zac: Incredible, but I'm so mad."
Brennan: He reaches out and sucker punches you in the stomach and you are paralyzed.
Rowan: Are you enjoying this?
"Robert Moses: Take it easy, Miss Berry."
"Kingston: You stupid motherfucker! You come for my family, you come for my friends, I will fucking drop you."
"Robert Moses: If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere."

[RECAP]
"Don Confetti: Robert Moses didn't try to play Faerie and Hell against each other, he successfully played Faerie and Hell against each other."
"Ally: Wait, so he has everything now, right?"
"Esther: Sinatra's Law, the Imperial Axiom. If you can make it here…"
Rowan: You can make it anywhere.
Brennan: [imitates explosion] You appear to David.
"Kugrash: You don't have to forgive me, but I'm sorry."
"David: I don't have to forgive you? Well, that's nice to hear. Have a nice rest of your life, you fuckin' rat."
Esther: My family's been cursed.
Sofia: We're gonna find a way to get rid of that curse.
Robert: You think people make choices?
Kingston: I do.
Robert: The big choices already got made for them.
"Kingston: Well, Mr. Moses, how about this? You have a choice. Where you can leave this city. And I will not come for you."
"Brennan: You rush to St. Owen's, you see Liz in traction on life support."
Esther: The eagle got back to me! There's a spell happening tonight at the stock exchange!
[END RECAP]
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: Welcome, one and all to another exciting episode of The Unsleeping City! Robert Moses, King of the Undead, wheeler and dealer, mastermind of the highway hex is here, concocting a ritual on the floor of the den of evil itself, the New York Stock Exchange! [imitates explosion] Pete, you feel that infection deep in the heart of this place, wum-wum-wum-wum-wum."
Ally: [staring at the battleset] Of course.
"Brennan: You have called out to each other you have said what needed to be said, and it is going to be Kugrash as the first to act."
Ally: We're missing Rowan.
"Brennan: Oh, Rowan, that's right!"
"Pete: Has anyone seen Rowan, I—"
Brennan: Rowan does dash in.
Brennan hands Siobhan her brand new Rowan mini.
Siobhan: Oh my goodness!
"Lou: Wow, look at her!"
Murph: So spritely!
Lou: Look at that.
Emily: Let me see!
"Siobhan: I haven't changed any of my outfits, I'm just young and hot now."
[laughter]
Lou: Wow.
Ally: Cool!
Brennan: Young-- [laughs]
Kugrash: Pete—
"Pete: Hey, we’re both wearing hats! We're the only two wearing hats, that's so crazy!"
"Brennan, taking a sip of water, chokes on it from laughing and has to cover his mouth for a second."
"Zac: Uh-oh, uh-oh!"
"Lou: Brennan, are you okay?"
Ally: Uh-oh! No!
"Brennan: Oh no. (gruffly) We begin! (Normally) Kugrash, you are first to act, my friend."
"[dramatic, tense, drum-heavy music]"
"Murph: All right. So I've got my fire elemental here that I had summoned on the way over, I have my new watch, gives me Haste, it doesn't say if it uses an action to use--"
"Brennan: It does not use an action, but it only lasts for one round. So it's a free round where you have Haste on you."
"Murph: Oh, interesting, okay. Then I might save it for now. I think Kugrash--"
"Brennan: The old rat with his huge, chunky Rolex--"
[laughter]
"Murph: I'm gonna summon the juiciest cockroach I know,"
Kugrash: Cockrash! I summon thee!
[groans]
Ally: Come on!
"Kugrash: What, it's my name in the cockroach! Cockrash!"
Brennan: Oh!
Kingston: You have to understand what that sounds like.
"Cockrash: [high-pitched] Hi there, hey there, Kugrash!"
Brennan: Where does this little—
Murph: He's coming just to give everybody some HP.
Pete: Get the fuck away from me.
Emily: How much HP?
"Siobhan: So much now, right?"
"Kingston: Thank you, Pete, now you understand."
Brennan: How much HP does everybody gain?
"Murph: So it is 9, 5 plus my druid level, so 14."
"Emily: And then, if I leave this, do I still get it?"
Murph: Yes.
Emily: Hey!
Lou: Are there any other benefits to staying in the aura of the juicy cockroach?
"Murph: It'll give you advantage on Strength throws, but that's not really as important. And then I'm going to use my crown to summon rats."
Brennan: Incredible. [imitates thunderous sound]
Lou: It's 14? We got 14 hit points?
Murph: Yes.
Emily: Yeah!
Ally: That's amazing.
Siobhan: We’re powerful.
Lou: I'm at 99.
Ally: I'm at 93!
Emily: A Cockrash that makes you stronger.
Lou: (face in hand) Ugh!
"Brennan: Place them wherever, wheresoever you like."
Zac: That's pretty good.
Murph: I'll do—
Emily and Ally: What are you at?
Zac: 108.
Emily: Woo!
"Ally: Oh, you fucker!"
"Emily: I'm at 88, but I love to get hurt."
"Siobhan: Yeah, me and Sofia are on 88."
Murph: I'll have them kind of jamming up that—
Ally: [laughs] Sofia is a full masochist? Please hurt me!
"Siobhan: Beat me up, daddy!"
"Emily: Harm me, I want to get hurt."
Ally: I'm gonna shoot you in the leg.
"Brennan: Remember, Ox gains those as well."
Zac: I wrote that down. That over doubles Ox.
"Murph: Oh sweet. Oh yeah, and also give it to my fire elemental."
"Lou: My man, you got four rats out?"
Murph: Yes.
Lou: Damn
"Brennan: You see, yeah, Kugrash, you go into the Stock Exchange, you were a different man the last time you were here. In fact, you're not a man at all any longer, you're a fuckin' rat! And whoom, fire, rats, cockroach, the fuckin' filth of New York springs into the Stock Exchange, all of your rats and the cockroach all go,"
"Cockrash: Ugh, this place feels fuckin' gross."
Kugrash: [shouts] We're gonna burn it down! Return it to the earth!
"Cockrash: Smells like cocaine and piss and Axe Body Spray in here, it's fuckin' awful."
"Rats: [high-pitched] To arms, to arms, brothers!"
Kugrash: Yes!
Brennan: Great. So you—
"Murph: Can I run forward and I don't want to break my concentration on this guy, so I don't want to get hit, so I want to, can I hop in one of these little guys?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and hop in!"
"Murph: I want to hide in there. So that should, I'm in there."
"Brennan: Cool, dope. Wonderful. That is going to be, see Moses says,"
"Robert: All right. Let's cut it out, shall we?"
Brennan: [imitates blasting sounds] Kiosks around the trade floor begin to change and morph—
"Emily: Did I tell you, I was like, oh God, what are you doing?"
Zac: Too fast for my own good.
Murph: It felt like this.
"Ally: Same, I was like, it's the only thing to switch."
[Brennan imitates explosion]
Siobhan: Oops.
Lou: Jesus.
Brennan: They go.
Zac: Are those vampires in robots?
"Brennan: Yep, those are vampires piloting kiosk mechs of stock floor trading stuff, with a little—"
Emily claps.
"Zac: Incredible, but I'm so mad."
"Siobhan: Such bullshit, but I love--"
[laughter]
"Emily: I think it's great. I cannot wait to be hurt by them. Finally, an honorable foe!"
[Siobhan laughs]
"Brennan: You see that one of them says,"
"Kiosk Vampire: Oh boy, get a load of this, a bunch of humanities majors coming in and telling us how we should run our arcane dark ritual."
[imitates mechanical whooshing]
"Brennan: These guys rush over here. Boom, boom. These guys are actually just going to close with the rats here. Awesome. That's going to be..."
"Murph: Does the fire elemental go on my turn, or--"
"Brennan: The fire elemental goes on your turn, so you want the fire elemental to go, it can. Oh, I thought you were done with your turn, I'm sorry."
"Murph: Oh sorry, I yeah, I'd like the fire elemental I guess to attack one of these guys."
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it, have the fire elemental attack one of 'em."
"Murph: Sweet. He gets two attacks. 12 to hit, so he’s not going to do anything."
Brennan: Nope.
Murph: [laughs] 10 to hit.
Brennan: Nope.
"Murph: It's got a plus 6, I'm just doing bad!"
[Ally laughs]
"Brennan: Awesome. These vampires are gonna go for, one is coming for Sofia."
Sofia: Bring it on!
"Brennan: That's gonna be a miss, one goes for Ricky. That's gonna be a miss as well. All right. That is now going to be, and then the vampires are gonna go for the rats."
Murph: Oh no.
Brennan: What are the rats' AC?
Murph: 10. [laughs]
"Lou: Come on, rats!"
Siobhan: Squished.
"Ally: They didn't get juicy cockroach? Oh, that's not AC, all right."
Brennan: Cool. Your first rat swarm takes 7 points of damage.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: Next one takes 9 points of damage.
"Murph: Oh, okay."
"Brennan: Also, I don't believe that swarms can be grappled, right?"
"Murph: No, they can't. Immune… grapple, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah, the vampires just start slogging through those two swarms of rats. That's going to be Sofia."
"Emily: Okay. I am going to just jump all the way there. [points at a high balcony] I'm gonna use my entire action and a ki point Step of the Wind, and with the help of my Louboutins, I will soar through the air."
"Pete: You're welcome, guys. I stopped doing drugs, so I had a shit ton of extra money."
"Kugrash: Oh, thank you."
Pete: I bought you all luxury items.
Sofia: Thank you so much!
Ricky: You bought me a Maserati?
"Pete: Yeah, dude, I knew you'd love it."
Ricky looks confused.
[laughter]
Rowan: Drugs are so expensive! I have literally never bought them every time I've taken them.
Pete: Really?
Brennan: Do you have Otherworldly Leap active now or not?
"Emily: I do not. But it is still, I calculated it, and it's under--"
"Brennan: Your long jump with just Step of the Wind and the magic boots is 78 feet horizontally, which should be able to reach."
"Emily: Oh, I thought it was 90-something."
"Brennan: No. I got the calculator up right here. So it's 78, which is about, we'll just round that up to 80. So, but, you can also run and take a running start, 'cause your movement with Step of the Wind and using your action will be enough to get there and jump up. However, one of them is going to take an attack of opportunity on you."
"Emily: Bring it on, come on! Get it, would now be the time that I would have to throw up Shield?"
Brennan: Now would be the time before I announce it that you have to throw up Shield.
"Emily: Yeah, I'm gonna throw up Shield, I want to get over there, and if he grapples me, that's gonna fuck with me."
Brennan: Does a 24 still hit you?
"Emily: Yeah, it does. I think it's 24."
"Brennan: One of them reaches out, doesn't deal any damage, but grapples you and brings your movement to zero."
"Sofia: Ugh! Motherfucker, now I'm pissed!"
"Brennan: So this vampire doesn't deal any damage, grapples you, moves you to zero, but you still have your action."
"Emily: All right, I'm gonna fuckin' attack him. You little fuckin' asshole."
"Ally: How do, oh sorry."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: What do I have, what do I have? What do I have, think! Okay. Aw, does a 17 hit, no, 18 hit?"
Brennan: An eight—
"Emily: No, I'm sorry! 15."
Brennan: A 15 does not hit.
[fist slams]
"Emily: What about my backslam? No, I used my bonus action. Oh, all right."
"Brennan: But you do, you can use both attacks on him."
Emily: Oh right duh!
"Brennan: Because you do have Extra Attack, yeah."
"Emily: Whoo! That also doesn't hit. Okay, I just go limp."
"Brennan: You see that you go— You go to jump, and this huge, [imitates mechanical whizzing] claw grabs you."
"Kiosk Vampire: Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry. We're not gonna be interrupted, we're conducting a big ritual right now. Sorry about that."
"Sofia: Okay, if you're gonna at least, if you're going to stop me, could you at least do damage, because I'd like to get below 10 hit points."
"Kiosk Vampire: Oh, we'll do damage."
Sofia: Okay. Thanks.
Brennan: You see—
Lou: Oh.
Brennan: Cool. That's Sofia. The vampires are gonna go again.
Siobhan: What?
Murph: Yipes.
"Brennan: The one that's got you there, Sofia, is going to attack. Miss."
[Lou snickers]
Sofia: I thought you said you were going to do damage.
"Kiosk Vampire: It’s hard, I'm having a hard time!"
"Brennan: One of them, so this one's got you right now, Sofia."
Emily: He's essentially just holding me as I try to run away.
"Brennan: As you try to run away, exactly."
Siobhan: Pushing against your forehead as...
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: These guys take another swing and deal, this time 9 points to the first rat swarm that was injured."
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: Other one misses the other rat swarm. And then one's gonna go for Ricky. And is going to miss Ricky again.
Siobhan: Dope.
Brennan: Cool. That's going to now be Pete.
"Emily: Oh, wait a second! When he, oh, are there any guys within 5 feet of him? Goddammit, no. Nevermind."
"Zac: [to Emily] Oh, that would be sick."
Ally: I'm gonna run.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: What do I get as a normal move again? Six?
"Brennan: Six, yeah."
"Ally: Yeah. [whispers] One, two..."
"Kingston: Be careful, Pete!"
"Ally: Five, six. And then I'm going to cast Vitriolic Sphere on Bob Moses."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: So there, that's not a roll or anything."
"Brennan: Cool, range, yeah. You just do it. Awesome. So yeah. Each one in the room has to make a Dexterity saving throw. Buh-buh-buh. Wild. Cool, go ahead and roll damage."
"Ally: Yeah, did he save, or do I roll the damage first?"
"Brennan: On failed save, creature takes 10d4, on a successful save creature takes half damage and no damage at the end of its next turn. So he's gonna roll the save."
"Ally: Can I use everyone's d4s, I need 10."
Siobhan: Wow.
Murph: Shit.
"Emily: Yeah, baby. Purple and pink are so--"
Murph: Do you need more?
Brennan: He does save.
"Emily: Come on, purple and pink! Get them 4s! Come on."
Lou: (leaning over to Emily) Let's see how our kids do.
"Ally: Oh, this is 10, perfect, all right."
"Lou: Let's go, let's go."
"Emily: Make mama proud. Make mama proud. Okay, one of them says 3."
"Ally: Okay, we got a 3. 4. 7. 8. 9, 10. 12. 16. 20. 24."
"Emily: [crosstalk, to Lou] Okay, so I got the five…"
"Lou: [crosstalk, to Emily] I only got a one."
Ally: So he takes 12.
"Lou: [quietly to Emily] I feel bad, I feel bad."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: [crosstalk] You’ve spoiled them as well.
"Ally: But does that stop any sort of, is he in concentration or—"
"Brennan: So he takes 12, he's gonna roll a concentration check. Which he succeeds."
Ally: Can I make an Insight check to see what is going on with this blood on the ground?
"Brennan: Sure, absolutely."
"Ally: Cool, okay, yeah. That is a lot. 20."
"Brennan: You look at it, what would it be if it was an Arcana check? Just asking."
Ally: Oh cool. Also 20.
"Brennan: Also 20. You look at it, there is insane money magic happening here. All these symbols are currency symbols drawn in blood on the floor, and you see that he is calling the infection that is tapping into the Golden Door and he is unable to enter the dream realm, but is casting magic through this web in the dream realm, though he cannot enter it."
"Ally: Cool. And the cantrip isn't a bonus action, right? That would be a full action."
"Brennan: No, some cantrips are, but it will say on the cantrip if it is."
"Ally: Okay, cool, awesome. Thanks, everybody. These look so cool."
Emily: Right?
Lou: We have great dice.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Pete, go ahead and give me a Wild Magic roll."
"Ally: Oh yeah, fuck. 14."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: [handing the dice back] These are everyone’s.
Siobhan: I'll pass them on.
Ally: Grab yours.
"Brennan: Kingston, that's going to be you."
"Lou: Okay, my man. How electric are, yeah. How electronic do these mechs look?"
Brennan: They look pretty fucking electric.
Lou: I'd like to cast a fifth level Shutdown spell.
[Everyone] Oh!
Siobhan: Shut it down!
"Lou: And so all electronic devices not in use will shut down and I believe each one of these mechs will have to make, anything that's not in use will get shut down."
Emily: Not in use. These can't be turned into them.
"Lou: And then these four dudes will all make Constitution saving throws, and if they succeed, I think they prevent it. But if they don't, their electronic device will be shut down and cannot be restarted."
Ally: [whispering] Fuck yeah.
"Emily: Is this like a sleep spell, almost?"
"Brennan: Holy shit, no there's, they can do Constitution saves to try and avoid it, but Kingston, this is some powerful fucking magic."
Ally: Level 5!
Lou: 5!
[clapping and cheering]
Brennan: Incredible.
Emily: Is this your first level 5?
"Brennan: What is Kingston's step up, 'cause you are fuckin', you just called out Robert Moses."
"Lou: Yeah, I step forward, I say,"
Kingston: You stupid motherfucker!
[laughter]
Emily: Yeah!
"Kingston: You come for my family! You come for my friends! I will fuckin' drop you, and anyone you attempt to bring at me!"
Lou: And then I just slam my fuckin' fists on the ground.
"Brennan: You guys hear the roar of crowds from all over the city as New Year's Eve celebration lend all of their power and, [imitates thunderous sound], all of these kiosks that were on, the screens fucking blow out and they shut down. The only things that get a roll are Moses and the tickers up here, and these four here."
Emily: Oh my God.
Brennan: So I'm gonna roll for them.
Emily: I hope my guy fucks up!
"Brennan: Buh-buh-buh, so this is a Constitution saving throw against a DC17."
Sofia: Did anyone else notice that Kingston called us his friends?
Pete: Yeah! And I was so happy.
[laughter]
"Brennan: Okay. You see Kingston, you burn through with holy power of this city, this one dodges behind a kiosk, all of the rest, vampires, go ahead actually and make a Religion check for me."
"Lou: Dut-dut-doo, only 7."
"Brennan: Mm-hmm. Cool. You're not sure exactly what you're seeing, but you see that these undead, undead are creatures more so than fiends or celestials or fae or anybody, undead are creatures of pure willpower. By the strength of their will alone, they cling to life after death. They have a pool, an extremely limited pool, of times where they can burn through some of that willpower to straight up just resist magical effects. You see that three of these have to dig deep into that pool of stuff that's literally keeping them alive to prevent your spell from working. None of the mechs shut down, all of them have used a vital resource to prevent that from happening. I'm gonna roll for Robert Moses, 'cause this range on this spell is fucking crazy. Does he, no, he doesn't get advantage on this. Okay. Okay."
"Siobhan: Wait, does that mean that Robert Moses is mechanical?"
"Brennan: No, it means that he's protecting this spell up here on the ticker. He successfully does that, he does not burn up some of his resistance. That is your action, are you taking any moves?"
"Lou: Yeah, I'll move up just behind Pete."
"Brennan: Okay. Wild. That was extreme, I know that feels like they're still active, but the thing that they've burned up is incredibly valuable. That is now going to be… Mr. Moses. You see that Robert looks out and says,"
[dramatic music]
"Robert: As I call upon the names of those that have passed, and the power given to me of life and death,"
"Brennan: And you see that all of the money figures on the tickers begin to go up and down, up and down, you see that he goes,"
Robert: Neither Heaven nor Hell can claim me.
"Brennan: And he pulls Santa's list out of his coat, and whoom, it glows, and then he just discards it casually to the floor, no longer needing it. He also casts a spell on himself, anyone's welcome to make an Arcana check if they'd like."
Siobhan: I would like to cast Counterspell on whatever it is.
Brennan: You are not in range. 60 ft.
Siobhan: Goddamn!
Ally: 16.
Zac: Oh!
Brennan: 16.
Zac: I got a...
Siobhan: I'll do an Arcana check.
"Zac: What was it, Arcana?"
Lou: 11.
Siobhan: 5.
"Zac: 17\. Just a flat 17, I have nothing to Arcana."
"Brennan: A flat 17, you got a 16. You remember this from one of the phantasma memories from the Metropolitan Museum of Memories. He's casting a powerful anti-magic spell on himself. Like, big whammy anti-magic stuff that's almost like a force field or bubble through which magic cannot pass on him. Ricky, you recognize this from the night you were flirting with Esther and looking at magic books, it's called a Globe of Invulnerability."
"Ricky: Guys, I think this is the Globe of Invulnerability."
[laughter]
Pete: What does that mean? What?
Brennan: Awesome.
"Ricky: Nothing can get, uhhhh..."
Emily: It's probably gonna be really hard to get to him or something.
Ally: I'm gonna shoot him.
"Siobhan: Yeah, we should just fuck him up."
Brennan: Cool. That's going to be Ricky.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: Oh sorry, no, no, no. That was Robert, that's right, that's going to be Rowan."
"Siobhan: Wonderful. So this Locate Creature is still running, can I figure out who one of these vampires is, dismiss the spell, and then cast a different spell, or is that—"
"Brennan: Sure, yeah, absolutely."
Siobhan: Great. So I would like to figure out which one of these people fucked up my friend.
Brennan: The Locate Creature was cast by this vampire over here.
"Siobhan: Okay, great. So I let Kingston know,"
"Rowan: Hey Kingston, it's the one to your left. That's the guy you want to fuck up."
Kingston: Good to know. Thank you.
Ally: We both look at each other like…
"Siobhan: And then how large would you say these kiosks were? Object-wise, would you say that they were large?"
"Brennan: I would say that they were large, yes."
"Siobhan: Great. So I would like to cast Animate Objects. So I can do 10 objects. But it's 10 tiny objects and each large object counts as 4 objects, so I can get 2 of them. So what I would like to do is, I would like to Misty Step up to here."
Brennan: Okay. You're not going to be able to cast two spells in a round if you Misty Step.
"Siobhan: Fuck, you're right, shit."
Ally: Climb.
Zac: Can’t you just do it from the ground?
Siobhan: I definitely can't climb.
Pete: I could give you a hand.
Rowan: No.
"Kingston: Okay, Pete."
"Kugrash: All right, Pete, calm down."
"Kingston: Head in the game, Pete!"
Pete: [defensively] I would give anyone a hand!
"Ricky: Thanks, Pete!"
Pete: You're welcome.
Ricky grins and wiggles his shoulders.
"Siobhan: How far away is that bell up there? That cute, tiny little bell?"
"Brennan: That cute, tiny little bell? That's probably 150 feet away, or something like that."
"Siobhan: Great, so, I'm gonna fuckin' risk the attack of opportunity on me from this guy coming."
"Ally: He's grappling someone, though."
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, he's already grappling Sofia, so he can't grapple a second person, right?"
"Brennan: He actually can’t, well, do what you're gonna do."
"Siobhan: Great, well, I'm gonna run so that I'm within 120 feet of the bell."
"Brennan: Yes. Although Sofia, he actually, no. He's actually already used his reaction to--"
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: Grab Sofia, so you actually are free."
"Siobhan: Dope, so I'll get within 120 feet of that."
"Brennan: Cool. One, two, three, four, five. Let me see if that's… Yep, you're within 120."
Pete: Hey. Did you want to talk or something?
Rowan: Not right now.
"Pete: Weird, mixed signals."
Siobhan: And I would like to animate these two ones in the middle right here.
Brennan: Incredible.
Siobhan: And then the bell.
Brennan: And then the bell!
Siobhan: Yes.
Brennan: Awesome!
"Siobhan: Oh, mm. Actually, would you say that the door, how big would you say the door was?"
"Brennan: Oh, the door?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, the door directly behind Robert Moses."
Brennan: I'd say it's medium. Medium size.
"Siobhan: Great, so a medium target counts as two objects, so I would like to animate those two kiosks and the door directly behind Robert Moses."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Great.
"Siobhan: And then, you have the--"
Brennan: I have the cards right here. I do.
Siobhan: You have door stats over there?
Murph: You got door stats and kiosk stats--
"Brennan: I got stats for everything, it's based on the size of the object. Wild. Awesome. So this is normally, so the reason that you, your fire elemental's going to act on your turn 'cause you already had it as you entered. These ones, I'll need you to roll initiative for."
"Siobhan: Okay, great. So that is a 2. Oh, so they go directly after me?"
Brennan: Or soon.
"Siobhan: Or soon, okay, great. That's dope. That's actually good. I'm good, I'm happy. I'm happy with that initiative."
"Brennan: So what has happened, Rowan runs up, young, vivacious, the first battle in this new body, and what do you say to these things?"
Rowan: It's time to get to work! [claps]
"Brennan: This little, [claps] Broadway fairy princess magic, you see the two kiosks go, Whoom!"
"Kiosks: [singing, deep-voiced] It's time to get to work! Time to fight on behalf of Rowan, bum, bum, buh-bum!"
"Brennan: And you see the door says,"
Door: [singing] Let me open! [sound of door slamming]
Brennan: Ka-koom! And slams into Robert Moses's ass. Incredible. That's your movement and your action. Anything else?
"Siobhan: Oh! Then I'm gonna turn to Kingston and say,"
Rowan: Hey. I believe in you.
"Kingston: Thank you, that's very, okay, okay."
Siobhan: And I give him some Bardic Inspiration.
Kingston: All right.
"Siobhan: But you know, like, you know, if your wife, it doesn't work out with her, I'm always, you know, I'm just, I’m still here."
Pete: I'm crushed. [laughs] I'm so crushed!
"Rowan: It’s 2018, why are you so..."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Rowan: Don't be so exhausting, Pete!"
"Pete: You were just so rude to me! You just clearly, I mean, if you liked both of us, that would be fine, but you just clearly don't like me and love him."
"Brennan: Cool. Another legendary actions, this vampire's gonna grab Sofia, slam you up against the wall over here, you don't take any damage."
Emily: What?
Brennan: This one's gonna take another swing at Ricky.
Sofia: Give me damage!
Brennan: Ricky. You are grappled by this one over here.
"Zac: Okay. Oh, do I, nevermind."
"Brennan: These two are gonna take some more swings. That's gonna be a hit. That's, and that's gonna be a crit."
Emily: Fuck.
Zac: On who?
Brennan: That's gonna be another 9 damage to the rats over there.
"Murph: Okay, they're not looking good."
Siobhan: That's what they're there for.
Brennan: And then the other is gonna be 7 points of damage to the other rats.
Murph: 'Kay. They're looking a little better.
"Ally: They're at least taking them off our hands, that's great."
Siobhan: Right.
Murph: It's what the rats are here for.
"Rats: [high-pitched] To arms, to arms! Let us die that a new era may dawn!"
"Kugrash: Oh, you're so brave, you beautiful bastards!"
Brennan: Incredible. That is going to be Ricky. You are grappled.
"Zac:: Grappled, eh? Okay. Ricky is--"
Murph: You have advantage on Strength checks within the cockroach's thing.
Lou: All right!
Murph: So you can--
Zac: Oh yeah?
Murph: Probably get out easier than normal.
"Zac: But it's still a massive robot, right?"
"Murph: Yeah. I think with grapple, you can still attack, right? Your speed's just zero?"
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: What's the cockroach's range?
"Brennan: The actual rules, 'cause it's a little bit tricky. So the actual rules are, escaping a grapple is a full action, which is your athletics check. You can also make a shove as a single attack, so if you have the extra attack action, you can actually kind of make two attempts. But shove is you moving the thing out of your square."
"Zac: Gotcha. Let me check this other ability I have real quick. I think… I think I'll attack it with, [laughs] I'll attack it with Ox first."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: It gets Pack Attack, Pack Tactics."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Okay, so… Ooh, a nat 20."
Brennan: Whoa! Does Ox deal radiant damage or no?
Emily: Crit for the pup.
Zac: I don't know.
Brennan: I don't know if he does or not.
"Zac: I don't think so, I don't think—"
Brennan: He is made of light.
"Zac: If you want, can he?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I want to say it's radiant damage."
"Zac: Okay, cool. And that's, and it's only 2d4."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: But that's doubled, right?"
Brennan: Yes.
Zac: A 4d4?
Brennan: 4d4.
"Zac: And then plus 4. Okay. Ooh, 6. 11 plus 4. So we did 15 to that, and then now it has to take a DC11 Strength saving throw to not be knocked prone."
"Brennan: Wait, how much damage is that again?"
Zac: 15.
Brennan: Jesus.
Zac: And that's 15 regular damage.
"Brennan: You see as Ox, 15 regular damage, makes a DC10—"
Zac: 11. [laughs]
Brennan: A DC11. It succeeds.
Zac: The massive robot wasn't knocked over by the dalmatian?
[laughter]
"Brennan: No, but that would be pretty fuckin' wild."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: It does that. Yeah, Ox does the damage. You see Ox's bite with that light in it burns the machine, and you see the vampire inside goes,"
Vampire: [screams] Gah!
Brennan: And screams at that radiant damage.
"Zac: Okay, well then, I'm going to cast Branding Smite as a bonus action."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: And then, and I have to call it before I hit, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, you do."
"Zac: Okay. And just try to hit it. Ooh, does a 26 hit?"
Brennan: Sure does.
Zac: Okay. Then I'll swing my second attack. Does a 20 hit?
Brennan: A 26 and a 20 both hit.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: And you are, you're not shoving, in other words, you're just wailing."
Zac: I'm just wailing on it.
"Brennan: Cool, dope."
Zac: Branding Smite is also radiant damage.
Brennan: Woo!
"Zac: So 2d6 of radiant damage I'm adding to this. Ah, whoops. All right, so that's 9 plus… 9 plus 9 of radiant. And then on my second attack—"
"Brennan: And you're adding that plus from normal, just plus to your damage, right? D8 plus 8 plus radiant, right?"
"Zac: Yes, that's what I'm doing. I rolled a 1."
Brennan: 18 from the first one.
"Zac: And then for my second attack, I'll also do just a level 1 Smite."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: If I can do that.
Brennan: Go for it.
Zac: So...
"Brennan: And you add an extra d8, because these are undead."
"Zac: Oh, then I, should I add that to the first attack as well?"
"Brennan: But you were doing a Branding Smite, not a Divine Smite on the first—"
"Zac: Sure, sure, sure. So now it's, so, okay. So that would be 3d8 total."
Brennan: 3d8 total.
Zac: Okay. So… 15 plus….
"Brennan: 4d8, 'cause it's 2d8 from, a first level Smite is 2d8 damage, plus the d8 from your normal ax."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: Plus another d8 'cause they're undead.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: So for that second attack, you're rolling 4d8 plus 8."
"Zac: Okay, so 15 for the first two. And then 3, 18 plus 8, 26?"
"Brennan: Jesus! Hell yeah. You guys see Ricky's being held up in a claw and just, boom, boom, boom! Just hacking away at electronics as this, the cockpit fills with smoke and the vampire starts coughing. Cool. That is your turn, you're still grappled. That is—"
Zac: I should have gotten out of this.
Brennan: Buh-buh-bum.
Zac: Okay.
[Brennan imitates sputtering sounds]
Zac: What.
Siobhan: Oh shit.
[Brennan imitates electronic ticking]
Brennan: The little stock ticker goes from green to red. The objects can go.
"Siobhan: Oh. Well, I'd like to start off with the door, going for Robert Moses."
"Brennan: Sure, hold on a second. What level spell, sorry, is Animate Objects?"
Siobhan: It's a 5th level spell.
"Brennan: I'm so sorry. You are welcome to choose another target, the door actually cannot be animated because of Globe of Invulnerability, which is the spell that Robert cast."
Siobhan: Okay. And the bell is the same?
Brennan: The bell is the same. Anything on that dais pretty much.
"Siobhan: I mean, there are so few other objects. Is there--"
"Brennan: You can animate, if you want to animate your umbrella, you're welcome to do that."
"Zac: Is there a piece, like a computer on that thing?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'll animate my umbrella, so it has 30 feet of movement that's, because it doesn't have legs and arms, it flies. Cool. I'm gonna send that to attack Robert Moses."
Brennan: Cool. Dope.
"Siobhan: Oh wait, but the Globe of Invulnerability doesn't--"
Brennan: There's a chance it would just cancel out the animated object—
"Siobhan: Right, fuck. Well then, I'll send it after the robot that's attacking Sofia, then."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: Thank you!
Brennan: Rad.
"Siobhan: And then I'll have the, yeah."
Brennan: The other two get up and go to work on the others?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: These two front guys.
Brennan: Each one takes on its own?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Dope. Cool. Go ahead and roll your attacks for these objects.
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: And their stats should be on the card, there."
Siobhan: Yes.
Brennan: In very itty bitty print.
Siobhan: So the umbrella you would say was tiny or small?
"Brennan: I'll let you say it's medium, because it's, so you have one of those giant, old lady golf umbrellas."
Siobhan: Great. To hit is plus 5. Okay. So 20.
Brennan: 20 hits.
"Siobhan: Great. And then the other ones, they are large, so it's plus 6. That's, one of them is a nat 20."
Ally: Hey!
Emily: Woo! An umbrella crit!
"Siobhan: And the other one is a 4. [laughs] So, well, a 10, so--"
"Brennan: Cool, gotcha, gotcha."
Siobhan: I'll do the crit against the one on the left with the--
"Emily: Oh, it was one of the—"
"Siobhan: Kingston's,"
"Rowan: I'm just gonna soften him up for you, Kingston."
"Kingston: Good, I appreciate that."
Brennan: Cool. Go ahead and roll damage.
Siobhan: 2d6 plus 1 for the umbrella. So that's 8 damage.
"Brennan: Over there, great."
"Siobhan: For the umbrella, and then, large, 2d10 plus 2. Which one is a d10?"
Brennan: That would be 4d10 plus 2.
"Siobhan: So 4d10 plus 2. Oh I have, here we go. Well, 10, 13, 15."
"Brennan: Damn. Cool. Yeah, it goes over and just fuckin' wallops those ones."
Siobhan: And--
Brennan: Boom boom!
"Siobhan: Does the attack, it does, in attacking the one that's attacking Sofia, does that make it let go of its grapple, or to have to do--"
Brennan: No.
Siobhan: A check to let go of its grapple?
"Brennan: No, it doesn't have to do a check or anything like that."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: We are back to Kugrash, to the top of the order."
"Murph: Sweet. I think, can I have my monsters go before me?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Murph: Is that cool, sweet. So I'll have the fire guy go after the robot that's holding Ricky."
Ally: [laughs] Ricky! Literally a fire is trying to help save you.
[laughter]
Ricky: You’re on my side?
"Kugrash: Allies at last, I got your favorite thing, you're a fireman, right?"
"Ricky: It's, I like it."
[laughter]
Murph: Goddamn it! First one misses. 19 on the second attack.
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Does that hit?
"Brennan: 19 hits, yes."
Murph: Sweet. Okay. 8 fire damage.
"Brennan: 8 fire damage, gotcha."
[imitates roaring flames]
"Murph: And then the rats'll go, these two guys'll go after this guy, the two guys will go after the other guy."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Murph: They're gonna have a hard time, I'm sure. One guy got a 17."
Brennan: 17 hits.
Murph: Sweet! That's 7 damage to the guy over here.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: And the other two guys are gonna go. First guy misses. Second guy hits. So 20 to hit.
Brennan: Nice.
Murph: 11 damage.
Brennan: To this one again?
Murph: To the other one.
"Brennan: The other one, gotcha, cool."
Murph: One missed on both sides.
Brennan: Gotcha.
"Murph: And then as Kugrash, I've got Concentration going so I can't do too, too, too much, but I'm going to turn into a giant eagle."
Brennan: Woo!
"Murph: I turn into a giant eagle, and hey, why not? Let's go crazy here. I turn into a giant eagle, I'm gonna use my Rolex to do haste."
Ally: Yes!
Siobhan: Sick.
"Murph: And I'm gonna use my dash action, I have 80 flying speed, I'm gonna fly to Robert Moses."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Murph: And then make attacks.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Beak attacks?
"Murph: Yeah, it's 160 feet of movement with the--"
Ally: Fuck yeah! [Brennan imitates bird calls] So American! [sound of eagle screech] Fuck you and your greed!
Brennan: [singing] Proud to be an American!
"Ally: [singing] Where at least I know I'm free! [normal voice] So sassy, such a sassy line!"
"Lou: [singing, waggling his finger] At least I know I'm free!"
Ally: At least I know I’m free!
"Brennan: Yeah. Incredible! Awesome, you've dashed towards him."
Murph: Sweet. 20 to hit?
Brennan: 20 hits!
Lou: Get that beak action.
Murph: That's my talons. My talons do 9 damage.
Emily: Hmm.
Brennan: Incredible.
Murph: And then I do a beak attack.
Kugrash: [imitates a very sad bird call] I'm a real shit eagle.
Ally: [laughs] Yeah! [pretends to choke in the middle of a bird call]
"Murph: Oh, sweet! That's 22 to hit."
"Brennan: Yeah, so how much damage does the first one do?"
Murph: What did I say...
"Ally: 9, I think?"
"Murph: 9, I think."
"Brennan: 9, cool."
"Murph: Yeah, okay. 9, and then I got 21 to hit on the second one. The beak does less, that'll be 5 damage on the second attack."
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: Fuck yeah!
Brennan: In-fucking-credible.
"Ally: That's such a great look! Him under all those tickers, fighting a literal eagle."
[Emily laughs]
Siobhan: This game is dumb as hell.
Ally: KFC commercial.
Brennan: That's Kugrash.
"Siobhan: It's so random, people will love it."
Zac: Can I get his body out?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it. Gonna get his little rat body—"
Lou: His body out of here.
Zac: Get the little rat body out of here.
Brennan: Get the rat body out of here. I'm going to need Kugrash to make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of his turn.
Murph: Yipes!
Emily: Hmm.
Murph: 19.
"Brennan: Moses looks at you and says,"
"Robert: Bruce Kugrich, you look different than the last time I saw you."
[Zac laughs]
"Kugrash: I wasn't a rat or an eagle, yeah!"
"Robert: I'm gonna give you this one chance to run, and if you don't take it, understand me, as a man of my word."
Brennan: And you see that the lich Robert Moses has his eyes sink into his head.
Robert: I'm gonna kill you right here in front of all your friends.
Brennan: The fear effect does not take hold.
"Emily: Yeah, baby! I gotta get up there, I'm immune to it."
Murph:
"Kugrash: Yipes! Hey guys, he's a lich, that's bad!"
Pete: What does that mean? Can we Mind Link?
Kugrash: I think that means he can become a god or something! [laughs]
Brennan: That's going to be—
"Zac: It's like a very powerful, evil..."
"Brennan: The vampires. This one is going to, has got--"
Ally: Do the turnstiles get attack of opportunity on them?
Lou: [laughs] You know those turnstiles.
Ally: What are they? I don't know. Kiosks?
Brennan: Does a 19—
"Emily: Does hit, yeah."
Brennan: 19 does hit. Okay. You take—
Emily: What are we doing?
Lou: What are we doing? What's the damage?
"Emily: What's the damage, I'm ready."
Brennan: You take 13 damage.
Emily: 'Kay.
Brennan: And your HP max is automatically reduced by 8.
Emily: Okay.
Murph: Sheesh.
"Brennan: So that's that one. This one's gonna go the same for Ricky. Hits. Ricky, you take… 4 damage. Your HP max is reduced by 3."
Emily: So how does that factor in with the cockroach thing? Does that do—
"Brennan: I actually think that you're, because—"
Emily: My HP max is based on what the cockroach—
"Brennan: No, 'cause it is attacking your life force. So when it's, the hit points you're actually losing are coming out of your temp HP, when you start eating into your real hit points, that decrease will follow you and bite into your regular HP."
Zac: So it affects your real ones.
"Brennan: It affects your real one, yeah. That one over there does that."
Emily: I don’t like that.
"Brennan: And this one's also gonna move with you, Ricky, over here. [imitates heavy step]"
"Murph: Oh, that's bad."
Zac: Dammit.
Brennan: And then these ones are gonna go again for these fuckin' rats. That's gonna be— 10 damage to the rats over here.
"Murph: That, wait, which side?"
Brennan: These ones over here.
Murph: Dead.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Bye! You fought well.
[Ally laughs]
"Brennan: The other ones over here, that's gonna be another 9 damage to these ones over here."
Murph: 2 HP left on that—
Brennan: Jesus Christ!
Ally: Go rats!
Lou: Go rats.
Ally: They're beefy. My brothers!
"Brennan: That is, the vampire's just smashing, [sound of thundering footsteps]"
"Kiosk Vampire: We're very effective, but these rats, they're so scrawny!"
Rat Swarm: [high-pitched] We are many in number and strong in spirit!
"Brennan: [normal voice] That's the vampires' turn. That's going to be now, buh-buh-bum. You also see that, except for the, this one still looks a little bit injured. One, two, three all heal their wounds. This one's still a little bit injured, that one does not heal or regenerate over in the corner."
Zac: Oh.
"Murph: Oh, 'cause he's taken radiant damage?"
Emily: He's taken radiant damage.
"Ally: That's not fire, right? That's light?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, it's about goodness."
"Ally: Huh, interesting."
Emily: I can do radiant damage if I get fucked up.
"Brennan: Sofia, that's gonna be you."
Emily: Okay. Would disengage get me out of a grapple?
"Brennan: Disengage would not get you out of a grapple. It's just about not having attacks of opportunity. So to get out of a grapple, you need to either find a way to move your, force them to move, or to just break the grapple on an Acrobatics or Athletics check. But that takes a full action."
"Emily: Okay, I'll probably do that, I do have my Unseen Servant, can I tell my Unseen Servant to take the battery out? Or to press off?"
"Brennan: You can have, have your Unseen, actually, your Unseen Servant cannot make attacks."
"Emily: Okay. It wouldn't be an attack, it would be sort of a menial task. Okay, yeah, that's fair. All right, so I'm going to do an Acrobatics check to get out."
"Brennan: You can either do that or attempt to shove it, but either way."
Emily: And shoving it would be--
Brennan: Strength.
Emily: Strength. Would I get that strength bonus?
"Brennan: So you can use Strength, you can use an Athletics check in place of one of your attacks, which will leave your other extra attack, or you can use Acrobatics, which is a higher score for you, but it will take your action."
Emily: I'm gonna take my action.
Brennan: Cool. Let me know what your Acrobatics roll is.
Emily: Okay. 26.
"Brennan: 26, you escape the grapple."
[Emily claps]
Siobhan: Sick.
"Emily: And that's my action, but then I'm gonna use another ki point to take a dash."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: And I just want to go as far as I can, I want to kick around the blood."
"Brennan: Okay, if you—"
Ally: I was thinking of doing that too!
Emily: Really?
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. If you would like to, okay. So, if you're not taking a Disengage, this thing will get an attack of opportunity on you."
"Emily: Oh, I have to, um."
Brennan: You can take the risk and hope it doesn't hit and do the dash.
Emily: It's going to fucking hit me.
Zac: Hmm.
"Emily: Fuck it. All right, I'm just gonna take a Disengage and go as far as I can."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: I gotta go pretty far.
"Brennan: Yeah, 45 is not bad."
Emily: 45.
"Brennan: So as your bonus action is Disengage, so you're gonna move, yeah, nine squares."
"Emily: So, okay, yeah. I'm just gonna get up here."
Brennan: Cool. Start running as fast as you can. Rad. That is your turn.
"Emily: And then, I do have a question, is Otherworldly Leap, is that something that, does that take an action for me to use? 'Cause it says that I can do it without spending a spell slot."
"Brennan: Exactly. It doesn't take a spell slot, but you, it does take an action to cast."
Emily: All right.
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: [whispers] 6, 17. [normal voice] You see that Robert Moses flicks a hand at you, and a scorching ball of fire hits you for 28 points of fire damage."
Emily: Me?
Brennan: You.
"Emily: Wait, Robert Moses?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: Except I do have something, fire, is it Fireball?"
Brennan: It—
Emily: I have Evasion. Lets me dodge out of the way.
"Brennan: This is an attack roll he's making, it's not a dexterity check. He just hit you with the Fire Bolt cantrip."
"Emily: A fireball cantrip? Okay, I Hellish Rebuke him."
Brennan: [laughs] Awesome. You Hellish Rebuke him and his Globe of Invulnerability cancels it out.
Emily: All right. That was what I did.
Brennan: 28. Now—
Ally: Are you close to radiant damage?
Siobhan: He did 28 damage with a cantrip?
Brennan: Yes he did.
"Siobhan: Fuck, man."
"Brennan: These guys are going to take a move. One, two, three, four, five, six. This guy is not going to trigger attacks of opportunity, but moves over here to the other side of Sofia."
"Emily: No, are you fucking kidding me?"
Brennan: Legendary actions. Is not taking an attack yet. And then this guy is going to take another swing at these rats over here.
Ally: [laughs] It's really funny to look and see Ox is just next to a raging fire.
Brennan: 7 points to those rats over there.
Murph: They're gone.
Ally: They're just alone.
"Brennan: And then this one's gonna take another swing at Ricky. And that's going to be… He gets a 20 on that, which I believe does hit you."
Zac: Hits me.
"Brennan: And you're going to take, he opens the cockpit, brings your body down, bites into your neck and starts draining your blood."
Zac and Siobhan: [gasps] Fuck!
"Brennan: You take 7 points, sorry. You take 11 points of damage, and your max is reduced by 6. That is gonna be Pete."
"Ally: Great. [sighs] Okay, I'm gonna run and, can I try to jump through the middle of this? Jump in there and jump out, and keep running straight?"
"Brennan: You can make an Acrobatics check to be able to do that, yeah."
"Ally: Okay. Let's see, what is my Acrobatics? It's fine. Yeah, 18."
"Brennan: Cool. You run and whoom, your body partially separates, turning into weird, colored mist as you, [hisses] slink through there. One, two, three, four, five, six."
Ally: Great. And then I will cast Erupting Earth.
"Kugrash: Careful with the anti-magic thing, kid!"
"Ally: Underneath, 'cause then maybe the whole platform will fall, if I fuck with the--"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can try to fuck with it."
Murph: Interesting.
"Ally: Cool, so I'm casting Erupting Earth underneath the balcony that he's on, that starts to crumble, takes all the pillars down, causes the whole thing to drop."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, hold on one second. What level spell is that?"
"Ally: This is a third level, but if I cast it higher, I can add d12, so I think I'll actually cast it as my fifth level spell slot."
Murph: Ooh fuck!
Lou: We're spending all of our fifth levels.
"Siobhan: Yeah, immediately."
Ally: But it gives me 5d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save.
"Brennan: Awesome. And you're keeping it out of the range of his Globe, right?"
"Ally: Well, I'm trying to cast it under, so hopefully he and the Globe fall and encounter it."
"Brennan: Okay. We're gonna do our first Box of Doom roll here, gang."
Murph: Oh my goodness.
Ally: Bring the fuck on!
"Brennan: So this is gonna be 10 plus the spell’s level so 5, 15 is the difficulty as Moses is gonna try to attempt to Counterspell. As he attempts to Counterspell, what he rolls on this is... A spell at fourth level or higher… [whispers quietly] Okay. Moses, on a 10 or higher, is going to effectively counterspell this."
"Ally: Okay. The whole thing, or—"
Brennan: The whole thing.
"Ally: Okay, okay."
Murph: Got any kind of Bend Luck thing or anything?
"Ally: Yeah, I'm gonna Bend Luck and..."
"Zac: You don't have Bardic Inspiration or anything, right?"
Ally: No. So I'm gonna use… A sorcery point. Those are still there.
"Brennan: You're gonna do, are you gonna do Bend Luck?"
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Go ahead and roll, let's see how much harder this gets for him. He's gotta roll a 12 or higher."
Ally: Cool.
"Siobhan: Okay, can I, I can't, I have to Cutting Words after you roll, right?"
"Brennan: I believe so. But what can Cutting Words be used on, real quick? And is there any type of range on it?"
Siobhan: I don't have it written down anywhere.
"Brennan: Let me look that, that's actually very important. I'm gonna look that up real quick, just so that we're all on the same page."
Lou: I love being on the same page.
"Ally: Yeah, who has some d12s? Let's just get these ready, huh?"
"Brennan: 15. Not gonna be able to do it. Here we go. On a 12 or higher, Robert Moses Counterspells this."
Ally: No! Motherfucker!
Brennan: A 13.
Ally: Jesus.
Brennan: You see--
"Ally: If so many things had gone differently, God!"
Emily: We’re getting so whooped here!
"Brennan: You see, yeah, you run up, you see that Moses looks at you and goes,"
Robert: Kid--
Ally: Wait!
Robert: What are you thinkin'?
"Ally: I don't know if it's not too late, but I have Tides of Chaos, and once a day I get advantage on a roll, can I advantage that on my Bend Luck roll?"
"Brennan: No, advantage doesn't run on d20 rolls."
"Ally: Oh, okay. I got it."
"Brennan: So you, [imitates explosion] He knocks the spell out of your hand."
Emily: Oh! That is so mean! I hate this motherfucker!
Brennan: Cool. That's gonna be—
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: Buh-buh-buh. Pete, give me a Wild Magic roll."
"Ally: [whispers] Oh yeah, right! [normal voice] 2."
Siobhan: Fuck.
Brennan: Yep.
"Siobhan: Okay, let's see."
Ally: Please be good!
"Zac: You get to choose between two now, right?"
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: You choose...
"Zac: I mean, that's—"
Emily: One undead among you becomes living.
"Brennan: You feel the magic, bl-bl-bluh-bl-bluh, bubbling up inside of you."
Ally: You fucker! [laughs]
"Brennan: Robert's fuckin' with you. You can either go evil to match him, or you can stay pure and try to resist what you're feeling."
"Ally: Oh, that's so hard! [sighs] Ah… I stay good! [laughs]"
"Emily: Oh, Kingston will be so proud, though!"
Ally: I stay good! God fuckin' dammit!
Emily: Say it all out loud so Kingston knows!
Lou: Say it so I know I'm proud. Let me know I should be proud of you.
"Brennan: The magic surges through your body, and all, this is literally sort of what it says, all chemical addiction within you, every residual toxin, every bit of poison, is, whoom, pushed out of you as you glow with radiant light."
Emily: Yes!
"Ally: I start crying. I start truly weeping, I'm on my knees."
"Emily: Is it just me, or does this feel like a fuckin' Phish concert in here, now? What?"
"Brennan: Incredible. At the end of Pete's turn, There, this one's gonna, I'll take a swing. Boom. Deals 4 points of damage to you, Ricky. And then, this one's going to finish moving to Sofia. [imitates thunderous movement] They're super fast. This one's gonna make an attack. Misses, Sofia, you are not grappled."
Emily: Thank you!
"Zac: Is one of them shut down, or no?"
"Brennan: No, none of them are shut down. This one's going to take a swing, actually, this one's gonna fight the fuckin' kiosk that is right in front of it. And misses that one."
"Emily: Wait a second, he missed on me? He tried to attack me and missed on me?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: [claps] Tipsy Sway, bitch! You gotta attack him!"
Cast: Yeah!
Emily: Fuckin' finally!
"Ally: Finally, it happened!"
"Emily: This is Battle Bots, baby!"
Siobhan: Push that robot over!
[laughter]
"Brennan: Jesus Christ! You see that, you are there fighting, this thing goes to hit you, you roll on your back, do that full breakdancing, capoeira legs around move, and its fist, woo, bam! And cracks the glass shield of its friend over here."
Emily: Does that mean I could rush in there and attack the vampire?
Brennan: No.
Emily: Damn!
"Ally: Oh, we gotta keep track of which one has the concentration spell on your ex."
"Lou: Yeah, I know which one."
"Ally: It's the one on the right, right?"
Lou: Yeah.
"Ally: Oh left, sorry."
Siobhan: The furthest one on the left.
Ally: Yeah.
"Emily: Oh, so furthest one on the left? The one that I just made attack someone else?"
Lou: The one you just made—
Siobhan: Get attacked.
"Lou: Get attacked, the one who's cracked."
"Brennan: Kingston, that's gonna be you."
"Lou: All right. In the spirit of Pete, can I, do I, can I roll Insight to see if I think that these mech vampires would be susceptible to Command?"
Brennan: Roll either Arcana or Religion.
"Lou: All right, let's go, ah. They're the same. It's 10."
"Brennan: You're not sure, you know for sure that Moses is not, you could go either way on the vampires."
"Lou: All right, I'mma try it. I'll cast a second level Command spell on these two, the two around Sofia."
Brennan: Cool. What is the command you were issuing forth to them?
"Lou: Smash, and I point at the pillars underneath Robert Moses."
"Brennan: Okay. One of them resists, the other reaches deep down and burns through more of that willpower."
Lou: What the fuck is this willpower?
Emily: Hmm.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I don't like it."
"Brennan: Cool. That's your Command. Any movement that round, or no?"
Lou: Can I snake through here?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Lou: Yeah, six?"
"Brennan: Yep. One, two, three--"
Emily: Someone go kick the blood around.
"Lou: Five, six."
"Brennan: Cool. Kingston, you see Robert looks at you as you approach looking down from the balcony, he's got Kugrash around him, and you see he says, looks at you, the room grows dark, he says,"
"Robert: As a favor, to a friend and someone I respect: Who do you want me to drop? Your friend, the eagle? Or the kid? One of 'em's gotta go."
Lou: Can I stay silent?
"Brennan: You can stay silent, he says,"
"Robert: Tick tock, tick tock. [whispers] [pointing back and forth between Kugrash and Pete] Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, mama says to pick the very best one, and you are it."
Robert’s finger lands on Pete.
Brennan: [imitates magical blast] A spell releases from his fingers.
Ally: Uh - Shield.
Brennan: Pete. This spell that he is casting is a ninth level spell.
Ally: [faux confident] Mm-hmm. And Shield is a cantrip.
The group laughs.
Brennan: And this spell does not have a saving throw. This is Power Word Kill. It doesn't have a saving throw. The only thing the spell cares about is how many hit points you've got. Do you currently have less than 100 hit points?
Ally nods grimly.
"Brennan: You watch Pete's life leave his body as he falls to the ground, dead. [imitates thud]"
Zac: Do you have—
Lou: I have Revivify.
Ally: What the fuck!?
"Emily: Is it, like, dead? Or —"
"Ally: Death saving throws, or like—"
"Brennan: No saving throws, fully dead, right now."
Siobhan: [whispers] Fuck!
[imitates magical explosion]
Brennan: He--
Ally: I just got sober!
The group laughs.
Ally: Do you know how much weight was just lifted from my fucking shoulders?
"Brennan: [laughs] That is, yeah, Power Word Kill. You guys all watch Pete drop to the ground."
"Murph: [whispers] Fucking fuck. [normal voice, to Lou] You probably don't have another fifth level spell."
Kingston: I don't. But Revivify's a third level spell.
"Murph: Oh, okay, whew!"
[Lou laughs]
Siobhan: Let me at him.
Murph: [whispers] Fucker.
Lou: “Power Word Kill”?
"Brennan: Power Word Kill. Robert looks up and goes,"
"Robert: I am purified of my undeath, and thus the realms beyond cannot claim me."
"Brennan: And the water of the Fountain of Bethesda sprinkles from his hand, falls to the floor. Rowan, that's gonna be your turn."
"Siobhan: Am I within 30 feet of, can I get within five feet of Sofia?"
Brennan: You—
Emily: Yeah!
Brennan: Can get within five feet.
"Siobhan: Yes, right?"
"Brennan: Yep, absolutely."
"Siobhan: Okay, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get within five feet of Sofia, and I'm gonna say,"
Misty: Want to take a trip?
Sophia: Yeah!
Siobhan: And then I'm gonna cast Dimension Door so that we cast above his Globe of—
All: Woo!
[applause]
Siobhan: And so we fall on top of him and hopefully do some falling damage as we do that.
Brennan: Incredible!
Emily: Woo!
Ally: Fuck yeah!
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Those Louboutins are heavy.
Siobhan: Those are sharp.
"Emily: Can I hold Misty's body so that I absorb all the impact of the landing, 'cause I have Slow Fall."
"Brennan: Give me just an Athletics check, low DC, just to hold on to Misty while you fall."
Emily: Okay.
Siobhan: Sick.
Emily: 12.
"Brennan: Cool, you do it. You grab Rowan around the waist, and slide to the ground."
"Emily: As I'm falling, I'm like,"
"Sofia: If only Pete could see this! Actually, maybe it's better he can't see this!"
"Brennan: You Dimension Door. Boom, you appear."
Murph: Fuck yeah!
"Brennan: You guys fall to the ground here as you're Slow Falling, you don't deal any damage, but you don't take any damage either."
"Siobhan: Okay, great. That's fine."
"Brennan: Cool. At the end of your turn, I'm going to need Kugrash, Sofia, and Rowan to all give me Constitution saving throws."
"Siobhan: Okay, can I also before I, 'cause I have not done a bonus action yet."
"Brennan: Oh yeah, go for it, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Siobhan: I would like to… Turn to Sofia and be like,"
"Rowan: Hey, thanks."
Sofia: My God! Anytime!
"Siobhan: Cute and flir, and now—"
"Sofia: Misty Moore who, this is my new hero!"
[laughter]
Siobhan: Now you have Bardic Inspiration. So it's a Constitution saving throw?
"Brennan: Constitution saving throw, that's correct."
Ally: Who has Bardic now?
"Emily: I do. Constitution saving throw, is this an area effect, or fearing, or charming?"
Brennan: Your Evasion only is for Dexterity saving throws.
"Emily: No, but I have Stillness of Mind, so I can't be charmed or frightened."
Brennan: This is not a charm or a fright.
Emily: Okay.
Siobhan: I got a 7.
Brennan: 7?
"Siobhan: In Constitution, I got a 15."
Brennan: 15.
Emily: I got a 15 as well.
Brennan: 15 as well.
Emily: Should I use the Bardic Inspiration for that? I'm gonna use the Bardic Inspiration for that.
Emily: Cool. I got an 18.
"Brennan: You got an 18 for the Bardic Inspiration? Okay. Rowan and Kugrash, you take 11, 15, 17, 22 points of damage each, you take 11 points of damage. You see Robert just goes,"
Robert: [shouting] I'm starting to lose my patience! [imitates whooshing]
"Brennan: And just the power of raw death surrounds him, and fluttering, ashy scraps of dollar bills, [imitates fluttering] flutter around him. After this damage, I'm gonna need Constitution checks from Kug and from Rowan."
Siobhan: Again?
"Murph: God, oh wait. So I got 14."
Brennan: So you got a 14.
"Murph: So what was that, half of--"
Brennan: You're only trying to beat an 11.
"Murph: Okay, cool."
"Siobhan: Oh, I got an 11."
"Brennan: You got an 11, you succeed."
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: You pass. I'm also gonna need another one for the conjured rats as well.
Murph: Oh shit. Are they—
"Brennan: There's some left, but so go ahead and give me that."
"Murph: Oh, just to keep—"
"Brennan: For concentration, yeah."
"Siobhan: Oh, concentration."
Murph: They're gone.
"Siobhan: Oh, I think I have, oh, I have advantage on that anyway. That's worse, well. Anyway."
Brennan: You just barely—
"Siobhan: I succeeded it, so it doesn't matter."
"Brennan: So you guys hold on to your spells, the rats, phew, scatter and vanish. That's Robert's turn. These guys are gonna go. One, two..."
"Kingston: Ricky, are you okay? [laughs]"
Ricky: I'm having a horrible time.
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Brennan: [Brennan] One, two, three, four, five, six."
Emily: We’re getting so fucked.
"Murph: Ricky's next to some fire, watching his friend be killed, being held up against a wall."
Zac: Awful!
Murph: By a stronger person.
"Emily: So he's kind of standing in the blood, they're tracking the blood around, that's not having any effect?"
Brennan: Doesn't seem to be having any effect.
Zac: All right.
Ally: I was gonna slide into the blood as a whole action.
Emily: I was gonna Slip n' Slide.
"Brennan: Cool. That is going, that was Rowan, that's that. Ricky, that's gonna be you."
"Zac: He is out of the thing now, right?"
Brennan: Who's out of the thing?
"Zac: He's opened the hatch to bite me, right?"
Brennan: Yes he has.
"Zac: Oh God. I guess, I don't have any of the information for Suggestion in front of me, but that is a Wisdom saving throw, right?"
"Brennan: Correct, yes."
"Zac: And from what we know, they probably can save themselves from Wisdom saving throws, is what it seems—"
Brennan shrugs noncommittally.
"Siobhan: Yeah, maybe, probably."
Emily: Is the Wisdom what the willpower helps them resist?
Ally: I don't know.
Lou: This was a Wisdom saving throw that they pulled deep down inside of themselves and—
"Emily: Yeah, both of yours was the shutdown."
"Lou: Shutdown wasn't a Wisdom, that was Con."
"Emily: Okay, so maybe it was just saving throws."
"Zac: Well, okay."
Emily: But that was a limited resource.
Lou: Yeah.
"Zac: I want… [laughs] Ox is too far away from any of them to attack right now, right?"
"Brennan: I think so, yeah."
"Zac: I guess Ox will, I want, [laughs] because the hatch is open, I want Ox to run in and jump up and attack the vampire."
Brennan: Go for it! Have him attack.
"Emily: Aw, so cute! Like going through a doggy door."
"Ally: Wait, those fire hasn't been going."
Murph: He's gone.
"Ally: Oh, okay."
Murph: He's been fighting the guy that Ricky—
"Zac: So that will be… What am I adding to this? Oh, that's a 15."
Brennan: 15 misses.
"Zac: Okay. I'm gonna… Jesus, this sucks. There's no, I guess I'll… I'm gonna cast Suggestion on him, and tell him to throw me at Robert. [laughs]"
Brennan: Okay! He's going to make a Wisdom save.
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: I love that.
Brennan: He succeeds on the Wisdom save.
Emily: Aww.
Brennan: Brutal.
Zac: Okay.
"Emily: Brennan, it'd be so fun if he did it, though!"
Lou: Wasn't it fun with Sondheim? I thought you let that happen.
"Siobhan: Daddy please, please let us stay up late!"
"Lou: Come on, Daddy!"
[laughter]
Zac: This is terrible.
"Brennan: Sorry! I'm so sorry. That's going to be, yeah, Ricky's not looking great, all the way back over there. Objects are gonna go?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: So. For the umbrella, I would like for it to take, so it's over here."
Brennan: Yes.
"Siobhan: I'd like for it to take a dash action towards, let me know if you'll let me do this."
Brennan: Sure.
Siobhan: A dash action towards the one holding Ricky.
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: And then open.
Brennan: Okay!
Siobhan: So it's in the way of everything.
Brennan: Cool!
"Siobhan: It's just like a, he can't see properly, and he can't get to his buttons."
"Brennan: Trying to fuck up his shit, cool."
"Siobhan: Right. He can't attack, but—"
Emily: Obscuring his view of the field.
Ally: That's cute.
"Brennan: Cool, it goes, it pops open. Great."
Zac: His what?
Siobhan: It—
"Ally: I would imagine you would get advantage now, or he gets—"
"Brennan: The umbrella opens up, cool. That's not gonna have a numerical effect this turn, but it can help, it can create disadvantage on the attacks for that thing, yeah."
"Siobhan: And then I'll have one kiosk, can the closer kiosk get to Ricky?"
"Brennan: The closer kiosk can get to Ricky, I believe, right?"
Siobhan: Great.
Lou: Which two are they? That's the real question.
Zac: Am I over here?
Siobhan: I'll have that one attack--
"Brennan: One, two, three, four, yep. That one can get there, boom."
Siobhan: And then the other one go forward and attack this guy in the corner right here--
Brennan: This one right here?
"Siobhan: That's within 30, right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and roll—"
"Siobhan: Purple is close to me, and pink is far."
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: Well, fuck me. The 12 is not gonna hit, right?"
"Brennan: A 12 is not going to hit, no."
"Siobhan: Well, nothing hits. But at least they're there. At least they're there!"
"Emily: [laughs] That's the story of this fight, is like, I don't know."
Lou: We're there.
Ally: Oh.
Emily: At least.
Lou: They're great at running defense.
"Brennan: You see they actually, yes, these three vampires all rise up on these little risers to surround you guys up on the dais."
"Siobhan: Oh no! Oh, I don't like this at all!"
Lou: This just got wild!
Murph: Are they—
Emily: This is awful.
Brennan: Cool. That is—
One of the kiosk mech minis is kind of crooked on its stand.
"Siobhan: So he's falling, he's going, he's gone."
"Lou: Fall, fall, fall!"
"Emily: Fall, you asshole!"
"Lou: Yeah, shatter, if a mini shatters, we can't fight it!"
"Siobhan: Yeah, that's the rules, it's in the DM's guide, I read it."
Lou: It's in the DM's guide. [laughs]
Siobhan: Not even the player’s manual—
Lou: It's not a homebrew from some 12 year old. That's Wizards of the Coast.
"Brennan: We're back up at Kugrash, at the top!"
"Murph: Sweet. Cool. I'm gonna have fire elemental is gonna go after this guy that's got Ricky, it has Fire Form, so it can squeeze through a space one inch wide."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: So I want him to get in the cockpit with the dude.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
"Murph: And once he gets within five feet of him, like an actual person, it takes 1d10 fire damage, just right off the bat."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it!"
Murph: So he'll take 8 damage.
Brennan: He'll take 8 damage. Dope.
"Murph: And then it'll make its attacks. And I think it might, fire damage and catches fire. It catches fire until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 1d10 fire damage at the start of each of its turns."
"Emily: Oh, cool."
"Brennan: Cool, awesome."
"Zac: Each of its turns? It has multiple turns, right?"
"Murph: No, though, he's using legendary actions I think. Okay. So two attacks. One of 'em is a 24 to hit."
Brennan: 24 hits.
Murph: Sweet. That's going to be 16 damage.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Murph: Oh no, sorry, 13 damage."
"Brennan: This vampire's looking fucked up over here, the one that's fighting Ricky. Cool, that's your turn, Kugrash. And then what's Kugrash do, oh, that's your elemental?"
"Murph: Yeah, okay. Then my elemental, I imagine I'm about to get severely fucked up. I am going to, all right. I think Ricky can get rid of that guy. Here is what I'm going to do, I'm going to fly away, I'm gonna use my movement to get out of there."
Brennan: He's gonna go ahead and take a swipe at you as you do that.
"Murph: Hmm, okay."
Emily: Can't you just disengage?
"Murph: No, I don't want to disengage, I want to do something."
Lou: He's got plans!
Brennan: Does a 20 hit Kugrash?
Murph: Yes.
Brennan: Okay.
"Siobhan: Well that, I can use Cutting Words against."
"Brennan: Okay, yes."
Murph: That’d be wonderful.
Siobhan: Because he's right next to me.
"Brennan: He's right next to you. Kugrash's AC is an eagle, what is your AC in eagle form?"
Murph: 13.
Brennan: 13.
"Siobhan: Okay, fuck, so I've got to get a 7 or an 8?"
"Brennan: You need, no, you need an 8. You need to get it all the way to 12."
Siobhan: Well. That is a 1.
Ally: Aww! [shouting] This fucking game!
Brennan: You—
Emily: We are getting so fucked!
"Lou: Fuckin' game! No, not yet. Kind of. Kind of fucked."
Brennan: You take 13 points of cold damage.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: You take 13 points of cold damage.
"Murph: Okay, I snap out of being an eagle, and I am Kugrash again."
"Brennan: Ooh, let's get little Kug out there. I'm gonna need you to make a Constitution saving throw."
"Murph: Okay. Goddammit. Huge fail, 1 and a 2."
"Brennan: You see that as you go to fly away, you see that Robert goes,"
"Robert: Not so quick, little bird."
"Brennan: Gah, and grabs your neck and says,"
Robert: Why don't you just relax?
"Brennan: Snap! [normal voice] And you, your windpipe is crushed, you are paralyzed on the ground. You are fully paralyzed and cannot move or take actions. That is going to be—"
Siobhan: Oh no!
Lou: That was the most visceral description of—
Siobhan: So fucked up!
Lou: That was too real! [laughs]
"Brennan: This is Robert fuckin' Moses, baby!"
Ally: An eagle's neck is worth two hands at least! Eagles are large.
"Lou: Yeah, don't do one fuckin'\-- Ugh! Oh, that’s chills."
"Brennan: That's going to be, you are paralyzed, Kug."
Lou and Emily: Oh my God.
Lou: Wail on this fool. [laughs]
Brennan: That's now going to be the vampires.
Emily: I want to but I'm rolling like shit.
Ally: Did the elemental go away?
Emily: I have to hit before I can wail.
"Brennan: You see that this vampire right here is gonna make an attack, actually no, this one's gonna make a shove attempt, so this is Athletics versus Athletics."
Emily: On me?
"Brennan: On you, yes."
Emily: All right.
"Brennan: So Athletics versus Athletics, he rolled a nat 1."
Emily: I rolled an 18.
"Brennan: You succeed, the other one's gonna try to throw you off the platform as well. This one, you have to beat a 12 on an Athletics check."
Emily: I did.
"Brennan: Whoom, whoom, these two claws come at you. Also, you see that these two heal fully."
"Murph: We gotta do, fuck. We gotta do radiant damage."
"Brennan: This guy also heals, not all the way, but heals a little bit."
Zac: Can we tell if the damage on their suits and them are separate things?
"Brennan: They are not separate. They appear, it appears, you see that they have IVs of blood running through the machines into their bodies. That's going to be, so that's, they both miss there. This one is also going to now move over here, and is gonna take another swing, try to knock Sofia off."
"Emily: Oh, they—"
Brennan: Now you're gonna need to beat—
"Emily: Wait a second, oh, these aren't actually attacking me. So I can’t redirect—"
Brennan: They're not actually attacking you.
"Emily: Oh, so you're being smart, okay."
"Siobhan: Oh, I see, you're being a clever person."
Brennan waggles his finger.
Emily: So what do I have to beat?
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: Now you gotta beat a 27 on an Athletics check.
"Murph: I think we all lose, we all lose, actually, I'm not incapacitated, right? I'm just paralyzed?"
"Brennan: Paralyzed, yep."
"Murph: Okay, so my aura's still there, but we're gonna lose it if I go out."
Emily: I didn't.
"Brennan: This one, boom, and throws you to the ground, boom, prone at the bottom of the—"
"Emily: Guess what, bitch, I fuckin' jump right up when I'm prone!"
Brennan: [laughs] That's right! Drunken Master!
"Emily: Yeah, Drunken Master! [claps]"
"Ally: You do like a, [grunts and pretends to jump up]"
"Emily: I take a little nip of Smirnoff, [gasps] I’m back up."
"Brennan: That's them. That vampire's gonna take an attack on Ricky over there, and he's actually going to miss."
Zac: But doesn't he take damage from the fire?
"Brennan: At the beginning of his turn, yeah."
"Murph: I would think that, oh, he is still on fire, yes."
"Brennan: This is actually his turn, yeah."
Murph: Okay. 5 damage.
Brennan: [softly] Ooh!
"Lou: Namma, namma."
Zac: How fucked up is he looking?
"Brennan: Oh that, how fucked up is he, he's looking messed up, he's looking fucked up."
Zac: I might just try to kill him.
Brennan: That is going to be Sofia.
"Emily: Okay. Do you guys think that we should be going after Robert Moses or should I be trying to, my instinct is just to go after Robert Moses."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Lou: I feel like he is at the heart of whatever--
Siobhan: Don't worry about the vampires.
Lou: The ticker tack thing is.
"Emily: Yeah. All right, I'm going to use a, can I use my dodge now so that if I jump up, then they can't get--"
Brennan: They get disadvantage?
"Emily: They can't, oh wait, that would be disadvantage?"
"Brennan: Dodge is disadvantage, disengage is no attacks of opportunity."
"Emily: I'll take, well, since I'm doing Flurry of Blows, if I were to do Flurry of Blows, can I take my disengage before I do my Flurry of Blows? 'Cause I get it at the end of every—"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can spend a ki point do your Flurry of Blows and get no attacks of opportunity."
"Emily: Cool, that's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do that, jump up, and go after Robert Moses."
"Brennan: Jesus. So all of them go to swing, you miss, Drunken Master twirl through the air, no need for a jump check, you pop straight out, it's only like what, a 20 foot straight high jump?"
Siobhan: Easy!
Emily: And I'm going after Robert Moses. First attack is a nat 20!
"[cheering, applause]"
Ally: [clapping] That's what we need!
"Emily: I would also like to point out to Robert Moses that,"
"Sofia: When you hit me back there, I don't know, something about it jostled something up, and I'm looking pretty radiant, wouldn't you say?"
Emily: I should be doing some radiant damage.
"Brennan: Are you, you're less than half?"
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Oh wow! Fuck!
"Emily: Okay, so I'm gonna first thing will be—"
Ally: What does crit do? Damage and a half?
"Murph: All the roll, doubles every die."
"Ally: Oh doubles, that's—"
Siobhan: You would roll double the amount of dice.
Ally: That's so sick.
"Emily: 16 plus, so it was 21 for my first hit."
Brennan: [whispering] Jesus.
Emily: I'm going again. I'm guessing a 13 does not hit?
"Brennan: No, it does not."
Emily: Okay. Going again. That does not hit. Going again! Does a 20 hit?
Brennan: A 20 does hit.
Emily: Okay. So I hit him for another 12.
"Brennan: Woo! You leap up, he has just like, broken Kugrash's windpipe, he's come in, killed Pete, you go up and he says,"
"Robert: Miss Lee, let's not have the entire Lee family die at my request, what do you say?"
"Sophia: There's literally only one Lee that I fucking care about. Wait, no Lee. Lee's my husband. [shouts] Jesus fuckin' Christ, now I know what you're going after! Fuck you!"
"Brennan: You, [imitates multiple impacts] and you feel his fuckin' lich skull crack under your raining blows. Bdah, bdah, bdah! This guy is very powerful, but he is a spellcaster. You gotta leave a fuckin' sick crack across his skull, wailing on him, as he skids back across the balcony."
Emily: Some of that was radiant damage.
"Brennan: Absolutely, yeah. The radiant damage fucks him up for sure."
Ally: Nice.
"Brennan: That is Sofia's turn.This guy's gonna take another swing. You take 8 points of damage, Ricky. And that is going to be Pete."
"Ally: I mean, am I in Nod, what am I seeing?"
"Brennan: You float into Nod, and you hear the noise of people watching a show. And you look over, you're in a weird, red light district of Nod you haven't been at before, and you hear someone say,"
"Someone: [gravelly] Welcome to the stage, Bubbles, our next dancer!"
"Brennan: [normal voice] And you see there's a bunch of weird dream beings that all kind of look nonplussed, and like they find this distasteful. And you see a bunch of copies of your dad dressed in bubbles come out and start erotically dancing with each other on stage."
Siobhan: Oh no.
"Ally: Fuck no. I sprint as fast as I can to wherever the Golden Door was, to see what it looks like in Nod."
"Brennan: You start rushing to the Golden Door, you hear a voice behind you go,"
"Mitch Conlan: Pete, Pete!"
Pete: What?
Brennan: And you see your dad calls your name after you.
"Pete: Ahh, those, yeah, that's my name, yeah, that is who I am!"
"Brennan: You see that all of his clones run off the stage as people start going,"
"Crowd: Boo, keep dancing!"
"Brennan: And there's five of your dad just there,"
"Mitch: [heavy breathing] What's going on, what, what happened to me?"
"Pete: I may, I am magic and I had a surge, and I don't know what I did to you, but I did send you maybe to hell, I don't know."
Mitch: I don't know if it's hell. I honestly don't know if it's hell here.
"Pete: This, oh, I sent you here, that's nice. It's Nod. I think I'm dead right now, actually."
Mitch: Okay. I've figured out a lot of stuff since I've been here.
Pete: Okay.
Mitch: I had a very narrow view of what the world was.
Pete: Yeah.
Mitch: I saw a snake fuck its own asshole with its head.
"Pete: Cool, was it... consensual? [laughs]"
"Mitch: It was doing it to itself, I think it was masturbation."
Pete: I'm just—
"Mitch: My point is this, I had a very narrow minded view and… The bubbles talk to me!"
Pete: Cool.
Mitch: Do I live here forever now?
"Pete: I'm not sure, man--"
"Mitch: I think Mom and your brother and sister at some point, should know that I'm here."
"Pete: Yeah, yeah. But I'm dead too, unfortunately, I wish. What have you learned, do you know anything that could help me revive?"
"Mitch: I was wrong about my prostate. Your mother talked to me about it a lot of times, it's great."
"Pete: Yeah, that's a lot of men, they find it too late. They all say that—"
"Mitch: I missed years and years and years, it's really incredible."
"Pete: Yeah, eating ass has had a comeback, so luckily people our generation are cool with it, but there's just a lost gener-, anyway, we got, I don't, we shouldn't talk about this! Can you please help me in any way?"
Mitch: There's a panda in a full clown costume--
Ally: Can I cast Commune With City to get answers?
"Brennan: Yes. He's running after you. You just see that your dad basically has not been in hell, but has basically just been in a mind-bending phantasmagoria for the past three weeks that he's been here."
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: And has been like, you don't know if, he hasn't had a redemption. It's just that his whole mind is fuckin' unraveled, and there's hope for something? But also, you don't know if he's learned anything, he's just literally been on—"
"Ally: He totally has, he called me Pete."
"Brennan: He calls you Pete, yeah! He, you think that that is a result that something about your trip that you sent him here on means that his, the weird, horrifying, conservative things he had about what can and cannot happen, it's like, hey man. You saw a wind serpent from an ancient, long-gone religion, you know, fellate a B-list 70’s celebrity in a spinning donut going down the street. Is it really that weird to change your name? Is that really the weirdest fucking thing that you could do?"
"Ally: Great, I send my dad to Amsterdam."
[laughter]
"Brennan: He runs with you down the street, but there's about five of him as he runs. You look and see, in front of the Golden Door, that sigil in blood appearing and start to move into the position that a knob would have."
"Ally: Can I, once a day I can cast Dispel Magic, in fourth level or higher, has to make a saving roll?"
"Brennan: I'm gonna say that because this is happening in a single round of combat, your Commune With City is how you get here and find this. But you, boom, arrive there, your dad says,"
"Mitch: What am I lookin' at, Pete?"
"Pete: So, there's too much to explain. Bad guy trying to get through this door."
"Mitch: Got it, all right. Well, I can suck and fuck with the best of 'em, so—"
"Pete: Great! You, are you okay?"
Mitch: [shouting] Yes!
Pete: Okay.
"Mitch: [shouting, pained] I am doing great now!"
Pete: Let's take a breath and let's say nothing sexual for a while. Let's just take a breather!
Mitch: Cool!
Pete: Feel our body on our own.
Mitch: Yep.
Pete: Great.
"Mitch: I've done all the drugs that there are. I was wrong about that, too."
"Pete: Cool, I'm actually sober now. Yeah, great."
"Mitch: Hey, good, congrats!"
Ally: We hug. [laughs]
"Brennan: Yeah, big hug. Pats you on the back."
Ally: We hug for the first time in decades.
"Mitch: Yeah, yeah! I love, there's a lot about myself that I like that I didn't say yes to."
Pete: Yeah. Totally.
"Brennan: You see that, we snap out of the dream realm as you hug."
"Ally: [laughs] Goddamn it, what the fuck."
"Brennan: All your dad's weird dream clones as he kind of screeches and twitches. And we cut back, Kingston, it is your turn."
Lou: So is Pete dying?
"Brennan: No, no, Pete is full dead."
Lou: Pete is full dead.
Brennan: Full dead.
"Lou: Great, I cast, can I cast Revivify?"
"Brennan: You call in some very powerful magic. As Robert's surrounded and fighting, he looks down at you casting this Revivify spell, what is it, this is resurrection. What is Kingston doing this moment, you look down at Pete."
"Lou: I put both my hands on his stomach, and I say,"
"Kingston: You're not done yet, kid. Come on. We got work to do."
"Brennan: Boom! [sound of explosion] You are, whoom! Sucked out of the dream realm, back into your body."
"Pete: Ah, dad!"
[laughter]
"Kingston: What, me? I'm, you call me—"
"Pete: No, I'm sorry. I was just with my dad."
"Kingston: [laughs] Yeah, that's fine. Ooh, that's crazy. Anyway. We're still in it, Pete."
Ally: I'm hugging you.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see that, pew! As you bring the Vox Phantasma back, something broken in the magic of New York that has been broken for some time is healed forever. The dreaming and the waking intertwine and Pete is, [imitates whooshing] brought back by your magic, boom! And you know what this spell is trying to do. That's--"
"Ally: Oh, can I Mind Link with everyone and let them know what I just heard? Now we all know?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead, what are you gonna tell 'em?"
Ally: [laughs] What am I gonna tell them?
"Brennan: Your words, yeah, what do you say?"
"Ally: I'm not even quite sure what I just saw. It was like, whatever blood is happening here is happening at the door of inside Nod."
"Murph: So this is the lock, or this is the—"
"Ally: Yeah, this is probably him creating the lock here that will end up there."
Zac: We gotta find the key.
"Brennan: Kingston, do you do anything else?"
"Lou: Can I move, I'll move to, I'll stand right on the edge of the thing."
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Unless he's creating the lock and he already has the key and he is just gonna open it all in one move, yeah."
"Lou: Also, you have 1 hit point."
"Ally: Oh, really. Dope."
"Emily: Oh, we should get you healed. Anyone else have heals? You're paralyzed."
"Siobhan: I mean, I'm up on this platform and I don't know if I can do spells."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Probably not, right?"
Brennan: It gets to be Robert's turn again.
[sighs]
"Ally: Of course. I'm up, bitch!"
"Brennan: Sofia, do you have less than 150 hit points?"
Emily: I do.
[ominous music]
Siobhan: No!
"Brennan: You see Robert gets, whoom! And he goes,"
"Robert: Mean left hook, kid! Let me give it a shot! [punches her]"
"Brennan: Wham! [normal voice] And you are stunned with Power Word Stun. Automatically you can make saves at the end of your turns, but you are fully stunned."
Emily: [whispers] Oh!
"Brennan: Rowan, that is going to be your turn."
"Siobhan: So within his Globe of whatever, I can't cast spells?"
Brennan: Actually—
Siobhan: Or can I cast spells on the--
"Brennan: You're in the bubble now, so you're with—"
"Siobhan: So within the bubble, I can do it."
"Brennan: That is correct. Yeah, you are past the 10 foot barrier."
"Siobhan: Sick. Then I would like for, I would like to cast Puppet on him."
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: So it's a Constitution saving throw, and on a failed save, he has to move where I tell him to and drop what he's holding."
Brennan: Gotcha. He fails the save.
Siobhan: [whispering] Fuck yes!
Brennan: And burns into some of his interior willpower. Fwoom!
Ally: What is this?
"Siobhan: Yeah, what is this thing?"
Brennan: It's an ability in 5e called Legendary Resistance. Yep.
Zac: Fuck.
Brennan: It's not infinite. It's just very powerful.
"Siobhan: That didn't, okay. So can I cast a cantrip as a bonus action or no?"
"Brennan: Yes, as a bonus action, if you have a bonus action cantrip you can, but what else do you have?"
"Siobhan: I don't have a bonus action cantrip, fuck, fuck, fuck. And my weapon is attacking this robot over here. [sighs] Can I fuckin' punch him, there's nothing else I can do!"
"Murph: Can you throw me towards Kingston, 'cause I'm so fucked up right now."
"Emily: Oh, yeah, you’re a little paralyzed boy."
"Murph: I'm just paralyzed up there, if you could throw the bird—"
Ally: Throw a dead bird off a balcony?
"Murph: Oh actually, I'm a rat, I'm a rat again."
Lou: Throw the dead bird.
"Emily: He's not dead, he's paralyzed!"
Siobhan: I'll do that.
Brennan: Rad. You move and just huck—
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: You see that Kugrash, it's like that little thing of a little rat body goes, fling, and like, [imitates splat] lands."
Zac: That thing of like?
Siobhan: Hashtag relatable!
"Brennan: I'm trying to think about taking it, like a little, gross, mangy rat, and just a very anti-climatic, [imitates honk] as it honks and lands on the ground."
"Ally: It's like when you throw a rat, you know, that sound it makes?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, we all know—"
"Brennan: Good night, folks, I'm gonna head out!"
"Siobhan: What else, what else, what else, what else?"
"Lou: Because everyone knows that, that sound—"
"Brennan: Everyone get in the fuckin' comments, rats honk when you throw them!"
Ally: Don't @ me.
"Brennan: Rowan, yeah, you toss the rat, no sweat."
"Siobhan: And can I just take a quick look at Robert Moses and just, I would love to see what his fucking deal is, 'cause we haven't really been this close to him, face-to-face, and all of a sudden, he's green?"
"Brennan: Yeah, he's calling with some, he no, it looks like he, make whatever roll you're gonna make, make Insight or Arcana or whatever you like."
"Siobhan: Great. I'll do Insight, 16?"
"Brennan: Robert Moses purified himself, and is no longer considered undead, but is undead."
Siobhan: Oh shit.
"Brennan: He purified himself, so in other words, he has all the abilities and none of the weaknesses of undead."
Siobhan: Motherfucker.
Brennan: That's gonna be Rowan. Buh-buh-bum. Now--
"Siobhan: Oh, is the list still up there?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Siobhan: He's just thrown it on the ground, right?"
Brennan: He's tossed it on the ground.
Siobhan: I don't have enough time though to also pick up the list.
"Brennan: No, you do not."
"Siobhan: All right, well, next time."
Emily: It takes a lot to throw a rat.
Siobhan: It does.
Emily: As we all know.
"Lou: Well, exactly."
Siobhan: It’s a loud--
Lou: This constant action we're always seeing of throwing rats.
"Ally: This weekend, I threw a rat. And it, I had to sleep right after."
"Lou: I threw a rat, you know, right before we started filming this."
Brennan: Cool. That's going to be...
"Emily: This is stressing me out, I'm much less stressed now that Pete is no longer dead, but he's still at 1 hit point and it's--"
"Zac: 1 hit point, yeah."
Emily: Giving me serious anxiety.
Brennan: I'm gonna need a Constitution save from Rowan.
"Ally: Oh, I didn't Wild Magic."
Brennan: I'm gonna need a Wild Magic.
Ally: 2.
Siobhan: This isn't for my Concentration?
Brennan: But it was back to 1.
"Ally: So close, it was back to 1, so 2."
Brennan: Give me that Constitution save?
Siobhan: [drops the die] Oh fuck.
Lou: Ai chi!
Siobhan: 8.
Brennan: He reaches out and sucker punches you in the stomach and you are paralyzed. Boom!
"Robert: Take it easy, Miss Berry."
Brennan: You also take 13 points of cold damage
"Siobhan: Okay, I have a question. Since I'm a War Caster, can I still cast..."
"Brennan: Can you hold on to your concentration? Well, give me another Constitution 'cause he just did damage to you, so you take 13 points of cold damage."
"Siobhan: Okay. Hang on. And then this is for my concentration, I got an 18. Or, 20."
"Brennan: Cool, great."
"Murph: Oh, can we keep concentrating when we're paralyzed?"
"Brennan: I actually believe that we, yeah, you can."
"Murph: Okay, 'cause I had my fire elemental go, but if you don't mind, can I roll to keep him?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Murph: Okay, cool. I got two 2s."
Brennan: You do not keep him.
Lou: My man.
Siobhan: But—
"Murph, drinking from his water bottle, gives a peace sign salute to Lou. Lou laughs."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Two gang!
Brennan: You are paralyzed.
Murph: So I can't talk or anything?
"Brennan: No, you are fully—"
"Murph: We're Mind Linked though, right?"
Ally: You can Mind Link.
"Murph: Yeah, I just was like, can I, 'cause I have War Caster, so I don't have to use my hands to cast spells, but if I can't talk also---"
"Brennan: Can't talk, yeah. Can't move or speak."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: That's gonna be Ricky.
[Lou laughs in a high voice]
"Emily: God, this is so tired!"
"Zac: He, okay, so I'm just going to try to kill this one and run over, because I don't feel like he'll get attacks of opportunity and sit around me."
"Sofia: You got this, Ricky! I believe in you!"
Zac: He has disadvantage 'cause there's an umbrella in his face?
"Brennan: That is correct. Rather, you have advantage, 'cause this umbrella's going, voom-voom, voom, voom-voom-voom-voom, and popping in his grill."
Lou: My God.
Zac: No way.
Ally: You still have Ox?
Zac: A 1 and a 2?
Lou: Another 1 on the first—
Zac: Jesus Christ.
Murph: You have luck points?
"Zac: Yeah, I'm gonna use a luck point on that."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Do I get to roll two again, or just—"
"Brennan: No, just one."
"Zac: Okay. Okay, does 17 hit?"
Brennan: 17 hits.
Emily: Woo!
Zac: So I'll Divine Smite him. I'll do a second level Divine Smite on him.
"Brennan: Cool, so that's gonna be 5d8 plus 8."
Zac: Okay. Can I have someone else's d8s?
"Emily: Oh yes. Come on, get in there, pink!"
"Zac: 5d8s plus 8, okay. I got 'em. Okay."
"Emily: Oh my God, I got an 8. My kid got an 8."
Lou: What's my kid doing?
"Zac: I had three 8s, plus 9."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Emily: [crosstalk, quietly] Yes, I think got an 8."
"Lou: [crosstalk, quietly] Dude, I just did 3. I gotta talk to my fuckin’ kids."
"Zac: 8, 16, 24… 33 plus 8?"
Lou: About what they do when they leave my house.
[Brennan with a look of disbelief]
Ally: 41.
"Brennan: 41, Jesus Christ. Okay, yeah."
Zac: Is he still up?
"Brennan: He is still up. But you see him go, whoom! And slash his chest wide open and it burns and starts turning to ash. He looks fucked up."
"Zac: All right, I'm going to take my second swing at him."
Brennan: Cool. This one also has advantage.
Zac: That's a 28.
"Brennan: Yep, that hits."
Zac: And then I'll just do a first level Divine Smite on him.
"Brennan: Yeah, that's gonna be 4d8 plus 8."
Zac: Okay. Just…
"Lou: [quietly, to Emily] It’s, my kid didn’t do well."
"Emily: [gasps] Mine got a 1. It’s like they achieve, then they underachieve."
Lou: [crosstalk] Kids are tough.
"Zac: That is 5, 7, 8, plus 8. 16."
"Brennan stands up and mimes a massive hit, then takes the vampire’s mini off the board."
Brennan: Whoom!
Zac: Finally!
Ally: One down!
"Siobhan: Fuck, man. Our only person, I mean, now Sofia has radiant damage, but—"
Zac: And then now with—
"Emily: Yeah, but I'm also stunned."
Zac: Don't I get—
"Brennan: You have Ox's movement. Yeah, absolutely."
"Zac: Okay, so I'll use Ox's movement and run all the way--"
"Brennan: What is Ox's movement, it's like--"
Zac: He has 40.
Brennan: 40.
Zac: Plus mine.
"Brennan: So you, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45—"
Zac: Can I use a double movement with Ox?
"Brennan: Yes, you can, actually."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: So that's, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, You make it all the way here. In fact, actually, if you want to make it even closer, you can probably make it over here, 'cause diagonals are better in 5e."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: I'm gonna, if you want to be, or if you want to be over there, you can too."
"Murph: Dope, does help on saving throws. [laughs]"
"Zac: Yes. But that's only 10 feet, so I'm trying to decide if I—"
Brennan: You're hitting Kingston and Kug there.
Murph: And I'm fucking dead.
Zac: All right.
Zac: So that'd be dope.
"Lou: You're not dead, you're just paralyzed."
"Emily: Ox is probably kind of drooling a little bit, and it's getting in the blood, and it's messing it up a little bit."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Emily: Okay.
[laughter]
Zac: I...
Brennan: Just tell me where you're moving. Do you move there or there?
Zac: I think right there.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Will be good.
"Brennan: Cool, 'cause you took your attacks, so you're gravy."
Zac: All right.
"Brennan: You rush up, boom. That's Ricky. You see that again, Robert Moses with everyone paralyzed and stunned on the dais with him goes,"
Robert: I hold the key to the city!
"Brennan: Whoom! Takes the key out, clatters to the ground."
Emily: [whispering] Fucker!
[bass thud]
Brennan: And the objects go.
"Siobhan: Oh, the objects, that's me."
Brennan: Yep!
"Siobhan: What, who? How far does his Globe of whatevers extend?"
Brennan: 10 feet.
Siobhan: Okay.
Zac: Could I have taken the umbrella with me?
"Brennan: Just grabbed it? Attack, attack, move, move, move. You didn't use a bonus action, I'll say bonus action you grab the umbrella."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Emily: Oh my God, I'm just picturing you twirling your umbrella on your dalmatian!"
"Siobhan: So cute. So I would like to have, the one that's far away, I would just like to do a dash action."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: So it's as close to everybody as possible.
"Brennan: So it's five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30… 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60."
Siobhan: Great. Can the kiosk pick Ricky up? It's right next to him.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Siobhan: And throw him up on that balcony?
"Brennan: Give me a, I'm gonna say that's a DC20 Athletics check."
Siobhan: Great.
Lou: Fuckin' part of a kiosk?
"Siobhan: Athletics is Strength, right?"
Brennan: That's correct.
"Siobhan: So I have 14 Strength, that's pretty good."
"Brennan: So you're gonna need a plus 2, so you're gonna need an 18 or higher to get him up there. I'll say on a 15 or higher, Ricky can grab the bottom ledge."
"Siobhan: Okay, great. And do I get extra on, this isn't a saving throw."
Brennan: No.
Siobhan: Okay. So I just need to get—
Emily: 15 or higher.
"Siobhan: That's an 11. So 11 plus 2, so 13."
"Brennan: This thing, whoom, grabs Ricky. Huh! Hucks him. And he, boom."
"Siobhan: Oh no, I want to pick him up and take him over there. I don't want to throw him."
"Brennan: Oh, gotcha! Okay, so in that, it's not throwing him."
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Oh, in that case there's—"
Siobhan: Just carrying him like some kind of beautiful divan.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see it just actually just lifts him up."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Up so that he's like--
"Siobhan: So give him, to give him a step up."
"Brennan: Yep, there you go."
Siobhan: To there.
"Brennan: Boom, that's, there's no roll necessary."
Siobhan: Great.
Lou: Still would've been cool.
Brennan: It still would have been cool.
"Emily: Is he still, is Kug still on his range for saving throws?"
Brennan: Nope.
"Emily: Okay, well, what do you know."
Siobhan: Sorry.
Emily: Sacrifices.
Brennan: Unless you—
Emily: It's good.
Lou: Sacrifices are important.
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: And then, can I also have it smash against the balcony, or is that too many things?"
Brennan: That's too many things.
Zac: Can you just do that and leave me on the ground? And that way I can just kip up the thing?
Siobhan: Are you sure?
Zac: I'm pretty sure I can do that.
"Siobhan: Okay, great."
"Brennan: Yeah, so Ricky, you don't have to go if you don't want to."
Zac: I stay—
Siobhan: He can stay next to Kug.
[Emily laughs]
"Lou: He's just like, Ricky!"
"Zac: I mean, it looks like steps, right?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, that's true."
"Lou: Please, Ricky? Please get on me."
Brennan: Awesome. So that—
"Siobhan: Okay, so I'll do an attack roll, then, against the balcony."
"Brennan: Against the balcony, or against one of these? Or yeah, balcony's fine."
Emily: Aren’t you paralyzed?
"Siobhan: Yeah, no, it's the machine, it's the Animate Objects."
Emily: Oh.
Brennan: Go ahead and make an attack roll against the balcony.
"Emily: I like this. Yeah, little machine, fuck him up!"
Siobhan: 16.
"Brennan: 16 hits, go ahead and roll damage."
Siobhan: Great.
Lou: It hits that fuckin' balcony.
[laughter]
"Emily: Yeah, fuck that balcony, that's not wearing plate armor!"
Ally: It's a DC24 balcony.
Lou: Yeah.
"Emily: Huh, Moses? Should have gotten plate armor for your fuckin' balcony."
Siobhan: That's 13 damage to the balcony.
"Brennan: Whoom! You see Robert Moses wobbles a little bit as this thing cracks into the stone balcony. Balcony's looking pretty structurally sound, it's a huge, stone balcony. But it's, some cracks appear in it."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Awesome, that's the objects. Kugrash, we're at you, you are paralyzed. That means you cannot take actions. But at the end of your turn, you may roll another saving throw."
"Murph: Okay, is this Con?"
Brennan: This is a...
Lou: This is become—
Brennan: This is a Constitution saving throw.
Lou: To become unparalyzed?
Zac: You add 4 to it.
"Brennan: So you've, your turn, you cannot move or speak. Paralyzed usually is incapacitated, can't move or speak."
Murph: This is at the end of my turn.
Brennan: This is at the end of your turn.
"Murph: [sighs] All right. I only have a plus 1 on Constitution, so it's a tough one. [rolls, slams the table] Nat fucking 1."
[Brennan sighs]
"Brennan: You, [imitates choking] twitch on the ground, necromantic magic seizing you. That's gonna be the vampires."
Siobhan: Oh shit.
"Lou: Mm, that's gonna be the vampires."
"[tense, dark music]"
"Ally: We're just mad at this point, we're like, fuck you."
Brennan: This one's going to make… Cool. This one's going to grab Sofia.
Emily: So I'm stunned and grappled?
Brennan: Yep.
Emily: Life is good.
"Siobhan: Oh my God, well guys, it's been good knowing you. This has been fun."
Lou: Hey.
"Emily: Dale, I’m comin’."
Siobhan: 14 episodes.
"Brennan: This one actually, hold on."
Lou: It explodes? [laughs]
"Siobhan: Yeah, if like—"
Lou: Is that exactly what you were rolling for?
Emily: It’s a Wild Magic sorcerer and he uh--
Brennan: Now this one grabs Rowan.
Emily: He just wants to keep us away from him.
"Brennan: This one goes to the ground here. And is going to take a swing at Ricky. Hits, Ricky, you're grappled."
[Lou mumbles]
"Zac: So I'm just grappled, no damage?"
"Brennan: You are just grappled, no damage."
Zac: [whispers] Fuck you!
"Brennan: Buh-buh-bum. That's going to be, that's all the vampires that there are, so it's gonna be Sofia."
"Emily: Okay, so I'm stunned and I'm grappled."
[laughter]
Brennan: That's correct.
"Emily: You know, I guess I'm just going to have a think, you know, while I have this down time. So—"
"Brennan: At the end of your turn, you may make a—"
Emily: A roll to try and get unstunned.
"Brennan: Yes, that's correct."
Emily: Okay.
Siobhan: Jesus.
"Emily: So we just gotta fast forward to that. Okay, cool. [clears throat] What am I doing, Con save? [sighs] 11."
Brennan: [imitates choking] You remain frozen. At the end of your turn--
Ally: Did you have Bardic?
Emily: I already used it.
Ally: Ahh.
"Brennan: At the end of your turn. One of them is going to hit you for… 1, 2, for 10 damage. Your HP max is reduced by 7. As it drinks your blood."
"Siobhan: [whispering] Fuck, man. [normal voice] There's no way that we can do this."
"Brennan: Rowan, you are hit for your HP max is reduced by 10. 1, 2..."
"Siobhan: [to Brennan] Are you enjoying this, are you having fun? Are you having a good time?"
Lou: It is so wild to feel the energy that is normally at this table—
"Brennan, grinning, sticks his tongue out."
Ally: Mm-hmm.
Lou: Put that tongue back in your fuckin' mouth.
Brennan wiggles both his eyebrows and his tongue.
Emily: You're a vampire!
Ally: Put that tongue deep in your mouth!
Siobhan: Dog killing motherfucker.
"Emily: He's being a vampire, he's taking our powers."
"Lou: Put it the other way in your, take that tongue—"
"Brennan: Ricky, this one goes to bite you, it does not successfully bite you."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: That's gonna be Pete, that's your turn."
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: You're prone, you can spend half your movement to stand up."
"Ally: Oh, sorry, I already put myself up."
"Brennan: So yeah, half your movement's standing up."
"Ally: That's fine, can I roll an Arcana check to see what would happen if I cast Dispel Magic in Nod at the door on the other side?"
"Brennan: Give me an Arcana check, go ahead and roll with advantage."
"Ally: Yeah, that's great. A 22."
"Brennan: You can't hit Nod from here unless you get to Nod, but as you're looking, you're like, tingling with your Dispel Magic, you realize that nothing, no spell can bypass the Globe of Invulnerability unless it's higher than fifth level. However, a spell can reach the Globe itself. So there is a potential to dispel that Globe of Invulnerability."
"Ally: Got it. I could get to Nod if I Blinked, but that would be a lot of turns."
"Brennan: That would be a lot of turns, and there would be a chance that it wouldn't happen."
"Ally: Great, then I am going to use half my movement to get up, and then the second half of my movement to duck behind here."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: And cast Dispel Magic on the Globe.
"Brennan: Fuck yeah, let's see this. This is gonna be Box of Doom, 100 percent."
"Ally: Level 3 or lower, I cast it, but 4 and up it's a roll."
"Brennan: This is definitely above that, this is a, let me see, one, two, three, four, five, this is a sixth level spell."
"Ally: I'm absolutely gonna do Bend Luck. Cast another sorcery, a couple sorcery points."
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah, this is sixth level. Where is Dispel Magic? Hold on."
"Emily: You know, when I die in this fight,"
"Lou, on hearing that, groans nervously and shakes his head."
Emily: I'm gonna always fondly remember that I finally got to use Tipsy Sway.
Ally: [singing] Aww!
"Siobhan: You guys, it’s been really fun."
"Lou: Oh, come on, everybody! [laughs] We can do this!"
Siobhan: I'm just glad that I got to have—
Lou: Read your cards! [laughs] Read them again!
"Emily: I have been going over all my cards and being like, there's gotta be something! I can't get stunned, can I?"
"Ally: Yeah, this Dispel Magic is on my Plugs Med bracelet."
"Brennan: Ooh, awesome, that's right! So this is gonna be, it's a DC16, we're gonna get the Box of Doom out."
Murph: [whispers] Fuck.
Ally: Am I gonna roll—
Brennan: So it's just plus—
Ally: Bend Luck?
"Brennan: So you're gonna roll Bend Luck, go ahead and roll Bend Luck in the box first."
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: 1.
Murph: [whispers] Fuck.
Ally: Fuck! [laughs]
Lou: Hey.
Ally: I hate these dice!
Lou: Nat 20s exist.
"Brennan: So now, the difficulty is 15. You have a plus 5 to your Charisma bonus, which is what you're rolling to dispel, let me double check that."
"Zac: Are you near me? Oh, nevermind. It doesn't matter."
Brennan: You need to roll a 10 or higher.
Ally: M’kay.
Lou: That's very doable.
Brennan and Ally: 17!
[cheering]
Ally: Fuck yeah!
"Brennan: Pete, you raise up from death, You see that—"
Ally: Gemini dice. [kisses their d20]
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: You see that Robert looks down at you and says,"
Emily: Gemini season.
Brennan: Robert suddenly says
Robert: I thought I fuckin' killed you.
"Pete: You didn't, bitch."
[laughter]
Brennan: Boom!
Ally: As I'm hiding. [peeks out from behind cover]
Brennan: The Globe is fucking gone.
[sound of shattering glass]
Ally: Good!
"Siobhan: I'm so paralyzed, but so impressed."
Ally: Yeah.
Siobhan: And I hope that you can see it in my eyes.
"Emily: I'm both stunned and grappled and I'm impressed. Oh, but you don't want to fuck me."
Brennan: Roll for Wild Magic.
"Ally: Oh, right. 3, I keep being one above when it would trigger."
"Brennan: One above what it would trigger, exactly."
Ally: [whispering] Goddamn.
Brennan: Incredible. That's going to—
"Siobhan: Wait, does Pete still have the radiance from the previous..."
"Brennan: Oh, the radiance? No, him dying somewhat faded the glow on him. But he's back now! Kingston, that's gonna be you."
Lou: I walk over to Kugrash and I pour a bunch of Holy Grail detergent on him.
"Ally: Wait, do you, oh yeah, yeah, good."
Kingston: We gotta get Kug up.
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: What's that do?
Lou: It's a Greater Restoration.
Murph: Oh hell yes.
[Brennan imitates whirring]
Kugrash: [whispering] Fucking thank you!
"Brennan: Yes, you are fixed. That's your action, any bonus action or anything else?"
"Lou: Mm-mm, that's my, oh, a bonus? No."
"Brennan: Cool, no worries."
Murph: I have—
Lou: Oh.
"Murph: Are we getting a sense that this, that their stuff is powered by that greed, by that shit we saw in hell and stuff?"
"Brennan: Certainly, yeah."
Murph: And what happens when I eat the bagel?
"Brennan: [echoey sci-fi music begins to play] Oh, you go full, it's a full fuckin' cosmic, it's, I'll put it this way. I, as the DM, haven't invented a mechanic for what that does, because what it does is so potent."
Siobhan: [whispering] Fuck him up.
Emily: I thought that it was like killing yourself.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: It kind of, it destroys yourself."
"Lou: Also, I am gonna use—"
Brennan: Yes.
"Lou: Sorry, I am going to use a bonus action, I'm realizing that the Holy Grail detergent is not a spell, I'll cast a—"
"Murph: Oh, nice."
"Lou: Third level, I'll cast a… A fourth level Mass Healing word on errbody."
Brennan: Let's see how much that does.
"Lou: 2d4. 2, come on, dawg. 6."
Ally: Yeah.
Lou: 6 plus my spellcasting ability modifier.
Brennan: Which is 5.
Lou: Which is 5.
Ally: So 11.
Lou: Everybody takes 11 hit points.
"Ally: Wait, [whispers] ah, yeah. [normal voice] Are we, we're really close to his full thing being over."
Lou: Oh yes.
Siobhan: So we just really need—
Ally: We need to fucking attack.
"Brennan: Kingston, Robert Moses looks at you, raises his hand, hits you for 34 points of damage with a Fire Bolt."
Lou: Okay.
"Brennan: 34 points of fire damage. And then he goes,"
"Robert: I'm getting real tired of you putting people back in the fight, Vox."
Kingston: Okay.
[laughter]
"Brennan: You then, hold on one second, I gotta get some dice out."
Siobhan: Oh no!
[lots of dice rattling]
"Zac: Hey, Brennan, fuck you!"
"Emily: He's looking for the d4s, he's looking for the d4s!"
Lou: Quit it with this Reddit bullshit!
"Siobhan: Really, stick a fucking eagle statue up your ass, dude!"
Brennan winks into the camera.
Zac: I’ve figured it out! If we just kick Brennan's ass--
[laughter]
Murph: Six on one stomping.
Ally: We all just start kicking Brennan's ass!
Lou: Turn these fuckin' cameras off! [Miming to get up]
Emily: Let's just take a fuckin' DM's guide and just whap him over the head!
"Lou: I wanna cut right now, then we'll cut back and Brennan will just be covered in bruises. Robert Moses says he doesn't want to do what he wants to do."
[laughs]
"Emily: Robert Moses had a change of heart, and he's taking us all to a Yankees game."
Brennan: I need a Constitution saving throw from Kingston.
Lou: No!
Zac: Is he within 10 feet from me?
"Lou: Am I within, yes. So what happens now?"
Zac: Adding 4.
"Lou: Ooh, bah bah. [laughs] 12, plus 4, plus 7 equals more, 19... 23."
Zac: 26.
Lou: 26.
"Brennan: 26? You see he points a finger at you and says,"
Robert: Die! [imitates magical blast]
"Brennan: And this helixing spiral of ash and smoke, and you smell the stink of iron and blood and grime, it hits your chest. You would have taken 52 points of damage, instead you take 26 points of damage."
Lou: [whisper] Okay.
Brennan: How's Kingston looking?
"Lou: I was at 65 after the first, now I'm taking 26?"
Brennan: 26.
Lou: So I'll be at 39.
Brennan: Insane.
Lou: I'm really thankful for Cockrash.
[laughter]
Brennan: That's—
Siobhan: Say it again.
Lou: [singing] I'm thankful!
"Brennan: You see Robert lifts his hand up in the air after he does that and says,"
Robert: [shouting] Sinatra's Law! If you can make it here…
Brennan: And that's the end of his turn. That's going to go to Rowan. You are grappled and paralyzed.
"Siobhan: I mean, is there anything I can do?"
Brennan: Cannot take actions.
Ally: You could give a Bardic?
Siobhan: Can I give a Bardic?
"Brennan: No, I will, let me actually see. We're gonna look at--"
Zac: Paralyzed from where? [laughs]
"Siobhan: Right, at what point am I paralyzed from?"
"Brennan: Can't take actions or reactions, that doesn't say bonus actions. Hold on one second."
Emily: Oh really?
"Siobhan: In which case, I Misty Step, and..."
"Brennan: Creature automatically, I'm gonna say you can take a bonus action if you think that you could do it without speaking or moving."
Ally: Misty Step on to Robert's head. [laughs] Seriously.
Brennan: Misty Step specifically has verbal and somatic components.
"Siobhan: Oh, right."
Brennan: Or just verbal I think.
"Siobhan: Who hasn't gone yet, Ricky?"
Brennan: Ricky has not gone yet.
"Siobhan: Sick, okay. I'm going to give Bardic inspiration to Ricky."
"Brennan: You see a paralyzed Rowan looks over at you, honestly, without moving or speaking, she's just so hot!"
Zac: Awesome.
"Brennan: And you're like, I'm a fuckin' hero, my hot—"
"Siobhan: Save me, Ricky!"
"Brennan: Incredible, Rowan, we're at the end of your turn. You can make another—"
Ally: The two hottest staring at each other.
"Zac: Just like, so pure."
"Brennan: You can make another Constitution, another Constitution check."
"Siobhan: Great. This is not for my concentration, this is just a regular—"
"Brennan: Your concentration's fine for right now, this is just for the Paralyzing Touch."
"Siobhan: Great. Oh fuck. 20, not nat."
Emily: Ooh!
Brennan: You become unparalyzed.
"Siobhan: Okay, but I'm still grappled."
"Brennan: You are still grappled, that is correct, yes."
"Siobhan: Well, that I can deal with."
Brennan: Cool. Hold on.
"Siobhan: Just this body is so young and flexible and agile! [wiggles] I just do a little wiggle, just 'cause it feels good."
"Lou: [rythmically] A little wiggle, just 'cause it feels good! I said I do it!"
[Ally sings musical hits]
"Brennan: Cool, that's gonna be--"
Lou: Absolute banger in the club.
[laughter]
"Brennan: Robert looks fuckin' mad, and he, Kingston, hits you again for 10 points of fire damage. These vampires, one of them's gonna take a swing at Rowan."
Lou: I was at 99—
Brennan: Misses.
Lou: At the beginning of this turn.
"Brennan: Sorry. Yeah, misses Rowan, as you start wriggling around in his claws. Another one is gonna take a swing at Sofia. Hits, dealing Sofia 7 points of damage."
Emily: [whisper] 'Kay.
"Brennan: And then the one with Ricky is going to take a swing, hits for 5 points of damage. And that is now going to be Ricky's turn."
"Zac: Okay, Ricky is going to, well, okay. Ricky has that umbrella."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Zac: Is it obscuring the view of said vampire robot?
"Brennan: Yeah, it can still be providing you advantage on that robot."
Zac: I'm gonna shove to try to get out of it.
"Brennan: Cool, so you use one of your attacks."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: Let me know, so you're just rolling Athletics."
"Zac: Is that a, do I have advantage? That's an Athletics."
Brennan: That's an Athletics check.
"Zac: Okay, but then I, that takes one of my attacks."
"Brennan: It takes one of your attacks out, yeah."
"Zac: Okay, it's just Athletics, then? Okay. Does a 16 do it?"
Brennan: A 16—
Zac: Can I roll a lucky point?
"Brennan: Actually, I need to roll, 'cause this is not the same as an escape for the grapples, this is actually just, oh, you succeed!"
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: You, boom. You escape the grapple, and you knock it into the center of the little ritual circle here."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: Cool. That's one of your attacks, what do you do now?"
Zac: And then Ricky and Ox are gonna run up to there and try to hop up on to the--
"Brennan: Okay, give me, for both of you, a DC, I'm gonna say 15 Athletics check."
"Zac: Okay. Yeah, both of them."
Brennan: Dope.
Ally: Yeah!
"Brennan: Boom, boom."
"Ally: Oh, we've been needing this! [laughs]"
Zac: And then-- [Brennan imitates barking]
Ally:  Fucker!
"Zac: Ox is going to attack with advantage, and it's a, you know, whatever. What's it called, Blinding Light?"
"Brennan: Yes, with radiant, or yeah, Pack Tactics."
"Zac: Okay, that's a 19 plus, yeah, plus 4. So 23."
"Brennan: 23, Robert burns through a Shield spell and Ox still hits him."
"Zac: Oh, okay!"
"Emily: Ooh, yeah, waste that spell slot, you bitch!"
"Brennan: [looks into the camera] It's realistic! It's like, [Robert Moses voice] aah, dog! I fuckin' hate dogs! I hate dogs, I'm so bad!"
Siobhan: I also hate dogs.
Murph: What a bad guy.
"Zac: He does 5 damage to him, and then he has to pass a DC11 strength check to, and not be knocked prone."
"Brennan: A DC11 strength check. Hey, check it out. Rob ain't too buff. So what is it, DC11 you said?"
"Brennan: Yes. I'm gonna do Box of Doom, 'cause I think this is humiliating."
The cast taps their hands on the table in a drumroll.
Brennan: He needs an 11 or higher to save.
"Zac: [whisper] Come on, Ox!"
"Emily: Come on, everyone's rooting for the pup!"
[Zac imitates dog calling]
Zac: I'm doing that thing dog owners do.
Siobhan: I'm getting my Cutting Words.
"Brennan: 17, he saves."
"Siobhan: Wait, mm."
"Brennan: Oh sorry, oh yeah, sorry. Roll, roll, no, you can, you said you were gonna roll, so you're allowed to roll."
Siobhan: Yeah. Want to do it in the Box of Doom as well?
"Brennan: Yes. So you're going to subtract this, so that means--"
Zac: 7 or an 8?
Brennan: So you need to get a 7 or an 8.
"Siobhan: Again, it's worth a try. That's a 2. [singing] Nevermind, I tried!"
"Ally: Never mind, you tried."
Brennan: No worries.
Lou: Trying is succeeding.
Zac: And so I still have one attack.
Ally: In the book of life—
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it. Take your attack."
"Lou: In the book of life, not in the game, we're losing."
Zac: I'm gonna use a—
Emily: Very much losing!
Zac: A second level Branding Smite.
Brennan: Okay.
"Zac: I can't do that and a Divine Smite, right?"
"Brennan: You can do them both. So, but you haven't used a bonus action, so you can do Branding Smite and Divine Smite if you want."
[dramatic music cymbal rolls in]
"Zac: Okay, I'll do that."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: And that's—
"Brennan: If you got the slots for it, yeah."
"Zac: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Lou: If you got the slots—
Ally: Honey! [pretends to tilt down sunglasses]
Lou: Honey!
Emily: [campy] If you got the slots…
Siobhan: Honey!
[laughter]
"Ally: Do it, hey!"
Lou: Honey! Honey!
"Zac: Yeah, so first level Divine Smite."
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Ally: Charge it, honey."
"Lou laughs, sticking his tongue out."
"Zac: I gotta make sure I hit. A 19, so that--"
Emily: Ooh!
Zac: 19 plus… 29.
Brennan: Definite hit.
"Zac: All right, so that would be—"
Siobhan: Charge it to your Amex!
"Brennan: And he's undead, so you're gonna add your extra d8 for the Divine Smite."
"Zac: M'kay, so that's, can I have 2d8 from somebody?"
Emily: Gladly!
Lou also donates a die.
Brennan: What slot are you burning for the Divine Smite?
"Emily: [very quietly, offscreen] Let’s see how our kids do."
"Zac: For the, I have a first level spell."
"Brennan: Cool, first level spell. So that's gonna be 3d8 from Divine Smite, plus the d8 for the ax normally, so that's 4d8 plus 2d6 from Branding Smite."
Zac: Yeah.
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: Plus 8, so you're gonna roll [laughing incredulously] all those dice plus 8!"
Emily: Ooh!
"Siobhan: Fuck him up, Ricky!"
"Ally: That's right, Ricky!"
Siobhan: Fuck him up!
Zac: All right.
"Emily: Ooh, a lot of 7s."
"Zac: 8, 7, 7—"
Emily: [whispering to Lou] My kid got a 7.
"Zac: So 8, 16… 30 points plus 8."
Ally: 38.
Siobhan: Fuck yes.
"Brennan: You and your dog bound, Ox goes,"
"Ox: Wow, Ricky, we're doing it! We're real heroes!"
Ricky: [weakly] I hope we are! [laughs]
"Brennan: And then you see that, you said 38, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: And then you see that your ax says,"
"Ax: Sire, I hunger for this one! Let the light of justice be done to him!"
"Brennan: You go up, wah, boom! [sound of explosion] And Robert's ribcage scatters out of his suit."
Murph: Jesus.
Brennan: [imitating explosion] He stands. [gasps] The wind kicks up.
"Robert: [pointing to Ricky] That's a $12,000 suit, asshole."
Ally: That would be what he says.
Ricky: That's too expensive for a suit.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see, he looks furious, and, but he is badly, badly hurt."
"Zac: And his Shield's gone now, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, he used his Shield."
Ally: That was his reaction.
Zac: Yeah.
"Siobhan: So he can't use a reaction again, right?"
Brennan: Can't use a reaction again.
"Zac: I mean, his, that orb."
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, the Orb of—"
"Brennan: The Orb is, yeah."
Ally: That's been gone.
"Brennan: The orb is gone, his Shield didn't do shit, and he used his reaction to cast that Shield spell."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: It is objects' round.
"Siobhan: Great. So since the umbrella is up there, the umbrella is gonna attack."
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
"Siobhan: Which is… 20, not nat."
Brennan: 20 hits.
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: No, he used Shield, it does not hit, sorry. It stays for his whole turn."
Siobhan: Really?
Ally: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: Yeah, Shield stays for his whole turn, yeah."
"Siobhan: Okay. And then the kiosks can't get to him, right?"
"Brennan: They can move, 'cause these, the vampires clambered up on them, so your kiosks can hang on the side and go over and take swings."
"Siobhan: Okay, yeah. I'll… I'll give that a go, why not?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it!"
Siobhan: Do I have to do Athletics checks for them or something?
"Brennan: No, they're just gonna use their movement for this one."
"Siobhan: Okay, great."
"Brennan: But yeah, just go ahead and make your attack roll."
Siobhan: Great. And the other one as well.
Brennan: Dope. [imitating mechanical whirring] These kiosks come over here.
Ally: Sick.
"Brennan: Five, yeah, these animated kiosks are so fun."
[Murph laughs]
"Brennan: Insane. Cool, they make swings."
"Siobhan: Great. Oh, that is gonna hit. Oh, I think. So that's a 21 and a 23."
Brennan: The 23 does hit.
Ally: Ooh!
"Murph: Oh right, fuck the Shield."
"Siobhan: Nice. So that's, 13, 14, 15."
Brennan: 15 damage.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Gee, yeah, he's looking fucked up."
"Siobhan: Man, he's still fucking—"
"Ally: You know, distracted or—"
"Brennan: At the end of your turn, he looks at you, Ricky. He's gonna take a swing, he hits. I'm gonna need a Constitution saving throw from you."
Zac: Okay.
"Emily: Oh, but you're powerful."
"Zac: Constitution, so..."
Emily: So you get to add 4 to yours?
Zac: I had 20.
Brennan: 20?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: You succeed, you are not paralyzed, but you do take… 11 points of cold damage."
[somber music]
"Brennan: As he, boom, wallops you with one of his fists, and then he concludes his statement."
Siobhan: Oh no.
"Robert: [quietly] If you can make it here, [roaring] you can make it anywhere!"
[imitates explosion]
"Brennan: He holds up what looks like a golden gnomish lock, the circle, whoom, glows with red light. [imitates magical blasts]"
Lou: Is that guy in the center of it dying?
Brennan begins to change the signs on the stock exchange. He accidentally pops the wall out of position.
Brennan: Oop.
Emily: You already replaced that one.
"Brennan: [whispering] Sorry. Oh, magnets."
Siobhan: [whispering] You fucking idiot.
"Ally: This'll be an insert, this'll just be an insert, we all know that!"
"Siobhan: [mocking] The runes are upside down, you idiot!"
"Brennan: I know, I'm bad."
Siobhan: Wow.
Ally: [valley-girl accent] I'm bad.
Brennan: Honestly?
"Zac: I’m probably around an idiot a lot but I, uh, I think you're doing a great job."
"Brennan: Hey! Thanks, Zac, I appreciate it."
Lou: [whispers] I don't!
[laughter]
[Brennan imitates explosions]
"Brennan: The lock shoots into the center of the, just past that vampire. Vwoom. Disappears into Nod, you see Nod. And the, whoom. Key, the spectral image of the key to the city shoots into the lock in the Golden Door in Nod, [sound of metal clanging] and the door, [imitates explosion] opens. Golden light spreads, boom, everywhere, and you see Nod, the buildings of Nod begin to buckle and snap as though hurricane force winds were rending the sixth borough apart, and the portal to dream, [sound of slamming door] closes. Robert starts laughing."
[menacing laughs]
Brennan: That's going to be Kugrash.
Murph: So the ritual's complete?
Brennan: The ritual is complete.
"Zac: The door's open, but he hasn't gone through the door yet, right?"
"Brennan: Well, all of these have happened, and the, it looks like whatever he was trying to do to Nod has occurred, you saw the Golden Door open through the portal into the realm of Nod for the split second that smoke and, [imitates whooshing] appeared, and you saw that indeed, as he held up this lock here, a lock was created on the other side in the door."
"Murph: All right. Well, I don't think there's any kind of funky stuff I could pull with the bagel now. I'm just gonna try to do damage to him."
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: I guess so.
Murph: You guys think the bagel idea could work?
"Lou: I don't, I mean, I don't fully understand what the bagel does."
Murph: I think I was told—
"Ally: It would kill you, though."
Murph: It makes you part of New York.
"Lou: So you, I mean. [laughs]"
Zac: He told us that he doesn't know what it does. [laughs]
"Emily: It sounded like-- Well, he said that--"
"Brennan: The bagel's so powerful that even I, as a mortal, can't, me, Brennan, I can't tell you what the Bagel of All Things does."
Ally: I have a possible funky idea too.
Murph: All right. Then I'm going to use… I'm gonna use Wall of Fire.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: And I'm going to set it up in such a way that it is not, starting at him, and then going through here."
Brennan: Okay. So just right on top of him--
"Murph: Yeah, so that it doesn't hit my friends here."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: How long, it is… It's, oh, it's up to 60 feet long."
"Brennan: Yeah, you don't have to make it a full 60."
"Murph: So I'm just gonna make it over those guys, so 10 feet, whatever the hell it is."
"Brennan: Cool, dope. Hell yeah. Go ahead and give me that damage."
Ally: What do you need?
"Siobhan: Man, we've gotten so much use out of these little fire things."
Murph: I need five.
Lou: The gift that keeps on—
Ally: How many?
Murph: 5d8s.
"Ally: Oh, sick."
"Siobhan: Oh, d8."
Lou: [handing a die over] Take my son.
Emily: D8?
Lou: Let my son do well.
Emily: Take my daughter.
Lou: [laughs] Take my daughter.
"Murph: I think I'm, I got 5, perfect."
Emily: You got it? Okay. [takes back her die]
"Lou: [talking behind his hand to Emily] Okay, here we go, let’s see, let’s see."
"Emily: 'Cause she, you know. She usually gives 7s."
Murph: And then they make Dex saving throws.
"Lou: I wanted him to get out there. My d6 sons are kind of trash, my d8 son, fuck, my guy got a 2!"
"Emily: A 2? Oh my God, what are you feeding them at home?"
"Lou: I don't know, juice?"
Murph: 18?
"Emily: That's your problem, you gotta feed them oatmeal."
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: You do 18 damage.
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: Hold on a second.
Lou: I guess my kid is never leaving the house again.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Okay… And then that one is, buh-buh-buh-bum. [imitates roaring flames] The wall horribly burns them. Which way is the wall facing, by the way?"
Murph: The wall is facing—
Zac: Can you block him from that?
"Murph: I guess it's facing in, so that it doesn't hurt Kingston."
"Brennan: Cool. It faces this way, this one's gotta roll a Dex save, and it takes half that much on a success."
Siobhan: That's fine.
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: Not the kiosk!
"Brennan: You figure that out, the kiosk is there. That's your concentration. Your fire elemental's already gone."
"Siobhan: It's gone, it's, I rolled a 3."
"Brennan: Oh. How much, how many hit points?"
Siobhan: So it takes damage.
Brennan: It takes 18 points of damage.
"Siobhan: Oh, that's fine. So it's at 38, ah."
"Brennan: Make sure it does, yeah, track their hit points as well as your own, yeah."
Murph: And then I'm gonna back up so that I'm not in everybody's line of sight here.
Brennan: Cool. That's Kugrash. Then it's the vampires.
Lou: I don't like when the vampires go.
"Ally: Me either. Oh, which time? The six times that they go per round?"
"Brennan: It's 9, 18, your AC is 19, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: This one can't bite you, even though you're paralyzed."
"Emily: Awesome! Then Tipsy Sway, right?"
Brennan: Oh shit!
Emily: Can I do a reaction like that?
"Brennan: Yeah, I think you can, actually."
Emily: Can I spend a ki point to make him attack his neighbor?
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: You can. He hits! You see that he goes to bite you, and touches your leg, even though you're paralyzed, it triggers some nerve in your leg, and you kick him in the head, and he, [sound of whooshing] wigs out and smacks that dude, for… A bunch of damage."
Emily: Yeah! Fuck each other up!
"Brennan: Insane. And then this one's going to attack Rowan, hit. And Rowan, it's going to deal you 18 points of damage… Your HP max is reduced by 13."
"Siobhan: Fuck, okay."
"Brennan: Vampire here is going to go and move out of the Wall of Fire over here, that kiosk can get a swing on it."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: And it's going to go for…
Siobhan: Does 21 hit?
Brennan: It sure does.
"Ally: Yeah, stop it! If it gets attack, then it..."
"Brennan: No, that's only Ricky that has the Sentinel ability. You can go ahead and roll damage."
Siobhan: 15.
Brennan: 15 damage?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: Oh, that's Sentinel that stops it. Okay. [mutters quietly]"
"Brennan: Whap! This thing runs over here, makes an attack. Grapples Ricky. Let me see if it was there, it goes five, ten, 15, 20, yeah. So Ricky, you are grappled by this thing. That is going to be… That's them, Sofia, that's back to you."
"Emily: Okay. So I'm stunned, what does stunned mean, precisely? Is it, essentially I can't do anything, I just have to roll?"
Brennan: You've gotta roll that Con save.
"Emily: Okay. But, involuntary actions, maybe I could just at least piss it?"
[laughter]
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely!"
"Emily: [laughter] Okay, I do do that. And then… Does a 16 save?"
Brennan: What's that?
"Lou: I'm just, I'm crossing my fingers."
Brennan: 16 does not save.
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: Vampires are gonna go.
Lou: Again?
"Brennan: Yep, legendary action. This one's gonna bring Ricky away."
Lou: So soon!
Brennan: Move you over facing this way. This one's going to attack Sofia. Hits.
"Siobhan: You mean, Rowan?"
"Brennan: Oh, no, no. Sofia."
Siobhan: Oh. My one is attacking Sofia?
"Brennan: No, no, sorry. This one is attacking Sofia. Sofia, you take another 14 points of damage. Your HP max is reduced by 11. [whispering] That's one, two, three. [normal voice] And then, one of them's gonna make an attack on Rowan, hits."
Siobhan: And I'm gonna do my last Cutting Words on that roll.
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: Does anyone have any spells that unparalyze someone or anything?
"Lou: I do, but I'd have to touch you."
"Zac: Yeah, same."
Brennan: No. Still gonna hit you.
"Siobhan: All right. Well, I wasted so many things this--"
"Brennan: You take 8 points of damage, your HP max is reduced by 7."
Siobhan: Okay. [sighs]
Brennan: That's their round.
Siobhan: We were feeling so buff at the beginning of this day.
"Brennan: Pete, that's you, baby."
Ally: Okay. Can I do Insight to see how fucked up Bob is?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Ally: Great, 8."
"Brennan: He, it's hard to tell 'cause he's laughing so hard."
Lou: Can I Mind Link with Pete real quick?
"Kingston: Pete, you want to do something crazy?"
Pete: Mm-hmm?
"Kingston: You want to shoot spells at the same time at Robert Moses, and see what happens?"
"Ally: Yes, okay, wait, I have a question."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: In an earlier episode, Alejandro, and I gave him the juul, said if I say his name three times, he would appear no matter what? That was a promise that he gave me?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
Ally: Could I blink to get to the other door in Nod and call Alejandro and start working on this from the other side?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can absolutely do that if you'd like."
"Kingston: Do your thing, do your thing."
"Pete: I like your idea too, but then maybe we can get another actor in on this, we can start shooting stuff back."
"Brennan: Cool. I want you to, so you say Alejandro's name three times."
"Ally: No, no, I blink first, and then I call Alejandro to—"
"Brennan: Okay, go ahead, you cast Blink, go ahead and give me your roll, so that's your action."
Ally: Uh-huh.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me your roll for Blink to see if you go to Nod or not.
"Ally: Okay, it's 11 or higher. No! [laughs] It's 4! Wait! Tides of Chaos!"
"Brennan: Gives you advantage, right?"
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: So you can roll, that's a d20 roll, yeah."
Ally: Okay. No! The same 4!
"Zac: You can still call him, right?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, still call Alejandro."
"Ally: Yeah, Alejandro, Alejandro, Alejandro."
"Brennan: Cool. Go ahead and give me an initiative roll, if you'd be so kind."
"Ally: Fucker, it's 3. Great. Oh my God."
Siobhan: That means he'll go soon.
Zac: He'll go in a few—
Ally: That's true. What the fuck is happening!
Emily: That is so—
Siobhan: You're rolling so badly today.
Ally: Truly.
"Brennan: Give me a Wild Magic roll, Pete!"
"Ally: All right. 11, Cool. There's the 11 I needed for Blink."
"Brennan: Cool. That's going to now be, this is one of those fights, I tell ya."
Ally: It's just one of those days...
"Brennan: That's going to now be Kingston, that's you."
Ally: There's Limp Bizkit.
Lou: Is Sofia's paralysis magical in any way?
Brennan: It is magical.
Lou: Can I cast Dispel Magic?
Brennan: You absolutely can.
[Emily gasps]
"Brennan: It is a powerful stunning magic, so Dispel, I just want to make sure that I understand here real quick, because, let me look at, I just want to make sure that you are operating with the most information possible."
Lou: Thank you so much.
"Brennan: You said I'm a bad DM, but the thing is that I'm not, I'm actually—"
Lou: I never said you were a bad DM!
"Siobhan: No, we're saying you're a bad person. It’s nothing about your DMing ability."
"Brennan: Yes, no, I'm sorry, I didn't, that actually—"
Murph: We don't like you personally.
"Brennan: Yes, yes yes yes, for sure."
Siobhan: Truly a human-to-human.
Ally: But DM? Wow. Amazing.
Emily: It’s about you as a person not you professionally.
"Brennan: I want to also point out that, if you have a slot to cast Dispel Magic, Lesser Restoration is touch."
Lou: Yes.
"Brennan: But in other words, so I don't, yeah, I don't think you can--"
Lou: I'd have to get all up in the business of the mech and the--
"Brennan: Cool, so it is a, so go ahead, we're gonna do a Box of Doom roll again."
"Emily: What would it be, 'cause maybe you might not want to be."
"Lou: Yeah, what would it be?"
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Arcana check.
Lou: Okay. Okay. It's gonna be 11.
"Brennan: The odds would be against you, but it wouldn't be impossible."
Lou: You're worth it. Let's play.
Emily: Oh! [laughs]
"Brennan: Cool, Box of Doom."
"Emily: Oh my God, thank you so much!"
"Lou: I use Bardic Inspiration, or the Bardic Inspiration I have left."
"Ally: Oh yeah, goddamn."
Brennan: Holy shit!
Siobhan: Don't use it unless you need to.
"Ally: Did Alejandro show up, or that's more when his roll comes up?"
"Brennan: That's when his roll comes up, you say his name three times, then Kingston, this is an eighth level spell you're attempting to dispel. You are adding your Wisdom modifier to this."
Lou: Great.
"Brennan: You need to beat an 18, you're adding a plus 5 to the roll. Let's roll the d8 first, if you're using Bardic."
"Lou: The d8, okay."
"Brennan: Or actually no, 'cause you don't, yeah--"
Siobhan: You don't have to use it until you need to.
Brennan: Let's see how we do here.
"Lou rolls a natural 18, then sits down with a thumbs up."
Emily: Oh!
Ally: What is it?
Zac: 18?
Brennan: 18!
Ally: Hey!
"[applause, cheering]"
"Siobhan: Hell yeah, coming through when it counts!"
"Brennan: Kingston, in this den of fucking wickedness, all of the power and might bent on sapping blood and strength and wealth and hope from the people of New York, you have been nothing but a tide of light rolling in here, fucking Dispel, Revivify, gone, bah, bah, bah! And you, whoom, remove the paralysis."
"Emily: Oh, stunning."
Brennan: Remove the stunning from Sofia Lee. That is your action.
Sophia: Oh!
Lou: And then I'd like to move.
"Sophia: Oh, Kingston, thank you!"
"Lou: Oh yeah, I'm gonna, I have to move, I want to move back here with Pete and Kugrash."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You duck back, [imitates whooshing], okay. [whispering] 1.... Rowan, you take 7 points of damage. Sofia, you take 5 points of damage from them just slamming you with their giant metal arms. [imitates impacts] Ricky—"
"Rowan: Boys, boys!"
"Brennan: You take 18 points of damage, your HP max is reduced by 12. That is, [imitates blasts]. Bada-boom. That's going to be our pal Robert. Kingston, I'm gonna need a Constitution saving throw from you."
"Lou: Okay. I'm not, I can't hide? [laughs] I can't hide."
Siobhan: Ready or not. Here I come.
"Brennan: Actually, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm wrong, you're more than 30 feet away. He's gonna hit Ricky with this."
Lou: Phew!
Brennan: Or actually--
Zac: What do you need from me?
"Brennan: Actually sorry. Ox is still there attacking him, right?"
Zac: Yes.
"Ally: He would have seen it, okay? He would have maybe seen it."
Brennan: You see he goes--
Zac: I think it's—
"Brennan: He goes,"
Robert: Oh pal. Is this your dalmatian here?
"Rick: [shakey] Yeah, why?"
Brennan: Skrah! And rips its head off its body.
"Emily: [dismissively] Eh, it just turns back into light."
Brennan makes a high-pitched ‘ping’ noise as Ox dissolves.
Zac: I'm still crying.
[laughter]
Murph: It was a horrifying—
"Lou: Between that windpipe and the ripping of a dog's head, this is, well—"
"Rowan: I think he might the bad guy, I think he's not a great dude—"
Robert: [screaming] I'm bad!
"Rowan: I don't know, I'm still— I’m not sold."
Pete: I'm not sure. I'm starting to think he might not be good.
Zac: Is he taking fire damage on this turn?
"Brennan: Yeah, he actually moves out of here."
Murph: Gotta wait 'til the end of his turn!
"Brennan: He gotta wait 'til the end of his turn, so he gets out of the Wall of Fire."
[laughter]
"Zac: I thought in his turn, he would just get--"
"Murph: That was gonna be a real ""Um, actually, at the end of your turn, you didn't move over—”"
Lou: And you guys can watch Um Actually on Dropout.
"Murph: Yeah guys, check it out."
Lou: New episodes every Thursday.
Ally: New seasons now.
Murph: Get Dropout.tv.
Siobhan: Just a table full of champions.
"Ally: Oh yeah, we've all been on it."
"Lou: No, I have not."
Siobhan: What? Outrageous.
"Emily: Oh shit. Oh, it's 'cause Trapp doesn't like you."
"Lou: Yeah, Trapp hates me."
[laughter]
"Lou: [to the camera] Fun fact, Trapp hates me."
"Brennan: Rowan, that's gonna be you, you are grappled, and you are not paralyzed."
Siobhan: I am going to Misty Step the fuck out of there.
[sound of magical shimmering]
Brennan: Whoop!
"Siobhan: Next to my boy Pete. I think, is that within 30 feet of Robert Moses."
Brennan: Not within 30 feet of Robert Moses.
"Siobhan: Oh, within 60 feet of Robert Moses, though, right?"
Brennan: Let's find out.
Lou: [singing and yawning] Is it within 60 feet of Rober—
Siobhan: Is it within 60 feet?
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure."
Siobhan: Great. So I will—
Pete: Hey!
Siobhan: Cast Vicious Mockery on him as a cantrip.
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
Siobhan: It's a Wisdom saving throw.
Brennan: He succeeds.
"Siobhan: Well, good for him."
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: I'm like,"
"Pete: Hey, you dropped this Cartier watch. [opening a box and offering it to Rowan]"
Brennan: You hit that.
Rowan: You just had that on you?
Pete: It was in my backpack.
"Rowan: That's, how many children did you kill to--"
"Pete: No one died, okay?"
"Rowan: No, but like— [clears throat]"
[Pete coughs]
"Rowan: I mean, I'll take it."
Pete: Fuck yeah. [laughs]
Brennan: Hold on.
Ally: I'm doing a celebratory dance even though I have 12 health.
Zac: We're all gonna die.
Ally: I'm alive!
"Lou: [laughs] Exactly. Another paragon is in the midst of being created, but Pete is dancing."
"Pete: [singing] Sha-da-da-da-da-da, mm-mm! Goin' downtown! Hey, taxi, where do I go?"
"Ricky: Pete, what are you doing?"
Pete: What?
[Ally laughs]
Rowan: Sober Pete is much weirder than I expected.
"Kugrash: Pete, you died."
"Rowan: I thought the drugs were making him weird, but actually, it was already there."
"Brennan: Robert Moses reaches a hand out, does 35 points of fire damage to Ricky."
Zac: Okay.
[Brennan imitates explosion]
Ally: What are you—
Lou: Math in everyone's little health boxes. Mine is not.
Ally: Everyone's max health going down too.
Siobhan: It's such big numbers as well.
"Brennan: Ricky, that's you."
Zac: Okay. I'm going to shove my way out of this hold.
Brennan: Cool. You've got to beat a 16.
"Zac: Oh wait, I want to—"
"Brennan: On just an Athletics, yeah."
Zac: I'm gonna lucky point that.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Beat it.
Brennan: Fuck yeah.
"Zac: And now, I just, while flying through the air, could I jump at him? When I jump off of him?"
"Brennan: I'm gonna say, let me see. What is your Strength and, hold on a second."
Zac: My Athletics is 9.
"Brennan: And your Strength is 20, right?"
Zac: My Strength is 20.
Rowan: Wow. That's a strong boy.
Ricky: [grunting] Rah!
Pete: That's the guy I work out with!
"Brennan: I'm gonna say, I'm gonna need a DC20 Athletics check for you to just jump and grab on to, on to the ledge."
Zac: Can I also make a Perception check before I do that?
"Brennan: Yeah, sure."
Zac: 16 plus—
"Emily: You got it, kid."
Zac: 21.
"Brennan: Yeah, what are you looking for?"
Zac: I'm just trying to see how hurt is he?
"Brennan: Oh, he's extremely hurt."
"Zac: Okay. So, and I have Bardic Inspiration, I have not used that yet."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: And that's a d8?
Lou: [quietly] Yeah.
Zac: Okay. DC20.
Lou: Yeah!
Zac: Okay. That's a 13. So is there any way to get up there without doing this?
"Brennan: Oh you, is this kiosk still here from your animation, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, actually, sorry, so yes, you can kip up there. What did I say the original—"
Zac: 20.
"Brennan: I said it was 20. But you didn't, I think I said 15 before to get up there your other time. So you don't get all the way up there, you push off, you have an extra attack, but you get to like, here on the edge of the kiosk."
Zac: Can I take the attack from there?
"Brennan: With disadvantage, I'll say. As this thing tilts and rolls--"
"Zac: So this is my entire movement, right?"
Brennan: That's your entire movement to get there.
Zac: Then I'm gonna use this d8 to get up higher.
"Brennan: Okay, yeah, so you only have to beat a 15."
Zac: Okay.
[Emily sighs]
Brennan: What is it?
Zac: I have a 14.
Brennan: You have a 14.
"Zac: So with disadvantage, I'm going to--"
Ally: What is Bend Luck?
Brennan: How many times can you use Bend Luck?
Ally: It's just points.
Brennan: Really?
Ally: So I have 9 sorcery points now. Unless I'm mistaken—
Lou: Everybody out here with points.
Ally: I have a Bend Luck card.
"Emily: Yeah. Ki points, sorcery points. Pretty much that's all."
Lou: Trying to get on this point game.
Siobhan: Right? Think I might want points next time.
"Ally: Spend 2 sorcery points, yeah."
"Brennan: Yeah, cool. You can do that to—"
Ally: I can do it to a creature's roll before the effects.
"Brennan: You can use your reaction, you burn two. You get Ricky over there."
Ally: I still have a lot of sorcery points.
"Murph: Okay, Ricky's up there."
"Ally: Oh, 'cause no matter what."
"Brennan: No matter what, he only needed one more point."
"Ally: Oh, cool."
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: It was a 3.
"Zac: And what's, I mean, that umbrella's gotta be fuckin' him up, right?"
[Ally laughs]
"Brennan: The umbrella I think is still there, opening and closing in his face and fucking him up."
Ally: The umbrella's just singing.
"Siobhan: [crosstalk, singing] I’m singing in the rain!"
"Emily: Ricky, you have attacked with advantage this entire fight!"
Zac: So is that an advantage?
Brennan: That is at advantage.
Zac: All right.
Emily: Holy shit. Can we all carry umbrellas with us in the next fight?
Ally: Yeah.
Zac: 28.
Brennan: He—
"Lou: Umbrellas, key to your fight."
"Brennan: Yes, you hit on a 28."
"Zac: I realize I have one third level spell that I will use for a second level Divine Smite, does that make sense?"
"Brennan: No, you can do a third level Divine Smite."
"Zac: Oh, a third level Divine Smite. Then fuck yeah."
"Brennan: So you're gonna do, so that's gonna be 6d8 plus 8."
"Zac: Just give me all your die, please."
"Emily: I mean, this is his end, but let's see."
Lou: This is his end.
Emily: How truly...
[Ally whistles]
"Lou: Oh, my boy got a 1."
"Zac: 6, 12."
Lou: [whispering] My boy is trash today!
"Emily: [whispering] Oh, what am I… [normal voice] What did my kid get?"
"Zac: 15, 18…"
"Emily: [quietly] My kid only got a 3. I think they're tired, you know?"
Lou: I think it’s time for them to go home.
"Zac: 22, plus 8."
"Ally: Oh, that's just seven dice. Aren't you doing eight?"
"Zac: That's seven dice, oh then one more dice?"
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, 'cause a third level should be 5d8, no it should be… Smite is 2d8, for third level, that goes 3d8, 4d8, and then he's undead, so that's 5d8, 6d8 with the ax, so it should just be 6d8."
"Zac: Okay, then that was right, so it's 30 points of damage."
"Brennan: Ricky. You leap up to the balcony. Boom, boom."
[suspenseful music]
"Robert: Oh kid, I make you mad?"
Ricky: I'm pretty mad.
"Brennan: [laughs, then imitates whooshing]You see that Moses smiles, closes his eyes and says,"
Robert: I'll see you in the funny papers.
"Brennan: Whoom, and you take his fuckin' head off. [imitates hissing sound]"
Zac: That felt bad.
"Emily: Oh, he's not dead, is he?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, here is what I'm worried about. He just forgave himself of his sins, so I don't know, do you have another Revivify?"
Emily: So now he's gone to heaven or something?
"Siobhan: Yeah, maybe."
Lou: Bring him back to life.
Siobhan: Dale will deal with him.
"Ally: Oh, that growth was near heaven. Oh, nevermind, I can't--"
"Brennan: You see all the vampires start freaking the fuck out, but Ricky, that's you. The objects go, and on that turn… Buh-buh-buh-bum, buh-bum, bum."
Zac: Alejandro.
"Ally: Yay, too late. Sorry guys."
"Emily: No, don't apologize."
"Brennan: You see Alejandro goes,"
"Alejandro: Holy shit! What's, why, wha! Pete, Peter, what is going on?"
"Pete: He did the entire Sinatra's Law, and he created a lock and key and opened up a door in Nod, and then we killed him."
"Brennan: Alejandro looks around, he is going to go ahead and cast a powerful spell. Go ahead, tell me what your objects are doing, though, while I'm looking this up."
"Siobhan: Well, the one near Ricky is going to attack that vampire over there."
Brennan: Cool. Whoop!
"Lou: [whispering, rolling a die] God, this is sharp, God."
Emily: [whispering to Lou] Whose is that?
"Lou: [unintelligible, pointing to Ally]... more dice."
Siobhan: And then… The one on the other side is going to attack the one with Sofia.
Brennan: Yes.
"Siobhan: Not that. It's the one that's by the, it's up."
Brennan: Oh yes.
Siobhan: This one. And then the umbrella's also going to go after that one.
"Brennan: Gotcha. Cool. Your objects go to attack. Yeah, go ahead and roll your attacks."
"Siobhan: Ooh, well, the umbrella crit."
[Emily laughs]
Ally: This fuckin' umbrella.
Lou: It's hard to celebrate.
[laughter]
"Siobhan: And then… A 12 is the highest, the other two miss."
Lou: If only.
"Brennan: Gotcha. Buh-buh-bum. The two miss. Kugrash, that's you."
"Siobhan: Wait, do you not want me to roll my attack?"
"Brennan: Oh, did you, I thought you already rolled them."
Siobhan: No the umbrella crit. I didn’t roll damage.
"Brennan: Oh yeah, roll damage, yeah, roll damage, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Siobhan: Sorry. So it's 4d6?
"Lou: [quietly] Umbrella, ella, ella. Eh."
Emily: [whispering] Eh.
Lou: Eh.
Emily: Under.
Lou: My umbrella.
[laughter]
Siobhan: An 8. 16.
"Brennan: Ooh. You see the cockpit opens as this one tries to drain Sofia's blood. And your umbrella shoots through his eye,"
"Kiosk Vampire: [screams] Aah! Aah, aah!"
Brennan: [normal voice] screaming.
Siobhan: Horrifying.
Brenna: Horrifying—
"Rowan: Yeah, that's what it feels like to bleed!"
[laughter]
Pete: Fuck!
"Brennan: Kugrash, that's you."
Murph: I'm going to try to Polymorph the dude in the mech suit over here.
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: Funny!
Brennan: Gotcha.
Siobhan: Funny!
Brennan: Great. You're going to make a save.
Emily: Make him an umbrella!
"Siobhan: No, they'll fuck you up!"
Brennan: That vampire burns through its last point of legendary resistance.
Ally: Man!
Emily: They had so many points of legendary resistance.
Brennan: They all had 3.
Emily: Wow.
"Siobhan: Which, considering this fight has been four rounds, is a lot."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: That's going to be, you guys see that the vampires turn into gaseous mist and, [imitates rushing air] begin to flee from the cockpits. But they actually, they turn into mist. But they do not yet move. Sofia, that's gonna be you."
Emily: I fight the mist.
[laughter]
Brennan: Make some attack rolls!
"Siobhan: This is some real, fucking monk shit\--"
"Emily: I'm technically grappled right now, does this mean that I'm--"
Brennan: It doesn't give you disadvantage at all.
Emily: Okay. I'm gonna Flurry of Blows on the mist. Does a 17 hit?
Brennan: 17 hits.
[laughter]
Murph: A drunk woman kicking the air.
[Emily laughs]
Lou: This is how you know things are bad. [laughs]
"Emily: Okay, that is 8. 3 of those are radiant damage. And that's also gonna hit. Another 16, 4 of that's radiant damage. It's gonna hit again. [laughs]"
"Rowan: Sofia, are you okay?"
Sofia: I'm fine!
[laughs]
"Emily: Another 12, 3 of that's radiant. And I hit again! [laughs]"
Brennan: Incredible!
"Emily: And that's-- For another, wait. 9 points, 16."
Zac: Damn! It's so—
"Pete: Hey, where was that?"
[laughter]
Sofia: I was paralyzed the entire time!
"Brennan: You see Sofia, as Moses disappears and the other vampires flee, you see Sofia grabs a wisp of fog, and just starts pummeling it in what the head would theoretically be. And is just kicking the shit out of a wisp of steam, over in a corner of the room! [laughs]"
"Ally: Honestly, sick."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: I'm gonna say that you successfully pummel this vampire to death as you, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bah-bah-bah, as your radiant claws."
Emily: Sobbing and I never stop.
"Siobhan: That's the one that fucked up Liz, so."
"Lou: Liz, so."
Kingston: Thank you. You’ve done me a great service.
"Sofia: Oh, okay!"
Kingston: Glad you didn’t let that one get away.
"Brennan: You, yeah, pummel that vampire to death. The other two vampires, wah, misty escape, and you guys are left here in the floor of the New York Stock Exchange."
"Pete: Can we hit up Em, and see how Liz is doing?"
Kingston: Yeah.
"Zac: Em? Oh, Emiko."
Kingston: Yeah.
"Kingston: Yeah, how is, yeah, is there a way to—"
Pete: Wasn't Em watching her?
Kingston: I think that we asked Em to go check on her.
"Brennan: You see Alejandro is looking at the runes, immediately is like,"
"Alejandro: My God. This is as bad, this, we cannot imagine, the door is open. Okay. It is still, the door is open. The ritual is done. There still needs to be a… The paragon cannot come through without a great act of magic, a powerful, powerful spell. [heavy breathing] Robert must have something else up his sleeve, something else."
Murph: Wait—
Rowan: But he's dead. Something that he can cast from—
"Sofia: He said see you in the funny papers, right? It's gotta be some kind of clue."
"Rowan: Well, maybe he's just weird."
"Ricky: Who would say that? Do you know who would say, see you in the funny papers?"
Ally: Let me roll.
"Alejandro: It's an expression from, you face an anachronism, Robert Moses is undead, so—"
Lou: What time is it?
"Brennan: It is about nine o'clock at night, you guys also see there's scattered stuff up on the dais."
"Emily: Okay, so midnight, something's gonna happen at midnight."
Siobhan: It's gotta be—
"Ally: Can I Mind Link with… Gray baby, gray person—"
"Brennan: You can, or do you have Commune, or something like that? Yeah, you can like--"
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah, you reach out to Nod."
Ally: I let Nod know everything.
"Brennan: Cool. Nod says,"
"Nod: The door is open, I can't close it. It's rending the dream realm apart, something very powerful is happening."
Ally: Okay.
Murph: Can we investigate around?
Ally: Yeah.
"Emily: Do you guys think, though, something's gonna happen at midnight."
Ally: Nat 20 on Investigate.
"Brennan: Pete, you blink up, boom. Blink up to the dais. You look around, you see, all the stuff is here, the water from the fountain, Santa's list is here, the key to the city, all of that is here, and it’s just sort of lying, it looks like Robert discarded it as though after he used it for the ritual, it was of no more significance to him."
"Ally: Was there anything else, 'cause can we, each battle had something that he was gaining for this."
"Brennan: Also, you also see the Big Book of Bits and Bobbins up here, it is a goofy little clockwork book that has gears and stuff on the cover of it."
Emily: Any dog-eared pages?
"Ally: Can we look in it, yeah, and see—"
Brennan: You see that the little golden ribbon to hold a place is specifically to the page on time stones.
Ally: Did he use the time stone in this and discard it?
Brennan: You did not see him use the time stones.
Ally: Okay. That must be the big--
"Emily: The time stone uses energy from a specific time, it's gonna be midnight, the ball's gonna be dropping."
"Brennan: You see in the passage, Pete, as you read it, a time stone is used to power incredible spells of enormous magnitude."
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: You see notes written, sacrilegiously in this religious text, that Robert has warped something. He has a lich's phylactery, meaning when he is destroyed, he reforms at his phylactery, and he has found a way of turning his phylactery into a time stone."
"Ally: Oh, he's gonna come back as a time stone?"
Brennan: Or has turned—
Emily: Has already.
"Lou: He's going to come back at, he's going to be born in the time stone."
"Siobhan: So he wants to die, fuck! He wanted us to kill him!"
"Brennan: It also says, time stones gain the height of their power at specific times, dawn, dusk, the rarer the time, the more powerful the time stone is. So every hour—"
"Ally: New Year’s Eve, like midnight."
Emily: So we have to wait until leap year. Is it a leap year?
"Lou: [laughs] We have two months, everybody! We've got two months! Everybody go home, rest up!"
"Brennan: Also, just like the Grand Central, just like the Grand Central kiosk, time stones don't only draw power from specific time, they actually also draw power from being observed and being counted—"
Ally: The ball dropping.
Sofia: The ball is gonna be the fuckin' time stone.
Rowan: That ball is shiny as hell.
Sofia: Yeah.
"Rowan: I mean, obviously, not that I would ever have gone to Times Square, 'cause it's extremely gauche, in my opinion, to go to Times Square."
Pete: You can get M&Ms there! You can get custom M&Ms!
"Rowan: For New Year’s, though."
"Lou: All right, everybody."
Rowan: Yeah.
"Brennan: The last thing you guys find as well here is a small contract, a little unfinished piece of business, which was a contract from Titania, selling, or waving Faerie's right to Robert Moses's soul in exchange for him doing a favor of placing a mirror. [shrugs]"
Rowan: Man. She sold him back easy.
"Murph: Is, can we look at Santa's list, there?"
Brennan: Yep.
Siobhan: Mm-hmm.
Murph: Is Dale on there?
"Emily: Yeah, I was gonna ask that."
Brennan: Dale's name is on the nice list.
Ally: Is Kugrich on there?
"Zac: So he was alive at the time of that, right?"
"Siobhan: Right, is Robert Moses on the list?"
Brennan: This has the names of people alive and dead on them.
Emily: Yeah.
"Ally: Oh, got it."
"Lou: Well, I mean, I feel like we know what we need to do. I mean, the location's the only question."
Zac: Why did I think of Yankee Stadium?
Ally: Ball dropping at Yankee Stadium?
"Brennan: You see Alejandro shrugs, you feel the questing blade to you says,"
"Questing Blade: Well, the stadium, there we may find some of the spirits of heroes past. There is a boon waiting for you there, Ricky Matsui."
Pete: Cool.
Ricky: Okay.
Kingston: Only got three hours.
Siobhan: Right.
Ally: We have one—
Ricky: I have the Maserati.
[laughter]
"Rowan: Sick. Traffic on New Year's is a nightmare, though."
"Brennan: You see that the, you hear the car outside be like,"
Maserati: [gasps] [breathy] Traffic will not be of concern. [gasps]
Brennan: And you guys—
Rowan: The Maserati's a creep!
[laughter]
"Brennan: You guys, exhausted, depleted, look at each other and… It is three hours to midnight. And that is where we will end this episode of The Unsleeping City."

Rowan: Shotgun!
[laughter]
Ally: Fuck!
Brennan: You guys hear sort of the rolling of thunder.
"Emily: Like a natural thunder, like a—"
"Brennan: Yeah, natural thunder. No, extremely bad, apocalyptic."
Emily: Goddamn.
Nod: There is a very real chance that the world will change forever tonight.
Rowan: We need to get everybody that we know in on this.
Bilbry: The trumpets of war be blown!
"Sofia: I'm just determined, I don't fucking care."
"Announcer: Incredible night out here in New Year's, we're about to see the ball drop!"
[crowd counting down]
"Trash Cans: [gruff voice] Man, we gotta get the fuck out of here! Let's go!"
Kingston: Nat 20.
[Brennan gasps]
"Siobhan: Fuck, man!"
Nod: This is the hour. This is it.

[RECAP]
"Brennan: Robert Moses is here, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. There is insane money magic happening here. And he is casting magic through this web in the dream realm, though he cannot enter it."
Emily: That is so mean! I hate this motherfucker!
[Ally laughs]
Brennan: Those are vampires piloting kiosk mechs.
Robert: One of 'em's gotta go.
Brennan: You watch Pete's life leave his body.
Kingston: Come on! We got work to do!
"Brennan: Boom! You are, whoom! Sucked out of the dream realm, back into your body."
"Pete: Ahh, dad!"
Brennan: And the door opens.
[maniacal laughter]
Robert: I'll see you in the funny papers.
"Brennan: Whoom, and you take his fuckin' head off."
[imitates splattering]
Zac: That felt bad.
"Alejandro: The door's open, the ritual is done, the paragon cannot come through without a great act of magic."
"Rowan: Fuck, he wanted us to kill him!"
[END RECAP]
[dramatic music]
Brennan: Play some D&D?
Lou: Sure.
Emily: Yes.
Siobhan: Spicy! D&D!
"Lou: Yummy, yummy."
"Brennan: Hell yes, some spicy D&D. Welcome, one and all, to another exciting episode of The Unsleeping City. My name is Brennan Lee Mulligan, these are our intrepid heroes, say hi, intrepid heroes!"
Ally: Good morning!
All: Hi intrepid heroes!
Emily: Good morning!
Lou: Good morning.
Siobhan: It’s morning right now. We’re awake!
Ally: It's 7 AM!
"Siobhan: Oh my God, it's so early."
"Brennan: It's important for you guys to know if you're like, what's going on with this episode, we're shooting early today, because, because—"
Siobhan: Brunches and Dragons.
Both Siobhan and Zac are drinking coffee.
Brennan: Brunches and Dragons?
Ally: I spilled my peanuts everywhere.
Lou: That's how early it is. Ally's spillin' peanuts.
"Emily: Put them back, dude, you're just eating—"
Ally: I'm just gonna fish them out among my dice.
Siobhan: So nasty. All of those dice have been on the floor because you're so bad at throwing.
"Ally: Fuck you, nat 20 and you die! 9!"
Zac: A new die?
"Brennan: Last we left off, our intrepid heroes were on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, many of them having been gravely injured by the foul, necromantic powers of vampires, and the lich Robert Moses. Some of our heroes have indeed had their hit point maximum drastically reduced, they are battered, bloody, bruised, and beaten, having spent many spells and much blood and some treasure, including the Holy Grail Detergent, fighting the forces of evil in the New York Stock Exchange. Robert Moses was destroyed, but his spirit fled out of the New York Stock Exchange across the city, you guys summoned Alejandro, who looks desperate and, or not you guys, but Pete summoned Alejandro, who looks frightened and scared and desperate, and you guys are now on the dais, having looked up in The Big Book of Bits and Bobbins, all that has to do with the time stone, you also have Santa's list here, which I don't believe I described last time, but if there are any questions about who is on which part of the list—"
Ally: Am I on it?
Siobhan: Am I on it?
"Brennan: You are not. Rowan is not a human, a person, so Rowan does not-- Humans don't get to be on Santa's list? Non-humans don't get to be on Santa's list?"
"Emily is, confusingly, miming to Murph that he should eat the Bagel of All Things. They have a mouthed conversation that Murph doesn’t seem to understand."
Brennan: Fairies are exempt from the moral frameworks of mortals.
"Siobhan: Great, well. Narnia it is for me."
Zac: Flash.
Brennan: What did you just take a picture of over there?
"Ally: Sorry, the nuts look insane."
"Lou: Brennan, if you can take pictures during games, we can take pictures as well."
Ally: Yeah. Is Pete on the list?
Brennan: Pete is on the list.
Ally: [strained] On the good list?
Brennan: Pete's on the naughty list.
"Ally: No! Honestly, obviously."
Emily: I'm assuming Sofia's on the good list.
Brennan: Sofia's on the nice list.
Ally: Isn't it like an elastic list? Like if I'm starting to be good—
Zac: You're still selling drugs to children.
Ally: But I'm not happy about it.
Zac: You could stop.
Emily: How thick and bold is the print on Pete? Does it look like it's faded a little bit?
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: All of the print here is a delightful, festive, jolly calligraphy in a bold, red fountain pen. It looks that Santa happily transcribed everyone's names on this list, at whatever point that he made them with the same festive, jolly spirit, even though half of these people on one half of the list are doomed to damnation."
"Ally: Where's, hmm."
Emily: Where's Kingston?
Murph: Where's Kugrash?
"Siobhan: It feels like also it makes me like Santa less that he's like, yes, absolutely, I will doom these people. And I'll put coal, so they'll have a miserable time during their lifetime, and then a miserable time--"
"Ally: Yeah, adding the hell factor is like, ooh, Santa."
"Emily: Right, but did he know, did Santa know?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, he absolutely knew. He sold them to him, for money."
Zac: What?
"Brennan: Santa didn't sell it for, no, not for money. He's just, he was doing a favor."
Siobhan: I just assumed.
Ally: Bold claim!
Zac: What are you talking about?
"Siobhan: Look, he's gotta buy those presents somehow! How does he buy those presents?"
Lou: Fuckin' Santa is an aggressive capitalist.
"Siobhan: He's making the presents, but he gotta buy the materials."
"Brennan: Because I think, who rolled the nat 20 investigate? Our last time?"
"Murph: Pete, it was--"
Ally: Oh yeah.
"Brennan: It was Pete. Yes, so you see Sofia, Ricky, and Kingston are all on the nice list."
[Emily gasps]
Ally: That's good for you.
"Siobhan: Well, the good side and the bad side."
"Emily: Oh, yeah, cause me and Dale could be reunited."
Ally: Is Kugrich--
"Siobhan: Good kids, bad kids."
"Brennan: You see that, poor Kugrash is there on the naughty list with you."
"Pete: Hey, man. We're both trying our best out here."
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Pete: Well, I do agree that I could try a little bit harder."
"Kugrash: You've done some sustained damage, and I did a lot of damage at once, sort of a heavy hitter, and you're just consistent, out there every day, [pretends to swing a bat] just doing a little bad, getting on base."
"Pete: [laughs] Yeah, totally."
Ricky: Just constantly getting on base.
Pete: Yeah. Blasts.
"Kugrash: So many RBIs. So many RBIs from Pete, I just come out there, A-Rod."
Ricky: Grand slam.
Kugrash: Hit a homer.
"Pete: I sold, I sold speed to a babysitter yesterday."
"Emily: Can I come over to the list and see Pete looking at his name, and then write his name on the nice part?"
"Brennan: The ink is immediately absorbed into the list, but it's a nice gesture."
Pete: It was worth a try.
"Kingston: Hey, I think there is something we can all be doing to actually get these people on the nice list, and that's be talking about what we got going on this evening."
Pete: Let's do it.
"Kugrash: You know what's fucked up, is that I know Santa, and that we're friends. I'm not saying that I should be absolved of my sins, but you'd think it would help a little bit."
"Kingston: I mean, you know, you would hope that after the kindness you had done him, you know, earlier this month—"
"Sofia: Oh, shit, I forgot."
"Rowan: I don't know, I mean, I don't think Santa takes into account personal favors."
"Kugrash: You know what? Then that's why I respect him, that's why we are friends."
"Zac: I have 50 points of Lay on Hands, how are people—"
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: Do you guys look around, you guys hear sort of the rolling of thunder out in the sky—"
[sound of thunder rolling]
"Emily: Like a natural thunder, like a—"
"Brennan: [sarcastically] Yeah, natural thunder. No, extremely bad, apocalyptic—"
Emily: Goddamn.
Brennan: Evil--
Ally: Has this thunder had work done?
"Brennan: You guys also see, you know, the scraps of the ritual around here. You're very badly hurt, it is about nine o'clock at night on New Year's Eve."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: We have never taken a short rest before, but this is the exact time when a short rest comes into play."
[Emily gasps]
Siobhan: Can we do it on the bus?
"Sofia: No, I'm gonna get us, I'm gonna use my credit card, I don't care about worldly possessions. I'm gonna get us the nicest hotel room."
Pete: A penthouse—
Sofia: I want to get the penthouse!
"Kugrash: We don't need to go to a hotel, the world's about to end! Let's get in the car—"
Sofia: We deserve something nice!
"Kugrash: Let's take, we'll do it after New Year's! He’s gotta go to Yankee Stadium!"
"Ricky: I have to go to Yankee Stadium right now! I'm sorry, I have, you guys can do that if you want."
"Ally: Oh, can I pick up all the artifacts from the, what he did, I just stuff all the things he used—"
"Brennan: Yeah, oh, you stuff all—"
Ally: Even though he used them.
"Murph: Here's my feeling. I think that we need to get everybody that we know in on this. So you guys go to Yankee Stadium, fantastic. I think I should go to Grand Central Terminal and get the faeries on our side, and I think that if we can get Em and Willy and anybody else that we've ever met."
Sofia: Em’s my girl.
Rowan: How do you think the mummy is doing after he's spent the last 20 years trapped in an ankh? You think he's feeling like he's a better person?
"Kingston: Ah, I mean, I don't know, I could talk to him. We can see what's up."
"Zac: I'm, who needs to be healed, 'cause I'm gonna go now."
Ally: I have 19 points left.
"Emily: I got 21, my max is now 58 after these vampires."
"Murph: Does anyone want a Greater Restoration? It'd be my last fifth level spell, but I think that's fine. It's better to do it—"
"Siobhan: I mean, my max is only 54 right now, and my eventual max is 84, so—"
Murph: I think I could heal somebody's hit point max back to its normal.
Lou: So you're 30 points—
Siobhan: I'm 30 down.
Murph: 30 down? Jesus.
"Emily: I wouldn't mind a higher max, I wouldn't mind a higher max because then, that means that I can go to do, start doing radiant damage quicker."
Murph: Mm-hmm.
Siobhan: What’s your max...
"Emily: But I don't, you know."
Ally: How much are you down?
"Emily: My max is 84, and I'm currently, my max is 58."
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, so do Sofia."
Murph: That’s really bad. Cool.
"Emily: Are you sure you want to use a fifth level spell, though, right now?"
"Murph: I mean, what better time than to not waste an action and a spell, than to do it right now?"
Emily: Okay.
"Murph: Cool, I'm gonna do a Greater Restoration on Sofie."
"Brennan: Kugrash, you push out your little paw, your friend Sofie, all those big mac and cheeses and alleyways outside of bars, little rat—"
Sofia: The greatest restoration of all.
Kugrash: One more hangover cure. You fucking mess.
"Brennan: Your hit point maximum is restored, Kugrash, you hold your paw out and cast this healing spell, you've been doing good deeds in this city for so many years, and look at your little name on that naughty list still. And but Sofia is healed, a selfless act, you, whoom, restore her."
"Ally: I shoot Sofia's leg. No, I'm just kidding."
"Emily: I'm okay to keep my hit points low, but it's nice to have my max be high."
"Ally: Oh, right, oh, got it. I'm sorry, nevermind."
"Brennan: So your hit point max is restored, what we're gonna do now, I will actually, I'm not gonna make you guys wait 'til the end of the short rest, because you're not engaging in any strenuous activity over the next hour, we're just gonna roll your guys' hit points now."
Emily: Woo! Feeling good!
Lou: Yee ha!
Emily: Sofia Lee.
Siobhan: And then I get my Bardic back. Woo!
"Murph: Be nice if I had more Greater Restorations, you know, high level spells are good."
"Siobhan: Yeah! Funny, that."
Murph: Believe it or not.
"Brennan: Pete, as your Blink spell continues, by the way, you get flashes and images of Nod roiling in this insane dream storm. You look up, see the Golden Door fully open, the weird hex moving around it where the lock is keeping it open, and you see that that infection within the dream realm is just pouring power and trying to suck the thing out of the Golden Doorway. You see that there's a bunch of trash cans that are bouncing up and down the street, but sort of running, you're like,"
"Trash Cans: Man, we gotta get the fuck outta here! Let's go! [imitates metal clanging] Hey, man, if you got any fuckin' brains in your head, you gotta get the fuck outta here! [imitates metal clanging]"
"Brennan: You even see, up on top of the thing, holding on to a little railing, looking, is Pizza Rat with a little pizza tied to his belt."
Ally: Aww.
"Brennan: Looking out,"
Pizza Rat: [hand on its brow like a sailor] Things are startin' to look pretty bad out here!
"Brennan: And you see that Nod appears next to you as you kind of phase in and out of reality. Nod looks and says,"
"Nod: This is as bad as it could be. Anything that you need to do, there is a very real chance that the world will change forever tonight."
Pete: Okay. What should I focus on?
"Nod: I will be as close to the edge of the Dreaming as I can, but..."
[dramatic music]
Nod: This is the hour. This is it.
"Pete: Okay, well, me and everyone that I was with before, we're gonna go and try to find Bob Moses. We know it has something to do with the ball that's dropping in Times Square."
"Brennan: Nod reaches out, and sort of touches their head and says,"
"Nod: Something bad is happening at the Occult Society. At the library. And… Kugrash's son, something with Kugrash's son."
"Ally: Okay. Am I able to Blink back, or do I control the Blink?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you actually, your Blink spell probably ends."
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: Just, duration-wise."
"Pete: We have to go get Wally, he's at the Occult Society, and he's in trouble."
Sofia: Or is it the other son?
Pete: Oh!
"Murph: I ask the bagel who is in trouble. Or, has it been, when did I use it last? I used it to see if Esther was the one who—"
Brennan: I think you used it today.
"Murph: I used it today, fuckin' fuck."
Pete: Let's—
Kingston: Call people.
"Pete: Yeah, call her. We’re with Alejandro."
"Zac: Wait, do I have time to go to—"
"Brennan: Cool. You guys are looking around, you don't have too much time, but there's a bunch of stuff you guys have to do."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Murph: Cool.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm going to Grand Central."
"Brennan: Cool, Rowan is going to Grand Central."
"Zac: Wait, something's going on at the Occult Society?"
"Murph: I guess we'll go to the Occult, did we get the sense that the Occult Society and my family were the same thing, or they were separate?"
Ally: It was at the Occult Society.
"Brennan: I don't, I did not say that, I just wanted to say, I did not—"
Ally: Oh.
"Murph: Okay. I will go to Wally's house, then. Or Wally's apartment, and then I'll—"
Zac: I think I have to go to the Occult Society.
Lou: I can handle it if you have business you need to take care of.
"Zac: I just feel like, I think Ricky would go to the Occult Society."
"Murph: Or it might be David, I don't know how to to fuckin' figure this out."
Ally: I can go to one—
Emily: I can call Jackson and I can just go check out—
"Siobhan: Yeah, can you—"
Zac: We're with Alejandro right now.
"Ally: Yah, get Jackson to come with us."
"Murph: Oh yeah, can--"
"Emily: I can call, but I can call him, and rather than going all the way down, I could just call him and be like, hey, come through, and then go check on your son."
Murph: That's interesting.
"Kugrash: Alejandro, do you have any way to, for me to figure out which one of my sons is in trouble right now?"
"Brennan: [imitates whooshing] He just cast a Scrying on, he says,"
Alejandro: Do you have an address?
"Murph: Yeah, I give him Wally's address--"
"Brennan: [imitates whooshing] He scries on Wally's apartment, lights off, no one home."
Murph: Okay. What about David's house?
[somber piano music]
"Brennan: He looks, [imitates whooshing] you see a mostly dark home, Forest Hills, with one of the windows broken."
Murph: Goddamn it.
Brennan: A door slightly busted open.
Murph: All right. I gotta go to David's house.
"Ally: I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna do a Greater Invisibility and try to go to the Financial District and look around."
Brennan: You're in the Financial District.
Ally: Or to Bob Moses's--
Brennan: Lair or something?
"Ally: Lair, yeah, look around."
Emily: Could I call Jackson real quick?
"Brennan: Cool, you--"
Emily: And just see if I need to physically show up--
Ally: Also invite Em.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Dope. You give Jackson a call, it goes to, as you give Jackson a call, you see that it goes to voicemail. As it does, Kingston, you have a little residual, give me an Insight check."
Siobhan: [whispers] Nice.
"Lou: Very high, 19 plus 13. That's Perception, excuse me. Insight, that's also 13, 19 plus 13."
Brennan: 32?
Lou: Yes.
"Brennan: You, from the little trickles of electricity from your Shutdown spell, you feel that call go out, and know that Jackson's phone is at the Occult Society."
Lou: All right.
Emily: Oh!
Kingston: I think there's a lot going down at the Gramercy Occult Society.
"Ricky: Alejandro, do you know it's, do you sense anything about the Occult Society, there's something—"
"Brennan: He says,"
"Alejandro: I was, no, I was home, I was not at the Society."
"Brennan: He says,"
Alejandro: We should go now.
Lou: Can I text Emiko for an update on Liz?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Lou: As we go.
"Rowan: Sofia, maybe you can also get your family to come help, I mean—"
Sofia: I was thinking of texting Mario—
Rowan: Get some muscle in there.
Sofia: I don't trust my dad. I think he would flip for whoever pays the highest price.
Rowan: You don't think he wants you back?
Murph: I'm out of the door.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: I'm going to David’s.
"Brennan: Kugrash is out the door, going to David's place."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm headed to Grand Central."
Brennan: Rowan dips out.
"Zac: I'm, do you guys, can we go three deep in this Maserati?"
"Brennan: You see that, yes, you absolutely can. Cool."
"Siobhan: Sofia lying in the back, that shitty backseat. Where you have to put your knees way up in the air."
Brennan: Who all's getting in the Maserati with Ricky?
"Zac, Emily and Lou raise their hands."
Zac: The good kids.
"Brennan: Cool, the good kids—"
Emily: The nice list. [laughs]
Ally: Fuck you guys!
"Emily: I want to, I am so excited to, I'm secretly kind of excited to be in a Maserati, so I put on a little thing and think it's going to be like wind in my hair, but I'm just in that shitty third seat."
"Zac: You're just, it's shaking so much."
"Brennan: Pete, you're staying in the Financial District, looking—"
Ally: Inspecting and—
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and give me an investigation check."
Ally: Sure. Let's see. 9.
"Brennan: Cool. So, you guys get in this fuckin' sick Maserati, you see that Alejandro takes his Juul out, says,"
"Alejandro: We'll catch up later, Peter. [inhales]"
Ally: Cool.
[blowing smoke]
"Ally: I'll have Mindlink open with everybody, is that a thing I can do?"
"Brennan: Yeah. Whoom, make your Mindlink open, you see that Alejandro goes,"
"Alejandro: My God, this car is sick as hell!"
Ricky: It's really outside my comfort zone.
[sound of engine revving]
"Brennan: You guys tear off down the street. You see that, Kingston, you get in the car, and traffic just, [sound of tires squealing] like the Red Sea parts in front of you. [engine revving]"
Zac: It's Bruce Almighty?
"Sofia: This really is like a fuckin' movie, when do you ever get to drive a Maserati through New York City with no traffic?"
"Kingston: Honestly, nobody needs to be driving anything in New York City, everyone should be taking public transportation, but that’s just me."
Rowan: But there are some jobs that--
Sofia: If public transport looked like this.
[Zac imitates engine revving]
"Kingston: But this is sick, I mean, I'm not lying. I prefer taking the bus usually, but this is dope."
"Brennan: Awesome. Cool. Rowan, how are you getting to Grand Central?"
Siobhan: I am going to jump in a cab.
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: And be like,"
"Rowan: This is it, man. We gotta get to Grand Central as fast as possible."
Brennan: You see that--
"Siobhan: I'm sort of stand-sitting in the cab, like,"
Rowan: Get me to Grand Central [sound of thumping] right away!
"Brennan: See the cab driver says,"
"Cab Driver: I'm going to go at the pace that is— ...hello! Hi, yes."
Rowan: Now.
[engine revving]
"Brennan: The cab takes off, hops up on the sidewalk. [imitates thudding] Just dips into a bike lane, someone's like,"
"Pedestrian: Fuck you, man!"
Rowan: Fuck you!
"Pedestrian: Fuck you, hey, fuck you—"
Rowan: Fuck you!
Pedestrian: Go fuck yourself!
Rowan: Fuck yourself!
"Brennan: You see the cab tears off, you arrive at Grand Central. It is a strange night outside. [imitates thunder crashing] Thunder, a bunch of drunk people out already for New Year's Eve, [sound of cheering crowds] people are partying, you arrive at Grand Central a few minutes later."
"Siobhan: Great. I'm gonna go to the Whisper Corridor, Whisper Corridor?"
"Brennan: Yep. Or the Whispering Gallery, yes."
"Siobhan: Whispering Gallery, Jesus. And I'm gonna say,"
"Rowan: Now is the time, our people must assemble."
"Brennan: You hear, [imitates ticking sound] Bing! Ding-dong-ding-dong. Boom, opens up Bilbry. [imitates squeaking] A little, you know, bike pedal ornithopter comes out."
"Bilbry: Oh, oh, Miss Berry!"
"Rowan: Hi, how you doing?"
Bilbry: Good to see you!
"Rowan: Okay, we've all gotta go. We all gotta go."
Bilbry: What? The trumpets of war be blown? Assemble at the clock!
"Rowan: Oh, and before we run off anywhere, is there anything that you can do to pimp up this umbrella a little bit, make it a little fancier?"
"Bilbry: Oh sure, let me take a look at, here."
"Brennan: You see he snaps the knife off the front and takes a vial of mercury [sound of cork popping] and pours it on top of the umbrella, and a quicksilver knife of moving liquid silver—"
Siobhan: Sick.
Brennan: Appears at the end of your umbrella.
Bilbry: That should do the trick in a pinch! All right!
"Brennan: And you see that he takes off towards the Grand Central kiosk, the Umbral Arcana whips around it, and you see clock gnomes, sprites, pixies, dryads, you see that, in his little sort of tux with the bow tie untied, Priapus the satyr shows up."
Priapus: Oh my fuckin' God.
"Rowan: God. We don't have time, but later."
Priapus: Three minutes!
Rowan: Later!
[Brennan screams]
"Rowan: And I'm so sorry, but I didn't say, but we do all have to go to Times Square on New Year's Eve, and I'm sorry about that."
Faeries: Boo!
"Brennan: All the faeries,"
Faeries: Boo!
"Rowan: I know! But I want, I don't want to go either!"
"Brennan: I’m gonna need. To suggest to go to Times Square on New Year's Eve, I'm gonna need a persuasion check with disadvantage. [laughs]"
Siobhan: But I have advantage on persuasion.
Brennan: Then you're just gonna roll a flat--
"Siobhan: Oh wait, I don't have advantage on persuasion, goddamn. I just have it on performance. Goddamn it. Well, that is a nat one. I also got a 16. Fucking disadvantage."
"Brennan: You see that everyone goes like,"
"Fairies: New Year's Eve, it's gonna be a zoo, it's gonna be a zoo out there!"
"Rowan: You can fly, you lazy motherfuckers!"
[Brennan growls]
"Rowan: Goddamn, I should have just taken the crown."
"Brennan: [laughs] You see that all of the faeries sort of speak, Aquamarine is here, you see that in his plaza bathrobe, he clearly was taking a bath, Bobby Goodfellow shows up and goes,"
"Bobby: Oh, what the fuck is going on over here? We're calling some kind of war meeting?"
Rowan: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see that all of them say,"
"Faeries: Times Square's gonna be full of cameras and, yeah, it's gonna be full of, you know, fuckin' there's gonna be Cold Iron there, people are gonna be smoking."
"Rowan: Yeah, but also, Robert Moses, who is an absolute scumbag, is trying to destroy the American Dream."
"Brennan: You see that one of the little sprites looks and says,"
Sprite: [gasps] Oh no!
[dramatic music]
"Sprite: The vampires! You see, [imitates explosion] they're coming up in the Financial District."
Rowan: Now?
Sprite: Yes.
Rowan: To here?
Sprite: It looks like they're headed for Times Square.
Rowan: Everybody get on the goddamn seven train right now.
"Brennan: You see that Bilbry says,"
"Bilbry: Times Square is a shit show. We, I don't think it's safe for any faerie to set foot there. But you are founder of the faerie realm of New York. We'll cut those vampires off at the pass."
Rowan: Excellent.
"Brennan: You see he takes out a rifle that, instead of having a trigger section, just has a giant clock in it. [sound of ticking] And you see he says,"
Bilbry: We'll shoot those motherfuckers to the end of time! Time gun style! [sound of gun racking]
[Brennan imitates blasting]
"Rowan: And Bilbry, before you go, I think I'm gonna need the crown, if you have it available to me."
"Bilbry: Ooh. I, it's bad news. I did smelt it. But here you go,"
Brennan: And he just tosses a chunk of silver bouillon to you.
"Rowan: Great, I'll just put it in my pocket."
"Bilbry: It's, all the power of fae is in there."
Rowan: Great!
"Bilbry: But it's not, it's just a big chunk--"
Rowan: Bulky.
Bilbry: It's just a little bulky right now.
Rowan: That's fine.
Bilbry: Feel free to hoist that bad boy up if you need to.
Rowan: Thank you.
Bilbry: All right! Let's kill some leeches!
"Brennan: You see that the fairies charge out of Grand Central in this massive war party. Priapus leading the way, he's got his, you know, musical instrument in his hand. This big, did I say what his musical instrument was?"
Zac: I don't—
Siobhan: I don't remember.
"Brennan: I'm gonna say that he hoists, Priapus hoists a giant stand-up bass in one hand. He is fully erect and runs—"
Siobhan: Oh God.
"Brennan: Out of Grand Central. Bobby Goodfellow looks over and says,"
"Bobby: [shrugs] All right, well, let's do this thing."
Brennan: Runs out. Wonderful.
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: Everybody else, you guys head to Gramercy Occult Society, you guys arrive at the public library and you see on the steps, strange storm clouds in the sky. [sound of thunder rumbling] A weeping Orlando standing over the cracked body of Rovias. One of the stone lions has been cracked in half."
Ricky: Does anyone have a Mending spell?
"Kingston: I mean, I have Mending, but I'm assuming this is—"
Brennan shakes his head.
"Sofia: I mean, I'm discovering my spells every day, let me try."
"Kingston: Okay, Sofia, Sofie, this is not the time."
Sofia: Let me try. I got it!
Kingston: This is not the time.
Brennan: You see—
"Sofia: Hang in there, little stone guy!"
"Ricky: Orlando, what happened?"
"Brennan: You look around and Sofia, you see very fresh, there are injured and wounded and dead bodies of monks, of the Order of the Concrete Fist here. Looks like a huge fight happened on the steps."
Sofia: My God.
Lou: I run downstairs.
"Sofia: Yeah. Yah, I think we both just run downstairs."
"Brennan: You run downstairs. Alejandro runs with you. You see that Orlando looks up and says,"
"Orlando: Oh, vampires came and attacked here, we destroyed as many as we could."
Brennan: And you do see clumps of ash around the steps.
Orlando: [crying a little] My boyfriend. Rovias. My sweet lover. Oh!
"Brennan: You see he pets his giant, stone mane."
Orlando: I… He died defending the library. What is happening?
"Brennan: Alejandro looks, can't think of anything to say, just charges into the library."
Zac: I give the lion a hug.
Brennan: He nestles into you.
Emily: Still trying to medicine it.
Brennan: Go ahead and make a Medicine check.
Emily: 1.
Siobhan: No!
"Ally: A one, a nat one?"
Siobhan: You killed that lion!
Emily: I didn't kill him!
"Brennan: You go over and touch the body, and a bit more stone crumbles off, Orlando goes, [deep wail]."
"Sofia: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!"
"Ricky: Are they still fighting, is there still anything going on inside?"
"Orlando: Some of the greatest warriors were slain here on the steps, but some snuck past, some rose, mist form, made their way past here. [imitates roaring]"
"Brennan: This huge, mournful roar."
Zac: I run inside.
"Brennan: You rush inside. You go in, you see a couple of the monks recognize you, Sofie, bloodied and battered."
"Sofia: What's going on, tell me what—"
"Brennan: They say,"
"Monks: Don't worry, we beat 'em. They're defeated, but they made their way to the Chamber of the Umbral Engine."
Sofia: Where is that?
Monks: In the heart of the library.
"Brennan: You rush past. You get to a room, you know, crazy steps, M.C. Escher, you get to this giant chamber buzzing with arcane energy. [sound of ethereal humming] You see a bloodied Esther on a knee, next to what looks like an unconscious Jackson."
"Zac: I'll, I guess I can Lay on Hands. Both of them?"
Brennan: Cool. You start to do Lay on Hands them.
Zac: For 10 points each.
"Brennan: 10 points each. Cool, Esther still looks somewhat injured, but you reach down. [gasps] You see that Jackson comes to. You see that, in the center of the room, the Umbral Engine, an elaborate, huge orrery, this cosmic thing of a central brass globe covered in runes, spinning, gyroscoping wheels and sort of celestial bodies hovering around it. And you see that something has happened to it. There is some whirling necromantic energy, and it is fritzing and clicking against itself."
"Sofia: Okay, so all the people of New York can see magic for tonight."
Ricky: You sure?
Sofia: How does that help them do something?
"Ricky: They want people to witness the event, right? So maybe the Umbral Engine would have normally stopped them, is that right?"
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: You see that Jackson coughs, looks up, something else, go ahead and give me a Medicine check, anyone that wants to."
Emily: I'm maybe not going to. [laughs] I'm gonna let you guys--
Lou: Nat 20.
Emily: Ooh!
"Siobhan: Aw, hell yeah."
"Brennan: Cool. You see that there is, that Jackson's basically life force has been greatly diminished, his constitution score has been dramatically removed. I'm also gonna say that with that nat 20, you can just tend to their wounds, Esther and Jackson are back up at full hit points. But you see that Jackson's hit points are greatly diminished as his constitution has been dramatically reduced."
"Lou: Is there something, do I think there's something I can do spell-wise in order to restore that?"
"Brennan: On a nat 20, potentially there's something you could do to restore that."
"Zac: It's not a disease, right?"
"Brennan: It's not a disease. But it, there's is a high risk that whatever you did, in other words, you'd have to make a roll. So it'd be a roll of the dice, and it would take a great resource to be able to do it."
Lou: Okay.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see that Jackson is lying there. You see that Alejandro's talking to another member of the Occult Society, they can't find Ana and Amelia anywhere. It just looks bad here. You see Jackson looks up at Sofia, kind of smiles, he goes, and sees Kingston too and he goes,"
"Jackson: [weakly] What the hell, pal? Good to see you."
Brennan: You see he reaches up and touches the side of your face.
"Jackson: [sighs] How you doin', pal? You good?"
"Kingston: I mean, things are wild right now, but I'm doing all right."
Jackson: No shit. You took care of Moses?
"Sofia: I, his spell was successful. We're not done yet, ask me tomorrow, and the answer will be yes."
"Brennan: You see he nods and smiles, he goes,"
"Jackson: [sniffs] Ah, it's fucked up, why do we keep doing this shit? I'm glad we got some fresh blood in here, 'cause I could use retirement."
"Sofia: Well, for tonight, I think just, I think you do your thing. I mean, stay in, watch a movie, I don't know, don't watch the ball drop, I think that's gonna be a shit show."
"Jackson: Yeah, what am I gonna do, watch the fuckin' ball drop? Oh, my fuckin' Mets windbreaker, what the fuck, it's covered in blood, these assholes, you gotta go to the Mets store."
"Zac: Speaking of the Mets, the Yankees."
Sofia: Oh!
"Zac: Do you, Esther, do you know anything about the Yankee Stadium, I have something, I guess it's not speaking about the Mets."
"Brennan: You see that Esther looks at you and goes,"
Esther: Did you get some kind of vision or inclination?
"Ricky: There's, something happened when I was trying to remove the curse from Liz that I just saw a flash of Yankee Stadium, I don't know why, but—"
"Brennan: You see that she says,"
"Esther: Well, it's, she says, it's about 9:30, 9:40 now, if you got a vision, do you want company on the way?"
"Ricky: Yeah, let's go."
"Brennan: You see she says, all right."
Esther: I'm gonna go with Ricky. Great. We'll be back in a little while.
Brennan: You see that Ricky and Esther head out together.
[Zac imitates engine revving]
[sound of tires squealing]
Brennan: You rush off to Yankee Stadium.
"Ricky: I got a new car, by the, I don't--"
"Brennan: You see, she looks at, go ahead and give me a Persuasion roll?"
Murph: Oh no!
Emily: Oof!
Zac: 5.
Brennan: You see she goes—
"Zac: Oh, excuse me, 6."
"Brennan: Oh, 6. She goes,"
"Esther: Ugh, this is kind of gaudy, did you buy this?"
"Ricky: I didn't, no. Pete bought it for me."
"Esther: Pete, so… Do you think Pete got it honestly?"
"Ricky: Honestly, I don't, I don't think so. And it's kind of tearing me apart. It's really tearing me apart."
Emily: Ricky driving a Masaradi bought with drug money.
Esther: These things just guzzle gas.
"Ricky: It's really bad in a lot of ways. I feel really uncomfortable driving it. But it is very fast. Hey, look, I mean, you know I would never choose this, right?"
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Esther: I mean, yeah, I guess, yeah. I guess."
Brennan: You see that—
"Zac: Just kind of like, silent driving for a—"
"Brennan: You see Esther opens her, opens her spellbook up, and does something, [imitates whooshing] as you guys start heading out from the library, and you see that this spectral road just made of pure light peels off."
Ricky: Look at that.
"Brennan: She goes,"
Esther: Take this.
Brennan: [sound of tires squealing] as she holds concentration on this spectral road. And you peel off into the sky on this Maserati—
Ricky: Awesome.
[Brennan imitates engine revving]
"Brennan: Headed off towards Yankee Stadium. Jackson sort of on the ground, looking very fucked up. He looks up at you, Sofia, and you see he says,"
"Jackson: [groans] How you holding up, kid? You all right?"
"Sofia: Yeah, I'm doing fine. Yeah. Kug gave me a fuckin' fat ass fifth level spell, so I'm doing excellent. I'm doing better than I should be."
"Jackson: So what's the deal? Moses got his spell off, what kind of spell is this? What are we lookin' at?"
"Sofia: He's making, oh, did I not fill you in on any of this? He's making a lock to go, he wants to go to Nod. Nod made it so that no one could come into Nod, he created a lock, and Sinatra's Law, he created a lock here so that he could create one over there. And now I'm assuming he's doing something, I'm assuming he's made some sort of thing with harnessing a time thing, what is the time thing called?"
"Kingston: The time stone, time stone, no you got this. You got this!"
"Sofia: So yeah, I think he's making a time stone using the auspicious timing of midnight. The energy of, you know, the ball dropping."
"Jackson: And he's and what's, he's doing that to what, live forever?"
"Kingston: I mean, we believe based on the Book of Bits and Bobbins that he's using the time stones to—"
Jackson: Which Book of Bits and Bobbins?
Kingston: The time gnomes’ Book of Bits and Bobbins.
"Jackson: No, but is it the little one or the big one?"
"Kingston: No, it's a big book, it's a big book."
Sofia: It's a big book.
Jackson: Gotcha.
"Kingston: Yes, I'm not."
Sofia: Not the Bitty Book of Bits and Bobbins.
Jackson: The Bitty Book of Bits and Bobbins. We wish. [coughs]
Sofia: I think he's trying to turn Manhattan into a place where only the undead can hang out.
Kingston: Yeah.
Sofia: Or some sort of—
Zac: Paragon or—
Sofia: Place where only he and his folk can be.
Kingston: On the level of Heaven and Hell.
Sofia: Yeah.
Kingston: Manhattan will become.
Sofia: He's making a realm.
[Jackson sighs]
Kingston: It's heavy stuff.
Jackson: This is heavy stuff.
"Sofia: Yeah, it's a lot."
"Brennan: You see Alejandro's looking around, he looks very distraught like, he's scrying for his granddaughters. He turns, he sort of uses up his Scrying spell, and then turns to one of the other wizards, says,"
"Alejandro: All right. Fine, I'll try to find Ana and Amelia."
"Brennan: You see he turns to Jackson, Jackson says,"
"Jackson: Alejandro, oh, good to see you, bud. So this is it. They're gonna try to pull it out of the dream realm, the Golden Door."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Jackson: Fuck. Well, I'm… This is bad. [sighs] This is what Dale was warning me about. He thought this was gonna happen."
"Sofia: Dale? Thought this was gonna happen? Goddamn, he had a whole fuckin' life without me. I had a fuckin' book club."
"Brennan: [laughs] You see he goes,"
"Jackson: Yeah, that's, Dale was into that whole chosen one bullshit."
[somber music]
"Jackson: He… He thought there was gonna be a time where the dream realm would try to fully destroy New York. And he was a fuckin' new kid, but he had a lot of big ideas about, you know, the symbol of our order is that yin and yang, right? And specifically between the energy of dream and of the waking world. And the stuff he found, the scrolls and the monastery that talked about the chosen one, they all, he was on this trip about the fact that those forces should be combined and used together rather than us as monks standing as a guard against the dream realm. [sighs] He believed in it, and he went and found the pinnacle, he went all the way up there, and… It was all bullshit. Nothing happened."
Sofia: Where's the pinnacle?
"Brennan: You see he looks at you, make an Insight check."
"Emily: 15\. No, 16."
"Brennan: He's looking at you with kind of a look of, why do you want to know?"
"Emily: I give him a look of, because I asked, because I want to know."
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"Jackson: What'cha gonna do? You want to… [sighs] All right. Well, fuck it. I'm out of commission. It is what it is. The scrolls talked about a place that, at the time, was unreachable, except for powerful monks, but they ended up, but they ended up building the Empire State Building to reach it."
Sofia: I was kind of thinking you might say that. All right.
"Brennan: He says,"
"Jackson: But Dale was, you should know, don't get your fuckin' hopes up, it's not a dream, kid. This is the real world."
"Sofia: I get it, it is what it is. You taught me well."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
Jackson: There are—
"Sofia: I'm gonna put that in my back pocket maybe after I slay the dreams of Robert Moses, to save the dreams of others. I'll go to the observation deck."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Jackson: He thought that there would be, he got up there, and there were no spirits, there were no ancestors, there was no sphinx, the fuckin' make, to choose the one. So it was all fuckin' bullshit, so just keep your eye on the prize, I don't know, maybe we all die. Mm, it is what it is."
"Sofia: All right, I'm gonna go get, maybe a Jamba Juice or something. I'll be back."
"Brennan: Alejandro goes,"
Alejandro: A Jamba Juice?
"Sofia: Yeah, I need a little—"
Alejandro: On New Year's Eve? Will they even be open? That would be crazy.
"Sofia: This is true, that's somewhat cruel to patronage somewhere that--"
"Alejandro: Well, if you want a Jamba Juice, can you get me an energy boost guava mango?"
Kingston: And can you get me one of them waffles?
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah, I'll bring 'em, I'll meet you at Times Square."
Alejandro: You're going to ask Sofia to get you a waffle from Jamba Juice?
"Kingston: Jamba Juice they sell a waffle, it's like a pastry, but it's like a waffle. It's in the clear thing."
"Alejandro: All right, well—"
"Kingston: Don't come at me, mister—"
Sofia: I know exactly what he's talking about.
Kingston: Thank you!
Sofia: I will get you a waffle.
"Alejandro: It's like, hey, let's go to like a halal place and get, you know, fries there, it seems like, go to Jamba Juice to get juice, you know?"
Kingston: You ever have the fries at a halal place?
Alejandro: They're-- They are really good.
Kingston: They're delicious.
"Alejandro: Actually, you know what? Kingston it seems like they have some stuff to take care of,"
Kingston: Two waffles.
"Alejandro: My granddaughters are missing, I can’t find them—"
Kingston: Can I help you?
Alejandro: You want to get a chopped cheese at the corner?
"Kingston: Me and you want, you don't want to try and find your daughters, you want to go get a chopped cheese?"
"Alejandro: I don't know, man. I can't find them."
"Kingston: Fuck it, let's get a chopped cheese. You go get a—"
"Sofia: If you are getting chopped cheeses, am I still getting waffles?"
Kingston: No. We're good on waffles.
Sofia: Okay.
"Alejandro: All right, we're getting chopped cheeses, you get your Jamba Juice."
"Brennan: Cool. You guys head out. Awesome, awesome, awesome."
Emily: I go immediately to the Empire State Building.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Dope as hell.
Siobhan: Climbing up the outside like King Kong.
"Emily: [laughs] I bet I could! Wait, how tall is the Empire State Building?"
Siobhan: It's really fuckin' tall.
"Murph: You could still probably run up it, you're a superhero."
Brennan: We're gonna cut over real quick to Pete.
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: So you got a 9 on your investigation, so they peel off, you run out into the street, and you start investigating. You're looking at Wall Street, there's a post office box."
"Ally: I pull out my business card from Bob Moses, I go to his work."
Brennan: Awesome. You arrive at his—
Ally: I cast Minor Illusion to make myself look like a vampire.
Brennan: Awesome.
Ally: And then I go up to the front and I look like the most intimidating vampire possible.
"Brennan: Rad! Let me roll a little check here. Cool. You arrive at the front, and you see that there's a, kind of like, just graduated ivy league, huge party school frat lookin' vampire, who's standing at the outside of the building as you walk up, and he goes,"
"Vampire: 'Sup, bro?"
Pete: Hi.
"Vampire: Hey, what's up?"
Pete: Is he here?
Vampire: Is who here?
Pete: Is the boss in?
Brennan: Give me a Deception check.
"Ally: Mkay. Yeah, 28."
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Vampire: Nah, dog. He's at the Stock Exchange doing fuckin' rituals, so..."
"Pete: No, that's over, man. Where is he now? I just talked to him, I think he's here."
"Vampire: You're welcome to go fuckin' check, brah, but—"
Pete: All right.
"Vampire: Probably you should be up with the push, right?"
Pete: Buzz me in.
"Vampire: Dude, it's chill. Don't be a fuckin' dick, bro."
Pete: I don't have time for this.
Ally: I flex my fake fangs.
"Brennan: He goes, oh. [hisses]"
[Ally and Brennan hiss]
Ally: I fucking deck him!
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Vampire: Uh! Fuck, bro, I'm sorry, fuck!"
Brennan: Buzzes you in.
"Vampire: Fucked up, fuck."
[Zac mimics hissing]
[Ally hisses]
"Brennan: Cool, you walk into this..."
Ally: I try to get to his office and look around. I don't know.
"Brennan: You get to his office, and you see that there is a enormous, there is an enormous, there is an enormous arcane kind of lock on the door of his office. The door to his specific office is warded with some crazy magical shit."
Ally: Hmm.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Arcana check.
Ally: Sure. 7!
"Brennan: Cool. You're looking at it, you don't think that, it looks like a big mamma-jamma, like a Dispel would have a slim chance of success here. You see that there's a arcane passcode for it. But your arcana does not reveal it to you what that code would be. We're gonna cut over to Kugrash. Kugrash, how are you getting over to Forest Hills, which is a long way away."
Murph: Giant eagle.
[Brennan screeches like an eagle]
"Brennan: [imitates whooshing] Bald eagle flying, or maybe a dirty--"
"Murph: Bald because, not a bald eagle..."
Siobhan: Literally bald.
"Murph: But a bald eagle, if it makes sense."
Brennan: [flapping like a swimmer] Dirty trash eagle flying across the city skyline.
Ally: Flying this way?
"Brennan: Yeah, a breaststroke. [gasps]"
"Murph: I like to think I put in a lot of effort and then fall for a while, and then put in a lot of effort and fall—"
Lou: It's mostly gliding.
Emily: Just running into telephone poles.
Zac mimes with his hand an extremely crooked flight path.
Brennan: You get to David's house. You see there are now cop cars here.
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: It looks like Diane and Matt and Delia are outside the caution tape, kind of crying, and you see that Wally is there with them."
Murph: Okay. I'll fly up to Wally.
Brennan: All right.
"Murph: Actually, you know what? Let me… I want to fly in, while I'm still a bird, I want to fly into the house."
"Brennan: Give me a Stealth check with disadvantage, if you'd be so kind."
Emily: A bird flying into a house?
Siobhan: A fuckin' giant eagle in Forest Hills.
"Ally: The Umbral Arcana is gone, So they’re seeing a giant actual eagle—"
Murph: They'll just fuckin' wave me away. Okay.
Ally: Yeah!
"Murph: 11 was my bad one, buh-buh-bah. 19."
"Brennan: [laughs, impressed] You see that there's a cop at the door going,"
"Cop: [into a shoulder pager] This is a crazy New Year's, we've had a B&E and an assault, Forest Hills."
"Brennan: He turns, an eagle, whoosh!"
Cop: The fuck was that? [sound of radio beeping]
Zac: Just the wings tucked in?
"Cop: Little APB, guys, keep an eye out for a very large pigeon."
Murph: Just like a piece of trash.
"Brennan: Yeah, you kind of flop in. There's a bunch of cops walking around in here. And you are literally like, [singing] bum-ba-da-bum-bum, bum ba-da, and you're kind of like walking in that weird way that birds walk. [bouncing his shoulders like a pigeon]"
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: Like behind the sofa, under a little desk."
Zac: This is a Pixar short film.
Ally: I'm such a fan.
Emily: Your investigation looks like this. [jerks head around like a pigeon]
Ally: Yeah. Head all the way around.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Investigation, there's a bunch of stuff in here that's obvious to see, but go ahead and give me an Investigation check."
"Murph: Fuck! Fuck. Buh-buh-bah. So bad, 4."
"Brennan: 4, cool. You are in here, you around, you see David is..."
Murph: Fuck!
"Brennan: Bitten on the neck. His computer is open, and there's a small box next to it. He's unconscious, bitten, it looks, give me a Medicine check."
Murph: Okay. 13.
Brennan: It's hard to tell what's happening with David.
Murph: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: But it's bad.
Murph: Okay. Do I see if any of the cops are vampires?
"Brennan: Sure, yeah, go for it. Make a Perception check."
[sniffs]
Murph: 13.
Brennan: You do not believe that any of the cops are vampires.
Murph: Okay.
"Brennan: You see the computer, though. And there's a small box on the desk next to it. You would have to get closer to take a look."
"Murph: Okay, I'll go closer."
Brennan: Give me another Stealth check.
"Murph: Okay. Actually, oh God, I was gonna say, I'll touch him with my cockroach or something, but they're going to be stupid, they're not gonna know what they're looking at. 18."
"Brennan: Cool. You flutter up to a chair, there's a cop literally just looking at his phone. You eagle up to this chair, he's not facing away from you, he's facing towards you, he's just very into what he's doing. You look at—"
"Murph: Eagle eyes, I can see."
"Brennan: Eagle eyes, you see it! You look at the computer screen, and you see that there's an open email to you on it, from David."
Murph: [whispering] Goddamn it.
"Brennan: The email says, there's no emotional language in it, nothing like that. You see that it just starts with,"
David: Pulled up some info on RM.
Murph: Mm-hmm.
"David: Found the following. This guy was a real fuckin' crook and a dirtbag. I don't know why you need this, but if this helps, then here it is."
"Brennan: There are, you get your little mouse, you get your little eagle talon on the mouse, start scrolling. [sound of scroll clicking] And..."
Lou: What is my man looking at on his phone?
Zac: Just scratching a laptop.
"Brennan: You look at a series of financial documents, records, stuff like that. And you see there is a… There are a couple..."
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: Very old photographs of Robert Moses that are in here, there's one of him at his office, and you see that, it's him sort of breaking in the new office down on Wall Street."
Murph: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: And you see that there's a little funny ribbon cutting ceremony, like a small kind of joke ribbon cutting ceremony. And that he has, there's little pins with him and some other people here, and the pins are these little gag gift things that say Rosebud on them."
Murph: Uh-huh.
[suspenseful music]
Murph: Rosebud.
Siobhan: It's Robert Moses's sled!
"Emily: Yeah, that's it."
"Brennan: You also see, in the box next to the computer, a ton of envelopes, sealed, addressed to dad."
"Murph: Cool. I'm gonna, hmm. All right. I'm a bird. So I can't do too, too much. But I am, goddamn it, all right. He's been bitten by a vampire. [sighs] I want to try to take a little, I have a spell I could maybe do in a couple days if he's dead. I'm gonna try to steal some of his hair."
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: To have a piece of his body.
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Not for— [laughs]
Lou: Okay.
"Murph: I don't need to, you're not here! [laughs]"
Ally: [laughs] You're not here!
"Murph: I'm trying to save his life! [laughs] I know I'm a fuckin' rat. Do I need to do a Stealth, I assume?"
"Brennan: Yes, you do."
"Murph: Okay, that's 23."
Brennan: Incredible.
Murph: It's the only thing I'm rolling good on.
"Brennan: You go over, snip some hair off with an eagle's talon, cop does not see you."
Murph: I would like to grab the letters and just leave.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: It's just right in front of his—
"Brennan: You grab a full thing of letters, walk out of there. You actually, it's you dragging the box behind you. One of the cops—"
Siobhan: Flapping slow like—
"Brennan: You see that, as you drag it out, a couple of cops step over you, just very talking to each other. You Mission Impossible your way out of the house. And you get all the way to the rest of the family."
"Murph: Yeah, I'll talk to Wally."
"Brennan: Dope, awesome. You get out there, Diane's there, you see that Wally looks over, sees you, and goes,"
"Wally: Oh, look! That eagle is writing a bunch of letters to its dad!"
[Murph laughs]
"Kugrash: Sort of, you're the only, you're very perceptive, Wally. It's me, it's me, your dad."
Wally: What?
"Kugrash: Yeah, you know I can turn into animals."
"Wally: Oh. Right, yeah, yeah, I remember that."
"Brennan: Are you standing, are you like—"
"Murph: I'm gonna, I feel like I'm gonna signal for Wally to come, I feel like—"
"Brennan: Yeah, Wally—"
Murph: The children and stuff have had enough of a day.
"Brennan: Yeah, Wally?"
"Murph: Just Wally, yeah."
"Brennan: Yeah, comes over to you."
"Wally: What's up, dad?"
Kugrash: What happened with David here?
"Wally: Oh, it was an attack, someone broke into their house and beat the crap out of him. But I think he was maybe workin' on that stuff that you asked for."
"Kugrash: Yeah. Goddamn it. All right, Wally. You got... [sighs] Where you gonna be tonight?"
"Wally: I was probably gonna go home, make some hot dogs with string cheese."
"Kugrash: Okay. I was gonna tell you to, why don't you take… Take Diane and the kids with you? Maybe you all go?"
Wally: Go to Denny's?
"Kugrash: Yeah, go to Denny's, go to a public space!"
Wally: Oh boy!
Murph: I give him some gold to take the family to Denny's. [laughs]
Kugrash: Take the family to Denny's on me!
"Brennan: You give him some gold, [laughs] so you drop some gold—"
"Murph: Gold, I'm playing D&D."
Lou: Gold...
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Wally: Okay! He goes, hey guys! We're gonna go to Denny's! We're gonna pay with these Spanish doubloons!"
Kugrash: I found some gold in the trash!
"Wally: Hey guys, it's Christmas."
Brennan: You see that he--
Zac: It's not Christmas.
"Brennan: Fully not Christmas. You see that Diane suddenly says,"
"Diane: Wally, where did you get those gold coins? What's happening?"
Wally: I got 'em from this bird! He's my friend— [sighs] He's my dad.
"Brennan: And you see she goes,"
"Diane: Wally, come here, we're gonna, okay, we can go to Denny's."
Wally: Okay! I'm buying! Moon Over My Hammy!
"Ally: I always want that and I don't want to say it. I say, this ham sandwich thing, please."
"Brennan: You see, cool, they take off, you get this box full of letters."
Murph: And my son's hair.
Brennan: And your son's hair.
Murph: Fuck me.
Lou: Don't forget he's got his son's hair.
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: What's Kugrash do now?
"Murph: I wish I had a Greater Restoration or something more that I can do, but I don't think I can—"
Emily: I'm sorry that you wasted it on me.
"Murph: Super help. Okay, let me—"
Emily: I'll help prevention.
"Murph: I feel like I'm pressing my luck constantly, poking in and out of that house, but I'm gonna, I'll try, I don't think a Healing Word's gonna do shit for him, but I'll try to do, I'll try to just get near the windows so where I can get eyes on him and just try Healing Word, and see what happens."
"Brennan: Dope. You jump into a Healing Word, and you see that he, [gasps] wakes up."
Murph: Oh fuck! Okay.
Brennan: The cop does not notice.
Murph: [laughs] Goddamn it.
Lou: Same one?
Brennan: Same one on his phone.
Lou: Hey—
Ally: He's watching Last Week Tonight. With subtitles.
"Siobhan: This world, this world."
Lou: Dialysis is fucked up.
"Murph: All right, if he's awake, then I gotta come out of, fuck, I've only got two Wild Shapes for the day. All right. Oh wait, I lost my Wild Shape, 'cause I had to do that to cast a spell. Dope. I'm fucked. I'm just gonna cast Pass Without a Trace on myself."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: So that I could go in and try to talk to him.
Brennan: Cool. Go ahead and give me a Stealth check.
Murph: Cool. 22.
"Brennan: Cool. You dip in, as you sneak past, you see that they're talking to, they're just talking to David as he's waking up, paramedics are now in there talking to him. He's trying to not go. You see that he looks at, he notices you."
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: And goes,"
"David: Excuse me, I gotta go to the bathroom, hold on one sec."
"Brennan: And he walks in, he walks into the bathroom, goes,"
David: Dad?
"Kugrash: Yeah, you were attacked?"
"David: Some fuckin' asshole broke in here and beat the shit out of me, fuckin' bit my neck and shit."
Brennan: You look and see that David's reflection in the bathroom mirror is transparent.
[ominous music]
"Kugrash: Hey David, buddy. Do you feel weird?"
David: Hungry.
Lou: Oh!
"David: Go for like, I could go for a rare steak. Like, a rare steak."
Kugrash: Dammit. All right.
Emily: Make him a beet smoothie.
Kugrash: Oh God. David.
David: Yeah?
[ominous music]
Kugrash: You--
Emily: [whispering] Knock him out.
Murph: [whispering] I don't want to—
Emily: [whispering] He's a danger.
Lou: That little Sofia voice in the back of your head never says good things.
Murph: Oh God!
"Brennan: As he looks at you and says,"
"David: Dad, I was making an email about Robert Moses and shit. Look…"
"Brennan: Do you still have the box of letters with you, by the way?"
"Murph: Yes, I do."
"Brennan: You see he looks and says,"
David: Did you take that?
"Kugrash: Yeah, I figured they were, yeah, I kind of stole them. I'm sorry, I saw they were labeled to me."
David: Fuckin' rat piece of shit.
"Kugrash: I'm fuckin' sorry, they were written, my name was—"
Ally: Your hair is sticking out too.
"Brennan: You see that he looks and says,"
"David: They're fuckin' stupid. Don't, there's nothing worth, there's nothing worth reading in there, if shit's about to hit the fan."
Murph: I'll read it.
"Brennan: You open one, he says,"
"David: No, don't."
"Brennan: And you see, it's backdated many, many years. And it's a… There's probably, you've been gone for a couple decades, right, there's probably 50, 60 letters in here."
Murph: [whispers] Goddamn it.
"Brennan: And you see that, it says,"
"David: Hey dad. Don't know where you are. Matt did great in school this year, we're real proud of all the work he's done. It looks like he might get to take some advanced classes next year. Diane got a promotion at work."
"Brennan: And it's just letter after letter of him writing to you over the years, letting you know what was going on in his life."
"Kugrash: Oh God, David. I'm… I would say sorry, but there's just, there's no… There's no apology I could give you for not being around."
"Brennan: You see David looks at you and goes,"
"David: I don't know, dad. Talk is cheap. I don't really give a shit about an apology."
Murph: Yeah—
"David: Actions… I'm helping you because Wally told me what you've been doing in your time. I would have, I would have loved for you to figure out how to not be a piece of shit when you were around me. But you'd have to be an asshole not to recognize when someone's trying not to be a piece of shit in general. And… I don't know that we're good, but that doesn't mean you're not good. And… I guess you're worth helping."
"Kugrash: David, you are such a goddamn ball buster. And I'm so proud of the man you've become. I know it doesn't—"
"Brennan: [moans, gestures to his eyes] Just proud of the man you've become, fucker's crying,"
"David: You fuckin' asshole piece of shit, make me cry."
Brennan: Just blood coming down his face.
"Kugrash: Oh God! David, look."
David: The fuck is wrong with me? [screams]
Brennan: Looks in the mirror.
"Kugrash: Yeah, so all this magic stuff, the guys who attacked you, Robert Moses is, you know about vampires. The movies and stuff."
David: I don't go in for that shit. I like Rudy. You know—
Kugrash: You know you can't see yourself in a mirror.
Emily: Rudy?
"Kugrash: I have not, I don't think I've seen the film Rudy. I would, I became a, one day we'll watch Rudy, me and—"
"David: Yeah, and Wally. If we're all still alive, we'll watch it."
Kugrash: But I think—
"Ally has their eyes squeezed tight shut and their hand in a fist in front of their face, laughing silently."
Brennan: Ally really liked that.
Ally: Oh my God.
Zac: Did tea go in your nose?
Murph: Yeah.
Ally: Tea from long ago.
"Kugrash: But David, you've been infected by whatever it is that Robert Moses has, by the, there's an arcane evil in addition to the regular kind of—"
David: Gotcha.
"Kugrash: White collar bullshit that's going on, so you are going to turn into something that's gonna be able to hurt your family and your friends."
David: Fuck!
"Kugrash: Yeah, it's fuckin' bad, man."
David: Stop it!
"Kugrash: Yeah, I will, I would stop it, I don't have a way to stop it right now except to like, I can bring you with me and just tie you up. I think this is all gonna be, basically the world's gonna end or it's not gonna end in a few hours. At midnight, Robert Moses is doing this whole thing."
"David: All right. I'm gonna sit tight, I don't, these cops,"
"Brennan: You see that one of the cops goes,"
Cop: Everything all right in there? You need some toilet paper or what's…
"David: [yelling] I'm good! [quiet] Look, if you guys shut the deal, the world's gonna maybe end in a couple hours?"
"Kugrash: Yeah, like I was saying, Robert Moses has, is doing some kind of ritual to make all this magic stuff kind of come take over."
"David: Ok. Yeah, I was doing it, but the email I was gonna send you, there's some shit there—"
"Kugrash: What is Rosebud, do you know what Rosebud is?"
"Kugrash: Rose, oh, that's not finance shit, that's just like, that was a gag. Citizen Kane was big the year that they opened the office downtown, so they refer to the office as the Rosebud Club, there's a bunch of rosebud shit everywhere, just kind of a gag."
Kugrash: Okay.
"Brennan: Pete, what are you doing down there?"
Ally: I have proficiency in thieves' tools. Can I try to start hacking or—
"Brennan: It's an Arcane Lock, so you're gonna roll with disadvantage, but you can go ahead and roll."
"Ally: Okay, cool."
"Murph: Do I know that Pete is at the office, 'cause when we split?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I think you do know that."
"Murph: I want to text Pete and say,"
"Kugrash: I don't know if this means anything to you, but Rosebud. [laughs]"
Pete: What?
"Kugrash: Rosebud is significant to Robert Moses, it's some kind of gag, some kind of secret thing."
Lou: Are we all in a chain?
"Murph: Yeah, yeah, I'm group chatting."
"Siobhan: Oh, we've got Mindlink on. Right?"
Ally: It's only 30 feet.
"Siobhan: Oh, okay, nevermind."
Emily: Sofia starts texting anagrams of Rosebud.
Ally: I put in Rosebud.
"Brennan: Beep beep, beep beep beep beep. [imitates metal clanking] Whoom! Opens."
"Ally: Fuck yeah, I walk in."
Zac: I'm completely ignoring it 'cause I'm driving.
"Ally: Oh yeah, you have that thing that texts all of us a message that's like, I'm driving."
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see Esther in the shotgun thing says,"
Esther: Do you want me to answer that?
Ricky: I probably shouldn't.
Esther: Do you want me to?
Ricky: Oh… If you feel comfortable.
Esther: Why would I not feel comfortable?
"Ricky: I mean, just 'cause the car's moving."
Esther: I'm riding as a passenger--
"Ricky: You know what, you can do it, I think it's, the stakes are high enough."
Brennan: She starts to go into your pocket to get the phone.
"Esther: Sorry, can you just raise your, 'cause the, you're making a crease in your lap. Could you just raise your pelvis up a little bit to open the pocket up?"
Ricky: Like this? [awkwardly lifts his hips]
"Esther: That's good, that's fine, thank you. Good. [clears throat]"
"Ally: And it just says, Rosebud."
"Brennan: And she starts relaying the texts to you. And yeah, she starts to relay the texts. As she does so… You see she starts to go through your phone, and she says,"
"Esther: You text your friends, John, John, and John, your mom, your sister, and me."
"Ricky: Yeah, pretty much. Those are the people I text."
"Esther: God, that's a lot of selfies."
"Ricky: Oh, I just, I just like to let people know what I'm up to."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: She looks over at you, shakes her head."
Ricky: Selfies are good because you can get yourself and then what you're doing in one picture.
"Esther: Right, but wouldn't the presence of a photograph coming from your phone kind of imply your presence there?"
"Ricky: [nods] Okay. Yeah, I see that."
Esther: It's all right.
"Brennan: You see— You tear off in the car. Pete, you walk into this place. Give me another investigation check."
Ally: Cool.
Murph: Fuck!
Ally: What do you think it was?
Brennan: I think it was a nat 1.
Ally: It was.
Brennan: A nat 1?
Ally: It was absolutely a nat 1.
"Brennan: Cool. Awesome. You walk in, you—"
Ally: Is there a way to use Intimidation or—
Brennan: You can do--
Ally: Persuasion--
Brennan: You can do an Arcana check.
Ally: Can I?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Ally: Thank God. 19, five, 24."
"Brennan: Okay, so you're not able to, you're trying to snoop around and it's like, you're like, God, I've never worked an office job, I have no idea where shit goes in a fuckin' office. What you do find, though, is there is a small felt, [eerie music] sorry, a small velvet lined, ancient mahogany box that you detect the scent of this, for decades, held Robert Moses's phylactery. The place where his lich's soul lived. It is not here anymore. But you see the tiniest little print of the beginning of a rune that would have been drawn on the phylactery. With that 24 arcana check, you know that [eerie music] this rune begins a sequence that if spoken aloud, would allow somebody to destroy the phylactery. Robert Moses's body was destroyed, and liches don't come back for, he's, let me just double check, I don't think they come back for days... Fuck it, I'm the DM. They don't come back for days. You see that, so Robert Moses will not be able to reconstitute physically for days, and if his body is destroyed, and his phylactery is destroyed, he will be permanently unmade. But you don't have the whole phylactery, you only have this little bitty beginning of a rune."
"Ally: I take a ton of photos and send it to the group, including Alejandro, so maybe he can—"
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Do some work on that or tell me what to look for in this office.
"Brennan: Awesome. Yeah, you see Alejandro texts back and says,"
Alejandro: I will begin to research immediately.
"Brennan: You see Alejandro's getting, goes,"
"Alejandro: Holy shit, we have the beginning of the rune sequence of Robert Moses's phylactery."
"Kingston: Bam. Okay, Pete!"
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"Alejandro: [eating chopped cheese] God, this is so good."
Kingston: It's very good.
"Alejandro: You know, when there's a fight about to happen, it's like, you can sort of pile on the calories 'cause you're going to be--"
"Kingston: Right, we gonna burn all this off."
[Emily laughs]
Ricky: Can you ask Alejandro if he can identify things through a picture?
"Brennan: [laughs] You see she texts on your phone, Alejandro texts back a little gif of someone doing, he texts back that Robert Redford gif of him doing the slow nod."
[Emily laughs]
Zac: From Jeremiah Johnson?

"Brennan: [laughs] The Jeremiah Johnson one. And you see that he says,"
Alejandro: Ana and Amelia told me how to use [pronounced with a “j” sound] gifs.
Kingston: What's a gif?
"Alejandro: A gif is like a little movie, but it's like for a joke, it's a sassy kind of—"
"Kingston: I don't get it, why don't people just say what they mean, you know?"
"Alejandro: Kingston, you know, you're younger than me, you could live—"
Kingston: I don't—
Alejandro: We could all die tonight! You have to enjoy life a little bit!
"Kingston: I enjoy life perfectly fine, I just don't need little movies to do it."
"Alejandro: You are the Vox Populi of New York City, which means you speak on behalf of its people. And do you know what I think?"
"Kingston: What do you think, Alejandro?"
Alejandro: There is one person in New York who you have always refused to speak for. And I'm looking right at him.
[ethereal music]
Kingston: Get out of here.
Alejandro: I'm not going to get out of here!
"Kingston: Okay, what, because I won't use gifs?"
Alejandro: Because you won't use a gif to have a good time!
Kingston: Okay.
Alejandro: That's what I think!
Kingston: Okay.
"Alejandro: That's my, that's one man's opinion."
Kingston: All right.
"Alejandro: Okay, so—"
Lou: How much time do we have left?
"Brennan: You, it's probably, for you it's probably right around 9:50."
Lou: Can I head uptown?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can absolutely, you get on your bus. Alejandro says,"
"Alejandro: Okay, I'm gonna go research this. Hey, whatever this is, I approve."
Kingston: Get out of here!
Alejandro: Okay!
Brennan: He gives you a little golden eyed wink. [ding]
Kingston: Get out of here!
"Alejandro: I'm 94, I can have a fun time if I want! [wiggling his shoulders]"
Kingston: Okay.
Brennan: You see that he heads up into the library.
Ally and Emily both mimic Alejandro’s shoulder wiggle move. Emily is laughing.
Brennan: You guys— Rad.
"Siobhan: I feel like this is Pete's new look. It's a cantrip you can cast it whenever you want, you're just like—"
Brennan: Dope as hell.
Zac: Keith would get implants of— [mimics fangs]
Siobhan: Absolutely.
Ally: Absolutely would.
Brennan: Keith?
Ally: Keith from Buzzfeed.
"Brennan: The Maserati pulls in right outside of Yankee Stadium, you see that mist kind of flows around it. You hear the questing blade go, [eerie music]"
"Axe: [deep, British accent] it has chosen this place to appear."
Zac: What has chosen this place?
"Axe: The Hall, the Hall of Heroes descends now."
"Brennan: You see that Esther goes,"
"Esther: Are you, is your ax talking to you? The questing blade."
"Ricky: [holding the axe like a phone, puts it down to talk to Esther] Sorry. It said this is the place where the Hall of Heroes has chosen to appear."
"Brennan: You see that Esther texts that out, you see that not that anyone's still there anymore, [laughs] but you see that Alejandro goes into, or Alejandro texts everyone back, he says,"
"Alejandro: Jackson would like everyone to know that he thinks it's bullshit that the Hall of Heroes is appearing at Yankee Stadium. And I quote, go Mets."
Ricky: I think that's very honorable that you support your team in that way.
"Brennan: You see that, you know, it's nighttime, but the doors open, you see a spectral figure appear. First with this gleaming silver of a questing blade, and you see that a questing baseball bat appears in the air, and you see the Bambino himself, Babe Ruth tips his cap to you and goes,"
"Babe Ruth: [raspy, old-timey voice] Holy shit, pal! Look at you! What do you got, you're built like a brick house!"
Zac: I sort of just bow to him.
Emily: Aww!
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Babe Ruth: As one member of the Order to another,"
"Brennan: And bows to you. He goes,"
"Babe Ruth: Come on in, champion."
"Brennan: You see that Esther goes to follow and he says,"
"Babe Ruth: I'm sorry, my lady, but champions only beyond this point."
"Brennan: She looks out at the Maserati and goes,"
"Esther: Fuck, okay, fine. Wicked. [laughs]"
"Brennan: As he walks with you, you see that Esther conjures a weird little spectral eye and just sends it in after you and is like,"
Esther: I'm gonna fuckin' do what I want. Fuckin' Babe Ruth.
"Emily: Yeah, girl. Take down that boys club!"
"Siobhan: Don't tell me what to do, Babe Ruth!"
Lou: The patriarchy ends today!
"Brennan: You see that Babe Ruth walks through Yankee Stadium with you and says,"
"Babe Ruth: How you holding up, kiddo, you all right?"
"Ricky: I think I'm doing okay, I just… There's a lot happening right now, and I'm worried we won't be able to help everybody."
[ambient music]
"Babe Ruth: The Hall of Heroes is always stood, it and its questing blades to protect those shining beacons of hope and civilization, you know? People have always liked to talk a lot of shit about this town. Just like they did about London and Rome and Ur long before."
"Brennan: You see these visions of other cities in the past, and these various people holding questing blades aloft. You see Camelot appears and these other place where people hold these shining weapons aloft."
Ricky: Awesome.
"Brennan: He walks out into Yankee Stadium and you're just in the, just on the field now. And you see he says,"
"Babe Ruth: I wanted you to come out here and meet the rest of your Order. You know, there's the glitz and the glamor and the madness and the dream realm, but there is a power here to the waking world as well. Even the [points to himself] Sultan of Swat knows that."
"Brennan: You see he look out and says,"
"Babe Ruth: Places like this have as much heart as anywhere else, because of people like us. Go out there and get the work done."
"Brennan: He kind of pokes your thick chest as he does it. And you see he says,"
"Babe Ruth: So, it's time for you to receive your blessing here in the Hall of Heroes. [reverberating, announcer-like shout] Heroes!"
"Brennan: And you see there's a flicker, and you see an image of Lou Gehrig out in the middle of the field going like, [whispering]"
"Lou Gehrig: Today, I consider myself the luckiest man... [imitates whooshing]"
Zac: Just starts crying.
"Brennan: He's crying! You see Babe starts crying as well, and salutes Lou. And you see that, walking out of the mist, you see an old man with a mustache and a little pilot's pin comes out and he goes,"
"Sullenberger: Hi, I'm Sully Sullenberger. The hero—"
Ricky: Are you dead?
Sullenberger: No. No.
Ricky: Are you really here?
"Sullenberger: No, this is my ghost, but I'm also still alive."
Murph: Zero questions from Ricky.
"Brennan: You see that also he goes,"
"Sullenberger: If I can land that plane, you can save this city from the apocalypse. You see that—"
Ricky: Are we against geese? I'm just making sure.
Sullenberger: You are against Robert Moses. And I was against geese. Different heroes have different enemies.
"Ricky: So wait, are you telling me that those geese were knowingly flying into those jet engines?"
"Brennan: You see that he holds a silvery pilot yoke, like a yoke of a plane aloft. And you see that there's an image of a group of hooded geese going,"
"Geese: [deep, evil voice] Tomorrow we strike! Though we shall not all survive, we shall destroy Sullenberger once and for all."
Ricky: Wow.
"Brennan: You see that two other figures come out of the mist. So it's Babe Ruth, Sully Sullenberger, and you see Carl Sagan holding a silver telescope, and Ruth Bader Ginsberg holding a silver gavel all walk out. You see they say, you see that they both nod,"
"Ginsburg: Hello, I'm also still alive."
"Brennan: And you see Carl Sagan says,"
"Sagan: I'm not. But I can recognize someone who has devoted themselves to a better world. And it begins here, my fellow passenger on Spaceship Earth."
Ricky: We're on a spaceship.
[Brennan laughs]
"Brennan: You see that Babe looks out and says,"
"Babe Ruth: The champions of the Hall of Heroes have always stood to do what must be done, even at great cost to themselves. You hold the questing blade. And this blessing is yours, if you'd claim it."
[ethereal music]
Babe Ruth: Do you claim this blessing?
Ricky: I shall claim it.
"Babe Ruth: Right. To perform the ritual, you've got to play a little game of catch."
Ricky: We have to? Or get to?
"Brennan: See he says,"
"Babe Ruth: All right. Head on out there, Rick."
"Brennan: And you see he tosses a ball to you. Cool. You, Babe Ruth, Sully Sullenberger, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, and Carl Sagan play a little bit of catch."
Siobhan: What position is Ruth Bader Ginsberg in?
"Ally: I was like, don't make Ruth catch anything. Preserve Ruth."
Lou: Preserve.
Siobhan: She breaks all the bones in her body.
Ally: Put Ruth in amber now!
"Brennan: You see that they place a blessing in the questing blade as you guys play catch. I'm gonna hand this to you, and I'm gonna ask you to not read it aloud, but read it only to yourself."
Zac: Okay.
"Emily: [holding her hands between herself and Zac] I wouldn't not be, even I want to so bad."
Lou: Everybody look at his face through.
"Ally: I just want to say if, at the time that this airs, Ruth Bader Ginsberg has passed—"
"Emily: Oh God, if we, I have been thinking that."
Ally: The saddest thing ever. I love you. You are an inspiration.
Emily: Motherfuckers.
"Siobhan: We love you, Ruth."
"Brennan: Dope. After a few minutes, you walk back out of there. And you see that Babe Ruth, all of them hold their questing blades aloft."
"Babe Ruth: Take care, Ricky Matsui."
"Ricky: Thank you, heroes."
"Brennan: [laughs] They fade into the mist. You walk from Yankee Stadium, and you see that Esther says,"
Esther: All good?
Ricky: Great.
Esther: Good.
"Ricky: Awesome. Should we, yeah, let's get out of here."
Esther: Let's get out of here. [imitates car revving]
Brennan: You guys take off. Wonderful.
Ally: Can I do something really quick?
Brennan: Yeah!
Ally: Is Financial District near Times Square?
Brennan: No. Farther away.
Ally: I wanted to hang up posters in Times Square advertising for other parties to get people not to show up there.
"Siobhan: I mean, they've been there for 12 hours. People wear diapers and shit."
Brennan: You can absolutely just summon a bunch of dream paper if you want to start—
"Ally: Okay, yeah. I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna advertise for two very different parties. One is gonna be—"
Emily: Lower East Side.
"Ally: Meet the cast of SNL and Fun Home live at this address that's way across town. And then the other one is unlimited drugs warehouse all night party, a completely different address in a different area. Flyers go everywhere all over Times Square."
Emily: I think you just got yourself on the nice list. That’s an act of true heroism.
"Brennan: What was the second party, sorry?"
"Ally: It was unlimited drugs, all night, back to back famous underground DJs."
"Brennan: In-fucking-credible. So I'm gonna cut now over to, buh-buh-buh. Sofia."
"Emily: Yeah. Okay, so I show up to the Empire State Building."
"Brennan: You see it's, the observation deck is closed."
"Emily: That's fine, I'm not going inside. And then I'm just gonna Otherworldly Leap myself and try to, ideally what I'd like to do is I'd like to climb it like a rock climber."
"Brennan: You, bah, just scale with pure force of will. [clanking noises] Give me an Athletics check. With Otherworldly Leap we'll say with advantage with Otherworldly Leap."
Emily: Okay. 19.
[sound of clawing on metal]
"Brennan: You fully scale the Empire State Building. Storm clouds, [imitates rumbling thunder] roiling, strange color, green and purple lightning."
[imitates lightning cracks]
"Emily: Okay. I'm just gonna say,"
"Sofia: Okay, all you sphinxes and you choosers of the Chosen of the Concrete Fist, you weren't there for my husband Dale, and look what that got him. So I don't really care about being your chosen. Honestly, I know that this is probably an off-putting way to do this, but I don't give a shit about being your chosen. I'm honestly just trying to fuck some shit up tonight. Death has no fear for me. I'll die easily, I'm on the nice list, I'll go get to be with my husband. It'll be fucking dope. So just choose me for the fucking night. You let Dale down, now show the fuck up."
[imitates whistling wind]
Brennan: [whispers] Make a Perception check.
Emily: 12.
Brennan: You look around. Nothing but the wind howls up here.
"Emily: All right, I'll go to the other side."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: Are there any other, are there any gargoyles or anything adorning the top of the Empire State Building?"
Brennan: Make an Investigation check.
"Emily: Mm, 13."
Brennan: No. There's no gargoyles up here.
Siobhan: [whispering] Go to the top.
Emily: Am I not at the top?
Brennan: You're at the observation deck.
"Emily: Oh, I meant to go to the top. I want to go to the very fuckin' top."
Brennan: Give me another athletics check.
"Emily: Kay. Ooh, 13."
"Brennan: You, takes a long time getting up there. And you so poured your heart out into that statement and then for it to be met with silence is so brutal. Sofia, where's Sofia at right now as she gets, you perch like fuckin', you're like—"
"Sofia: I'm just determined. I don't fuckin' care, I'm really, right now, I feel like I'm dealing with fuckin' cowards, and I think they need to show themselves. Because honestly, if you don't fuckin' show up now, there might not be anyone to fuckin' choose ever again. So then you'll have had this little gift you could have given to someone, this little choosing you could have done, and you will never do it to anyone. It's like letting food go bad, I hate when people let food go bad!"
[imitates wind whistling]
"Brennan: You look out. You know, Sofia was raised in a very conflictful home. And for you to be pouring your rage out and to not be met with anything, is so maddening at this moment. You're filled with determination. Go ahead and make an Insight check for me."
Emily: 14.
"Brennan: You look down and see all the busy people in New York, moving to and fro. You see all of them waiting for a lucky break, all of them with these dreams and, you think about what Jackson said about the realm of dreams and Pete and Kingston and what they represent, and this weird schism in this place where people come to pursue some completely lofty, far away goal, and yet life from day to day can be so dreary and miserable and hard. And the gap from dream to reality feels insurmountable."
Emily: All right.
Brennan: You look around and you also remember Dale's words to you.
Emily: It is what it is.
Brennan: That's not what Dale said.
"Emily: Oh, at the top, what did he say? He said, at the top—"
"Siobhan: It's gonna feel like there's not anybody there, but there is, there is somebody there."
"Emily: Mm. All right. So at the top, it's gonna feel like there's no one there, but there is someone there. So I guess I'll just kind of be like,"
"Sofia: All right. If this is how we're doing it, this is how we're doing it."
Emily: And I'll just basically meditate here until I gotta go to Times Square.
Siobhan makes a strained squeak at Emily. She knows something.
Emily: [to Siobhan] What? I don't have any spells.
"Brennan: You start meditating, you enter your meditative trance, you, the techniques you learned at the monastery. Ooh. You are standing on one foot on top of the spire at the top of the Empire State Building. You look down at New York. Dale believed there was something here. [ethereal music] Roll an insight check with advantage as you meditate."
Emily: Nat 20. And a 19.
"Siobhan: Fuck, man."
"[ethereal, humming music]"
"Brennan: You look out, what Dale believed was that Jackson's interpretation of the monks' mission was maybe not fully correct, the monks are from the waking world. But the idea of the dream being something they have to oppose, he didn't agree with by coming here to seek it out. He thought, just in the same way that yin and yang are opposed but complementary, that these two forces here were as well. And you've seen what happens when Pete and Kingston's magic works together. The nat 20 insight. You look at all those people down there. And a true born and bred New Yorker, you look down and realize that all the dreams that are being chased down there, that the true spirit of this place is to meet dreams with concrete, to hustle in the muck and the grime and grind a way to make something miraculous happen, in that the spirit of this place is that these people make it happen for themselves. You look around. Who is here at the top of the Empire State Building?"
Sofia: Motherfuckin' I'm here.
"Brennan: Fwoom, you open your eyes and look around. [sound of rumbling] Potential crackles in the air around you."
Emily: [whispers] Am I supposed to do something? What am I supposed to do?
"Brennan: You see that potential crackles in the air around you, a reverberation leaves and surrounds you as you say, I'm here. And you can feel Dale smiling down on you. [imitates whistling wind] There is someone at the top of the Empire State Building."
Emily: I put my hand out.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Emily: For, if there's anyone else."
Brennan: There's nobody else.
Emily: All right. What am I not getting? What the fuck am I not getting? Everyone's looking at me like I'm supposed to do something.
"Brennan: No, no, no. You see that, yeah. On that nat 20, when you said, I'm here—"
Ally: It's the worst feeling ever!
"Brennan: No, no, no."
Emily: I feel like everyone's like—
"Brennan: No, no, no, no."
Emily: What?
"Ally is staring intensely at Emily, grinning and rocking back and forth in their seat."
"Brennan: As you're saying I'm here, you never saw these scrolls, but in all the things that Jackson described, it was never clear who the spirits were that select the chosen one. And the scrolls never mentioned who they were, so there's no, no one knows who picks the chosen one."
Sofia: Okay. So I guess I just choose myself to be the chosen one?
Brennan: Boom! [sound of explosion]
[crackling explosions]
"Brennan: You are filled with power, you hear a purring in your heart, [imitates purring], the claws [shing!] appear at your side. There is nothing more in the spirit of this place than to rely on nobody else but yourself to decide that you will be chosen."
"Emily: All right, fuck yeah."
Brennan: [laughs] I'm going to go ahead.
Brennan gives Emily an item card.
Emily: This is a secret one?
"Brennan: You don't have to tell anybody, but you're also welcome to if you'd like."
Emily: Woo-hoo!
Ally: Is it a secret one?
Brennan: You—
"Ally: Oh, we're not here, I guess."
Brennan: You are filled with power—
"Emily: Honestly, it's not that thrilling, I can just, I can replenish a ki point each time you are dealt damage."
Ally: Nice!
"Siobhan: Oh, that’s sick."
"Emily: So I'm telling you guys, 'cause there wouldn't be a big reveal, but it's dope."
"Brennan: You also feel that there is another element even beyond that, that you, you can actually make an Arcana check to see if you understand the secondary power."
"Emily rolls the die, then looks at her roll dismissively and shakes her head a little."
"Brennan: So you, but you do feel another power that you know somebody more magical than you could probably identify or see."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: But you have, here at the top of the Empire State Building, the ultimate, there was no authority higher than your own, and nobody would have been as meaningful to select yourself as you."
"Emily: Yeah! Get it, bitch!"
Brennan: You can—
Ally: It's beautiful.
"Brennan: [laughs] You hear a voice on the wind say,"
"Dale: [whispering] I love you, I'm so proud of you. This is even more beautiful than the deer in the backyard."
"Sofia: Oh my God, I thought it was me talking to myself for a second until you said the deer. Dale! I'm coming for you! I'm coming for you, Dale!"
"Brennan: Cool, you head off. Kingston."
Lou: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: You make your way uptown. You arrive at the hospital. Emiko greets you at the door,"
"Emiko: Hey Kingston, stable for the moment. She's actually conscious, she's awake. Whatever you did, do you want the room to yourself?"
"Kingston: Yeah, just for a minute."
"Brennan: You walk into the room, beep, beep, beep. Liz is there."
[sighs]
"Kingston: How you doing, Ms. Herrera?"
"Liz: Fuck you. [heart monitor beeping] You did this, you saved me?"
"Kingston: It wasn't actually me, it was actually, you know Mr. March from the fireman calendar?"
"Liz: Mr. March? Oh my God, yeah."
"Kingston: Yeah, it was him. I helped, but he did most of the heavy lifting."
"Brennan: You see she goes,"
"Liz: Wow, well feel free to give him my number."
Kingston: All right.
"Brennan: You see, she looks out and goes,"
"Liz: What happened, some fuckin' bitch in a fuckin' pantsuit jumped me."
Kingston: Yeah.
Liz: It was awful.
"Kingston: It was a vampire, you know. It's a big old politician-slash-finance guy who's been alive for 400 years, he's a lich, he sold his soul. Fae and, you know. All the, same ol' bullshit."
"Liz: Well, looks like I got my fuckin' legs broke, 'cause I'm an extra in your story."
"Kingston: Okay. I… I mean, I don't know what to say, Liz. This wasn't supposed to happen to you. And I promise you, you know, my other friend, the person who did this to you tried to turn into a gas, and this person still beat the shit out of them. So they got what was coming to 'em."
"Liz: Honestly? I'm very happy to hear that, I want that fuckin' lady stopped."
Kingston: I thought you would.
"Liz: [sighs] So what, this is it, we're all gonna die and there's an apocalypse, something's gonna happen?"
"Kingston: Well, you know, I'mma try and do my best to stop it, but—"
"Liz: Oh, your best has always been pretty good, Kingston."
"Kingston: Oh, well."
Liz: Why'd you come up here?
"Kingston: Yeah, I don't know. Just thought I'd, you know, we've got to put it all out there. You just, you want to make sure that you got a chance to say everything that you wanted to say and be everywhere you wanted to be."
Liz: You want to be here with me?
"Kingston: Ah, I guess so, well, really I just want to show up and, you know, tell you how I saved you real quick."
"Brennan: You see she laughs, painfully. She looks and goes, make a Persuasion and an Insight roll for me, if you'd be so kind."
Lou: Persuasion and an Insight roll?
Brennan: Huh?
Lou: And an insight roll.
Brennan: Yep.
"Lou: Okay, insight first. That's gonna be a 28. Persuasion, Nat 20."
[Brennan laughs in incredulous shock for a second]
"Brennan: She begins to, she begins to weep a little bit, there. She's like,"
"Liz: It fuckin' hurts, you're making me laugh."
"Brennan: You look at her, she looks back at you. She knows that you can already tell this, just by looking at her. But it's been a long time for her to say it. You see she says,"
"Liz: You know, I think everybody deep down wants somebody as a partner that would, that you know would lay down their life for you. And when I met you, I knew you would do that for me. And then I figured out that the reason you would do that for me is because you'd do it for anybody. That's what a hero is. Makes me feel kinda selfish, you know? You want to be someone's everything, and you're everybody's everything. Made it real hard to feel special. And I feel like a piece of shit for wanting to feel special, 'cause you're the most selfless person I've ever known."
"Kingston: No, no."
Liz: I don't want to take up any more of your time. People need you.
"Kingston: Well, hey. I mean, I can't visit everybody. That's also because not everybody's worth visiting."
"Brennan: You say that, and she looks up and, again, what had for a moment stopped just starts streaming down her eyes."
"Liz: That’s such a bitchy thing to say, and it means the world."
"Kingston: Liz, you are, I mean, I don't know else to say it, but you, you were everything to me. Just because I have to be something for everybody doesn't mean I can't be something more for you. And I'm sorry that I didn't find that space in which to do that. And I'll spend the rest of my life wishing that I could have done it right. But, you know. Who knows? Rest of my life maybe won't be too much more, so I ain't got much more time to worry about it, so."
Brennan: She thinks long and hard about what you've said.
"Liz: There is something that you and I have always shared, we got thick heads, and we're pretty stubborn. And I think now, after a long, long time, I think it's safe to say we probably share something else too. You're not the only person that has regrets."
Kingston and Liz share a long look.
Liz: You gotta go.
"Kingston: Yeah, I should. You going anywhere?"
Liz: [laughs] Ow!
"Kingston: I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, that's on me."
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Liz: If somebody would fuckin' teach me how to do magic, I'd come help you whoop ass. I'm from the fuckin' Bronx."
"Kingston: Okay, okay. Well, we can talk about that if the world's still around tomorrow."
"Liz: If the world's still around, I'd love to talk."
Kingston: Great.
Brennan: Kingston leaves the hospital.
Lou: Can I head home?
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Lou: Can I, you know, sneak into my parents' room?"
Brennan: Mm-hmm?
Lou: Kiss 'em both on the forehead?
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Lou: I don't know if, I'm assuming they're awake, actually."
"Brennan: Oh yeah. Yeah, you sneak into their home, you see they're getting ready, they have the, they have some tea made and watching the ball drop."
"Kingston: Yeah. Hey, I'm headed downtown for the thing, so I just wanted to, you know, tell you I love you."
"Victoria: Kingston, I love you so much, come here!"
"Brennan: You see she comes over, mwah, kisses you. Tupperware full of muffins in the coat pocket."
"Kingston: Okay, and you know, I'll give these to somebody."
"Brennan: You see that your pop comes over and goes,"
"Winston: Very well, be headed downtown."
Kingston: Big day.
"Winston: Big day, huh? You on call, paramedic, is it all the people down there?"
"Kingston: Yeah, something like that."
"Winston: Something like that. [sighs] All right. Well, be careful down there, all right?"
"Kingston: You know I will. Hey, and pop?"
Winston: Mm-hmm?
Kingston: You gotta give that $400 back to Pete that he lost on Christmas during dominoes. You can't keep that money from him.
Winston: What? I won that money fair and square.
"Kingston: You have to give it back to him! He didn't know, he don't play dominoes with black people, he didn't have a chance. He didn't have a goddamn chance!"
"Winston: Oh, so if someone comes in and they're fool enough, he's got writing on his fingers, I can't school a young man in a game of dominoes?"
"Kingston: You know what? It's a big night, this is not the last conversation I want to have with you, I love you, pop."
"Wisnton: I love you too, you tell that boy if he wants to come learn some more, he can come by and play dominoes anytime he likes."
"Kingston: Okay, all right."
Lou: And then can I head upstairs real quick. Flip the frame on top of the refrigerator up.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Lou: Hit Cosmo's for one last cup of coffee, and head downtown."
Cosmo: Kingston Brown. Cup of coffee.
"Kingston: Thank you, Cosmo."
Brennan: It is hot and it tastes good.
Lou: Ooh.
"Brennan: You head downtown. You get down from the Empire State Building, where is everyone headed, so Ricky and Esther get back to the Occult Society?"
Emily: I'm gonna be jumping rooftop to rooftop to get to Times Square so I won't be getting down.
"Brennan: Gotcha, boom-boom-boom."
"Emily: But I have cell phone service up here, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, you do. So you're like, I'm on my way."
Emily: Cool.
"Brennan: Rowan, you're heading over from, you're taking the seven?"
"Siobhan: Actually, is there a dragon train that goes to Times Square?"
Brennan: Oh fuck yeah.
"Siobhan: So I don't have to take the seven? Great, then I will do that."
Brennan: You go up to one of the dragons.
"[Dragon screeches infernally, snarls, growls]"
Rowan: You're so cute. [pats it]
[Dragon panting]
"Brennan: You crawl into its body. Vwoom, rockets up."
"Siobhan: As I'm going, I want to text every fuckin' Broadway superstar, I'm texting Sondheim, I'm texting Bernadette Peters, I'm texting Audra McDonald, any goddamn person that I can think of to be like, the theater as we know it is under threat. Come to Times Square immediately."
"Emily: But aren't they all like, who is this no-name texting me?"
"Ally: I was gonna say, is this from a dead person's number?"
Siobhan: Also it's coming from Misty Moore's number.
[Brennan laughs]
Ally: Wow.
"Siobhan: And also Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin, 'cause they're gonna be in Times Square doing their, and Andersoon Cooper, there's definitely something magical about him. Nobody's hair is that white at that young of an age. It's not for some kind of—"
Brennan: Anderson Cooper is canon fae in this universe.
"Siobhan: Fantastic, yeah. The Rockefellers are all up there."
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: You shoot off, you… You get texts back from, not everyone texts back right away. Stephen Sondheim texts you back immediately."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: You see that the text just says,"
Sondheim: The plot thickens… Ms. Berry. ;)
Rowan: Love you!
Emily: I also want to text Mario.
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: And say,"
"Sofia: If you want to redeem yourself, you can, we're going after your boy Robert Moses in Times Square."
"Brennan: You, there's a pause. You get a text back."
Mario: On our way.
"Siobhan: Great. Oh, and Em as well, I would love to text Em, just to make sure that she's—"
Emily: I don't know if that helped or hurt.
"Siobhan: Oh, and Don Confetti as well."
Emily: I don't know if Mario's gonna be on our side.
Siobhan: Fuckin' Don Confetti.
"Brennan: Cool, you text—"
"Lou: I text Willy, I tell him to get his ass to Times Square."
Brennan: Incredible.
Siobhan: What about magical butt guy?
Brennan: Lowell Masters?
"Lou: I mean, Lowell's—"
Siobhan: Maybe he can—
"Ally: Yeah, hell yeah!"
"Lou: Are that he can put things up his ass and identify them, I feel like—"
Zac: Does he have anything that he could—
"Siobhan: Yeah, maybe he can bring some shit down?"
"Brennan: Kingston, are you heading right to Times Square?"
Lou: I think I'll hit the Gramercy Occult—
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: And walk over with—
"Brennan: With, cool. So yeah. So Esther, Ricky, Kingston, and Alejandro all just start walking over from the Gramercy Occult Society, you actually got some other texts. Pete, you grab your flyers and head to Times Square."
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: You just start flyering every—
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: As much you can. Kugrash, you're trying to get back from Forest Hills. How are you doing that?"
"Murph: I guess I have to, how long is a short rest, could I potentially, obviously you burn your hit dice each short rest, but could I potentially do another one to get a Wild Shape back if I fly back?"
"Brennan: Yes, I'll allow you to go ahead and do that."
"Murph: Sweet, then I have to, I tell David,"
"Kugrash: Yeah, so, we'll catch up later, hopefully after tonight you won't be a vampire anymore. But for now, you're a vampire. So, if uh, feel like you want more than just a steak, maybe chill out. Maybe spend a quiet night at home."
"David: Oh, I will be careful. I will be careful."
"Brennan: You get back to the Gramercy Occult Society, you see the steps, you see the horror, you know the bodies, which now are being partially cleaned up. You also see Esther casting an Identify spell, partially on the Maserati and some other magical stuff, but they're like, she and Alejandro are considering bringing to the fight with them."
Murph: Got it.
"Ally: Oh, yeah, let's get a Maserati at the fight."
Siobhan: Awaken the Maserati!
"Kugrash: Hey Esther, would you mind taking a look at my crown here?"
"Brennan: You see she goes,"
"Esther: Oh, sure Kugrash, yeah. Yeah, I can take a look at that."
"Brennan: She, [imitates humming] casts Identify on it. [ethereal music] The stuff you already know."
Murph: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: And the ability past that. She looks at it and goes,"
Esther: There's a powerful… There's a powerful curse breaker in here.
Siobhan: [whispering] Oh shit.
"Esther: Because the crown, any human that wears the crown quickly turns into a rat, there is a powerful spell energy locked in here that,"
"Brennan: And you see that she kind of gets choked up for a second, and steels herself, like."
Esther: [sharply breathing] It's a powerful spell energy that can break extremely powerful curses.
[ethereal music]
"Murph: I nod. Do you, why, I guess can I do an Insight check--"
"Brennan: Yeah, do an insight, yeah."
Murph: I probably saw that she was upset. 20— something. 24.
"Brennan: You look at her and she says,"
"Esther: I've just never seen, I've just never seen a curse breaking that powerful."
Kugrash: Is there something personal to you that you--
"Esther: You said you knew my mom, right?"
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Esther: My family's been cursed for a long time. We have certain… We've been cursed for a long time. And my mom has been out of my life for a long time as a result of that curse. She was betrayed by someone very close to her, and it took her away from me, my dad, family."
"Kugrash: [very strained] This probably isn't the best time, but that was me."
Esther: What?
"Sofia: [whispers] Don't make her emotional! I know, I know you're right, it's good. I'm sorry."
"Kugrash: I… If whatever happened to her was because somebody betrayed her, then it might have been me. We used to work together. And, I wasn't a good guy. She turned me into a rat, because I'm a rat. But I want you to know that I would like to use the crown to help her. My son is also a vampire, so I might need to use it on him. But I'm willing to spend the rest of my life as a rat if it means I can help your mom. Or you can help my son, so I'm, I'm sorry, I can only do, I can only try to do good things, I can't fix what I did."
"Brennan: You see, she looks at you, Ricky and says,"
"Esther: Ricky, can I borrow the Maserati?"
"Ricky: Of course just, you know, the seat belt and all that."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: You see she, you see—"
"Ricky: I can't help myself sometimes, I'm sorry."
"Brennan: You see that Esther, Esther gets into the Maserati with, and she opens up the suicide doors, and says,"
Esther: Get in.
Kugrash: All right. All right!
"Ally: None of us are here, bro. [laughs]"
"Brennan: You see that Esther looks at Alejandro, Ricky, and Kingston and says,"
"Esther: If you walk over, I'll be there in time."
"Kingston: Hey, just don't be late. This is big stuff."
"Esther: I understand, I understand. I do understand."
Sofia: I think this is good.
Ally: Kugrash.
"Brennan: You see she peels off in the Maserati. [sound of engine revving] She is going,"
"Esther: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck."
Brennan: And starts crying a little bit and you see some like...
"Kugrash: No, it's all good! We're good! [laughs]"
"Brennan: You're, that Insight check you rolled was very high."
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: Her emotion is sorrow. Other strong emotions will not trigger her curse.
"Emily: Oh, good."
"Murph: Got it, okay."
Brennan: But it looks like she's feeling some kind of sorrow right now.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: So she's driving. [imitates engine revving]
Esther: Oh God.
"Kugrash: It's all good. We're, you know, we're gonna figure this out, we got the crown, that's good, right?"
"Brennan: You see that the flood of emotion has brought back all of the years she lost and the life she lost. And you can see her starting to change, as she drives the car. As the sorrow keeps setting in, she's driving and driving."
"Kugrash: You know, look, your mom was a great person, I know you didn't get to be around her much."
Brennan: That's just making her sadder.
Murph: Fuck!
"Emily: Change your subject, pivot!"
Murph: That doesn't—
Siobhan: Sing a song!
Zac: Be an asshole.
"Ally: Yeah, exactly, another--"
Emily: Ooh.
"Murph: I, fuck, I'll use, this is a bad idea, I'm gonna use my last fuckin' Wild Shape of the day and I turn into a golden retriever and lick her face."
Brennan: Give me a Persuasion check.
"Murph: Goddammit, I'm so--"
"Siobhan: With advantage, 'cause he's so cute?"
"Brennan: I'll say with advantage, 'cause you're so cute."
"Murph: Oh, can I have dog stats now? 'Cause I have a minus two, 'cause I'm a rat. Fuck."
[suspenseful music]
Murph: With my persuasion a 13.
"Brennan: Okay, 13. You lick her face, it's slightly enough, she's, [sound of tires squealing] you see she's pulling up to Tompkins Square. But yeah, it doesn't look like, it doesn't look like it's working that well."
[Ally laughs]
Murph: Dammit.
Brennan: What does Kugrash do?
Murph: Oh my God.
"Brennan: You see she sinks into her seat, and her eyes start to go silvery, milky. [raspy breathing]"
"Kugrash: All right. Gabby, I, fuck."
"Zac: Do we know, are we texting at all right now?"
"Ally: Yeah, fully. [laughs]"
Zac: Just like—
Murph: I—
"Zac: That's like, you know that it's a curse on her whole family, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: Just wondering.
"Kugrash: All right. Oh fuckin', I'm sorry, David, I gotta let you down again."
Murph: And I cast the Remove Curse on her.
"Brennan: Cool. You get to Tompkins Square Park, you see at the edge of the park her mother and grandmother float out, and you see, as she stumbles out of the car, you hold the crown on your head and [humming] [magical explosions] [gasps] Their eyes uncloud. You see Esther looks up at her mother and grandmother. Esther, weeping uncontrollably. Gabriella looks up at her daughter, looks at you, looks back at her daughter. The grotto, the trees just move to surround the Maserati. [laughs] And suck it into the park. She rushes and picks up her daughter, they look at each other, and just begin to weep and hold each other. Her mother is crying, holding her, kisses her on the head. And you see that Esther's sort of just kneeling, her head against her mom's stomach, her grandmother gently petting her shoulder. And all three women turn to look at you, no longer furious but instead three extremely powerful witches."
"Kugrash: Hey, Gabby. It's been a while. You know, you, in a weird way, you turning me into a rat kind of saved me. So I'm happy to get to kind of help you guys out."
"Gabriela: Bruce, you dumb motherfucker, you think I don't know how a fuckin' curse works?"
"Kugrash: All right, the Maserati's not me, I'm not that big of a douchebag anymore."
"Gabriela: You understand, I understand you learned your fucking little rat lesson."
Kugrash: All right.
"Gabriela: That's why I didn't kill you, I could have killed you."
"Kugrash: You know, I appreciate it. I kind of like being a rat now. Again, the Maserati's not mine, it's my friend's, it's actually, he doesn't, he's not a Maserati guy."
"Brennan: You see Esther's going,"
"Esther: [sobbing] It's Ricky's, he's so hot! I want to fuck him so bad!"
Emily: [clapping] Oh yay!
"Esther: [wails] I haven't been able to say it! Mom, he's so hot! He's got 20 abs!"
Murph: I'm recording this on video.
Gabriela: Shh-shh-shh-shh. [pets Esther’s head]
"Brennan: Gabby's like,"
"Gabriela: I know, I know. We, listen, we were the Furies of Tompkins Square Park, we saw all, we saw how hot he is."
"Brennan: You see that her grandmother says,"
"Patricia: [elderly voice] It's true, we saw, he's Mr. fuckin' March, you can't deny that."
"Brennan: Esther looks up, as she's weeping she's like,"
"Esther: Mom, I can't believe you're back!"
"Kugrash: Do we want to have a family reunion after we save the world? Do you guys all want to maybe go one last job, Gabby?"
"Brennan: You see that Gabriela looks at you and says, says,"
Gabriela: I'm going to catch up with my daughter. I've earned that.
"Brennan: And you see that the grandmother looks at you and says,"
"Patricia: Patricia, nice to— we met I think at a holiday party."
"Kugrash: Oh God, that just makes it, yes, I remember you. Goddamn it, I'm a rat."
"Patricia: Before I became this, but, just want to say, you'll have your, there's plenty that we can do."
Brennan: See [imitates crackling] lightning crackles from her fingers.
Patricia: Plenty we can do from here.
Murph: All right.
"Brennan: You see that Esther says,"
Esther: I'll be along. I can get there. You take the Maserati if you want.
"Kugrash: I mean, yeah, it's not my kind of car, but yeah, yeah."
"Murph: It is kind of Kugrash's kind of car, 'cause Bruce was that guy."
Ally: You're wearing the Rolex.
"Murph: I feel, yeah, I'm wearing the Rolex, and I go back in. And it is 1985 again."
"Brennan: You peel off to Times Square, you leave Esther weeping and with her mom and grandma, they hug each other. And you see the grandma says,"
"Patricia: All right, well! Looks like it's time to brew up something special for New Year's! [cackling laugh]"
"Brennan: And takes her little knobbly staff and starts doing something with it. You peel off, Ricky, Alejandro, Kingston, Rowan, you come surging out of the subway, Pete, you're flyering everywhere. Sofia on the rooftops, Kugrash, you whip up in the Maserati."
"Zac: I think I also ran up onto the rooftops, 'cause that's my thing as--"
"Siobhan: Oh, can I also figure out what is up with this crown, what it gives me, or I can ask Alejandro to—"
Brennan: You can ask Alejandro to—
"Rowan: Alejandro, what does this ball of silver do for me?"
"Brennan: You see that he goes,"
"Alejandro: Oh, that appears to be a token of your station, it looks like it doesn't have any specific powers, it has been melted down. But it should make it hard for, you know, fiends, celestials, fae to do things to you if you don't want them to."
Rowan: I probably don't want them to.
Brennan: You see that—
Rowan: So that's something.
"Brennan: You guys pull up, you hear, you know, Anderson and Kathy going,"
"Anderson and Kathy: Incredible night out here at New Year's, we're about to see the ball drop. Storm clouds are gathering overhead and sickly lightning in colors that we've never seen before are raking across the sky. Deeply unsettling as we enter into 2019, but what a festive occasion, here we go, Ms. Jackie Evancho!"
"Brennan: You see that people are singing, there's dancing, celebration. You hear, ten! Nine!"
Siobhan: Shit.
Brennan: Eight!
Emily: I'm gonna cast Otherworldly Leap…
Brennan: Seven! Six!
Emily: Right before it hits one.
Brennan: Otherworldly Leap.
"Lou: Can I pop this chocolate, this delicious semi-sweet chocolate?"
Brennan: Yes you can.
Zac: Do you have the time guns?
Brennan: Gobble it down!
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm gonna touch Ricky's abs and give him Freedom of Movement."
"Brennan: Ten, nine, eight, Five! Four! Three! Two! One! [imitates magical explosion] [sound of explosion] Happy New Year. The phylactery shatters. [sound of shattering] The time stone breaks. [imitates shattering] A tornado, wah, of raw smoke and red, green, and purple energy, [imitates crackling] surround, at the center of the hurricane's eye, the Golden Door opens. [sound of metal creaking] You see the American Dream begins to emerge. I'm gonna need everybody here to roll initiative."
Siobhan: Don't fail me now!
Brennan: That's all for this episode of The Unsleeping City! Tune in next time!

Brennan: The paragon that moves here beyond the Golden Door looks like many things.
Siobhan: I see choices.
Zac: Like an immigrant's journey.
Ally: He sees the process of his transition.
Lou: Kingston sees sacrifice.
"Murph: Having fun in their family, and he's not thinking about material things."
Emily: Sofia sees love. Just getting to love who you want.
[sound of rolling thunder]
American Dream: This… is a wicked place. I would see this changed.

[RECAP]
"Jackson: They're gonna try to pull it out of the dream realm, the Golden Door."
Sofia: Yeah.
Jackson: This is bad.
Ricky: We need to get everybody that we know in on this.
Brennan: David is…
Murph: Fuck!
"Brennan: Bitten on the neck. See Esther looks up, and her eyes start to go silvery milky. [gasps]"
"Kugrash: I’m sorry, David, I gotta let you down again."
Murph: And I cast the Remove Curse on her.
"Babe Ruth: You hold the questing blade. And this blessing is yours, if you’d claim it."
Ricky: I shall claim it.
Sofia: So I guess I just choose myself to be the chosen one?
Brennan: Boom! [explosion]
"Anderson and Kathy: Incredible night out here at New Year’s, we’re about to see the ball drop."
[people counting down]
Nod: There is a very real chance that the world will change forever tonight. This is as bad as it could be. This is the hour. This is it.
New Yorkers: [slowly] Happy New Year.
[magical explosion]
"Brennan: At the center of the hurricane’s eye, the Golden Door opens, you see the American Dream begins to emerge."
[END RECAP]
[intro music]
"Brennan: Welcome back, one and all to the climactic battle of The Unsleeping City! Our intrepid heroes, say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes."
"Brennan: Have found themselves back where it all started in Times Square, New Year's Eve. The ball drops, the time stone, fused with Robert's phylactery, [magical blast] as it hits and shatters, time suspends. The Umbral Arcana, seized and stopped by the sabotage of Robert's vampire minions, [whooshing] flickers and all of those unable to perceive the Unsleeping City are, whoom, whisked away whereas you, [whooshing] are seized in a maelstrom, orange and red and black smoke, the eye of a hurricane stretching up, boom, high above the Golden Door opens, the paragon emerges. You are within the spell powered by the time stone, this matrix of energy and force is both the same and intertwined and beside and behind of the power of Robert's phylactery, as his soul attempts to wrest the power of the paragon. You watch the Dream move to the threshold of the door. Beyond the threshold, the paragon that moves here beyond the Golden Door looks like many things. A flickering dream. Only that which the beholder would make of it. What do all of you see as you look at that dream before it crosses the threshold? Because none of you see the exact same thing."
Lou: This is our version of the American Dream?
"Brennan: That's correct. Prosperity, hope, what lies behind the Golden Door."
"Siobhan: I see choices, I think that that's the American Dream for Rowan, and for Misty and all of the people that I have been before, is the luxury of choice, of being who you want to be and also changing who you are."
[whooshing]
"Brennan: Freedom incarnate. All the various lives that you could have lived and will, if you are successful, get to. [whooshing] What does everyone else see?"
[soft music]
"Murph: I think Kugrash sees a… A time, he sees a time when he took his family to a baseball game. And they're all having fun in their family and he's not thinking about material things, but it's like, back in the 80s, and for that moment, he has his thing."
[bat clinking]
"Brennan: [singing] Ba-da-da-da, ba-da! Charge! [roaring crowd]"
[soft music]
Brennan: [quietly] What do the rest of you see?
"Zac: I think Ricky sees like an immigrant's journey, just like, coming to the United States and having the drive to make a better life for themselves."
"Brennan: Statue of Liberty, boat full of people dreaming of a better life. Early Christmas with your mom and dad, who are that story, of people who came here and made something of themselves and the life they made for you and your siblings."
[whoosh]
Brennan: [quietly] What else?
[soft music]
"Emily: Think Sofia sees love, just getting to love who you want, how you want, without other people getting in the way."
[whooshing]
"Brennan: You almost think you can see Dale moving as the shape of the dream, but many other people too, and the people that they would be free to love. Freedom. Again."
"Ally: I think Pete sees the process of his transition and how shocking it was, when a door would close and it would, someone would be like, we don't know what you're talking about, or that's not included in your insurance, people like his doctor that he loves, that's like, oh yeah, I can do that. [laughs]"
"Brennan: You see transformation, the ability to become who you know you are, and the people who have the courage to help you get there, and you see Lugash moving towards the door, smiling at you."
"Pete: Lugash, I wish you were magical, you're so strong!"
[Emily laughs]
"Lugash: [Russian accent] Peter, I am magical."
Pete: What?
"Lugash: I don't know, it feel right to say."
"Pete: Okay. [laughs] You're a liar, and so am I, so that's why we get along. [laughs]"
[Emily laughs]
"Lou: Kingston sees sacrifice, and, you know, mothers and fathers, toiling, working late hours so that their children and those people's children and their families can have the opportunities to thrive."
"Brennan: The Dream hits the threshold, boom. Kingston, the last thing you see are the flickering faces of all the people you have known who have made this a place worth living in. And that breaks [sound of cracking] and fades as it steps through, and must become one thing and one thing only. And you see the tendrils of Robert's spell, and the infection set in. The Dream warps, convulses, has its last moment where it could be anything… And begins to take a solid stationary form."
"[ominous, discordant music]"
"Siobhan: Please be Donald Trump, please be Donald Trump. [laughs]"
"Brennan: You see what had been many different forms becomes humanoid in shape, a beautiful man, tall..."
"Ally: No, no. How big are the hands?"
[Siobhan laughs]
Brennan: Quite big.
"Ally: Oh, okay."
Brennan brings out a mini of the American Dream.
Zac: Is that Stephen Sondheim?
"Brennan: No, it's not Stephen Sondheim."
Brennan: Wouldn't that be incredible if he was the villain the whole time?
Murph: Yeah.
"Ally: Ooh, that is..."
"Brennan: No, you guys see a tall, clean cut, square-jawed, blond haired, blue- eyed man, energy..."
Siobhan: It's the fucking Protestant work ethic.
"Brennan: Appears, hovering in the air above you. [whooshing] This shape and form, [whooshing] appears, floating in the air, and surveys the cracked sidewalks, the debris in New York has been sucked up into this, it's sidewalks and buildings and things, [whooshing] swirling, and fractal imaging collapsing and opening. This Dream appears in a single, solid form. It surveys what it can see of the city, the sidewalks, the subways, the buildings, the billboards, and in a resonant voice goes,"
"American Dream: [deep, echoing voice] This place is filthy. It stinks here of urine and excrement. Vomit. Decay. This is a wicked place. I would see this changed. [whooshing]"
Ally: It's Taxi Driver!
Siobhan: Mr. DeNiro… I'm a huge fan of your work!
Ally: [laughs] It's Robert DeNiro!
"Brennan: You guys see that, whoom, energy surrounds the Dream as, [explosions] two pillars of flame appear, [roaring fire] [sound of fire crackling] as well as wind-swept tornadoes full of refuse and garbage."
[whooshing]
Ally: Very cool. Very Katamari.
"Brennan: The Dream beholds you with neither menace nor cruelty, nor empathy, nor sorrow, nor in fact any recognition of any of your humanity or what role you could play outside of the designs of this being. We are going to start at the top of the initiative order with Kingston."
"Lou: Okay. Can I just start with just a, I like, aw, I mean, just a Perception check as to, so the nature of this, are we on an isolated, like..."
"Brennan: You guys are, without even making a Perception check, these platforms are kind of in the eye, that platform is actively whirling around the outside..."
Lou: This?
"Brennan: That one, yes."
"Lou: Okay. So we're on a, we're..."
"Brennan: You're in the eye of the fuckin' hurricane, you're on a chunk of building that is, whoosh, swirling around."
"Lou: Okay. In terms of our ability to, I don't know, would, is there, there's a potential for us to move from here to here?"
"Brennan: There is a potential, you're whipping around it, there's a potential to move there. It would require a jump or some other kind of spell or something."
"Lou: Okay, got it. Wow. Well, this is terrifying."
"Brennan: And you see that the whirlwind surrounding you, so here, the negative space, the sides, all of that, is a whirling vortex of pure spell energy, you see as things go into it, they begin to disintegrate and disappear."
Lou: Great.
"Kingston: Hey, nobody touch the hurricane! You will disintegrate! Great."
Lou: Can I check in with Alejandro real quick?
"Brennan: Alejandro looks ready, he nods to you, and says to you,"
"Alejandro: We are inside the spell, at the center of the phylactery right now. I can make us a door to the outside, and get our friends here."
Kingston: Okay. Get on that.
"Lou: And then I think I'm gonna cast a, I will cast a fourth, hmm. I will cast…"
[suspenseful music]
"Lou: I will cast a fourth level Bless on Ricky, Sofie, Alejandro, and Pete."
"Brennan: Ricky, Sofie, Alejandro, and Pete, gotcha."
"Ally: That's it, four, right?"
Lou: Yes.
"Brennan: That's Kingston, that is your action is to cast that, any movement or anything else?"
"Lou: At this time, no. I'm not, Kingston, I'm not an athlete."
"Brennan: Yeah, I hear that."
Lou: Do I think this 55 year old man's gonna go from one building to another in the middle of a hurricane? Y'all are crazy!
Brennan: Hell yeah. Buh-buh-bum. That's going to be Alejandro.
Lou: I'm so scared.
"Ally: Yeah. I'm like, how does this even work?"
Zac: Can we fight a tornado?
Lou: [laughs] Exactly. Do we fight the whirlwind?
"Murph: We're not just like, these things are gonna beat the fuck out of us if we try to get this dude."
Lou: Do we start shooting the American Dream? [laughs]
"Brennan: That's you. Alejandro… Buh-buh-bum. [suspenseful music] Would you place this, Alejandro takes, actually steps in front of Kingston and where Alejandro was standing, he creates a rippling gate of fire. [flaming explosions] You see that Alejandro calls out to all of you, saying,"
"Alejandro: It is going to take all of my concentration to keep this open! Any of you, call out the names of those you wish to join us, and I can reach through and grab them!"
"Brennan: Any of you may, as a bonus action on your turn, call out the name of an ally that you have joined in combat before during your time as Champions of New York."
Emily: So they have to be alive?
"Brennan: They have to be alive, sadly."
Emily: Would've been dope to see Dale in action.
[Brennan laughs]
Brennan: Let's see here.
Siobhan: [whispering] Oh God.
[roaring fire]
"Murph: Do they got, do they look like air elemental kind of things, or are they..."
Brennan: They do not.
Murph: Actual tornadoes...
"Brennan: They look like, they do not look like enemies, they just look like spells."
Emily: They are spells personified.
[sound of whooshing]
"Zac: There's like, I mean there's no value attacking them, maybe?"
Ally: Does someone have a Dispel Magic or something?
"Brennan: They begin to move towards you. Kugrash, it's gonna be you."
"Murph: Sweet. I'm going to use a, I don't think anybody who, I don't think I'm gonna call anybody yet, 'cause last time Wally just almost died. He's not really a fighter. I'm gonna go ahead and use a bonus action, I'm gonna summon the unicorn totem this time."
"Brennan: Cool, dope."
"Murph: So I summon the unicorn to come help us, in a way that's calling upon an ally. And then Kugrash is gonna cast Dispel Magic on this guy who's close to us."
"Brennan: Rad, go ahead and roll your, roll your check for Dispel Magic."
Murph: Okay. Come on now.
"Zac: What do you need, do..."
"Murph: I think it's whatever this, DC is 10 plus the spell level."
Brennan: This is gonna be a DC 15.
Murph: Okay. And I have a plus 5.
Brennan: 10 or higher.
[hand slams]
Siobhan: [whispers] Fuck.
Murph: Of course.
Ally: I can...
Siobhan: It was an 8.
"Ally: Can we add or subtract, I can do Bend Luck, I'll spend two sorcery points."
Brennan: What did you roll?
Siobhan: An 8.
Murph: An 8.
"Brennan: It was an 8, cool."
Ally: 3.
Brennan: 3!
Emily: Woo!
"Brennan: Whoom, Kugrash, you reach your hand out, whoom, all your little rat shaman magic, [magical explosion] you snatch the fire away. [whooshing]"
Ally: Great.
Emily: Yeah!
Brennan: Go ahead and place the unicorn totem where you'd like it to go.
Siobhan: What does the unicorn totem do?
"Murph: The unicorn totem, so any time, we have advantage on ability checks to detect creatures and healing spells that I do restore people equal to my druid level. If you're in the aura."
"Emily: Okay, if you're in the aura."
"Murph: So if I heal Ricky, it'll heal you guys."
Emily: Okay.
"Ally: Oh, that's cool."
Emily: Oh great.
Murph: So I'm gonna put this unicorn kind of in the middle.
Ally: Did you say as an action we can call someone?
Brennan: As a bonus action. You can also do it as an action as well if you'd rather do a bonus action instead.
"Ally: Yeah, cool."
Emily: The unicorn totem has advantage on...
"Murph: Like, Perception checks to find things, if anybody's hiding. But it's more for the healing thing. And then I would like, are the rats gonna act on my turn?"
Brennan: The rats are gonna act on your turn as well.
"Murph: Sweet, I would like, [laughs] with everybody's permission, I would like the rats to hitch a ride with some people."
"Ally: Sure, yeah. They can get on my back."
"Emily: Yeah, cover me in rats!"
"Murph: Cool. I'm gonna distribute the rats to people who might have an easier time getting over there, I'm out of Wild Shapes."
[royal rat music]
"Rats: [high-pitched] Finally, the great day of alliance between the rats and the giant folk! Let us into your pockets as we have let you into our hearts!"
[Emily laughs]
"Ricky: Come to me, rats!"
"Sofia: Get into my bag, I have so many snacks in there."
"Ally: My Athletics is actually one, so maybe not me."
"Siobhan: I'm just being like Amy Adams in Enchanted, like Disney Princessing with these rats."
Murph: Sweet. I figure you have Misty Step and stuff...
Siobhan: I do.
Brennan: Cool
"Murph: One over to Misty, one over to Ricky. I can take one, and we'll send one to..."
"Emily: Send one to me, I can take the rats and one of you."
"Murph: Yeah. And then I guess whoever they attack, the rats'll launch out of their thing and..."
Ally: Cool.
Murph: Do a little bite.
"Ally: Oh, so they'll ready an attack?"
"Murph: Yeah, they're gonna, they're ready. [laughs]"
Brennan: Any movement or no?
"Murph: [whispers] Buh-buh-buh. No, I think I'm gonna hang tight."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: You should hit this.
"Brennan: Awesome, Pete, that's you."
Ally: Okay. What does 150 feet look like?
Brennan: Very long. This is like 80 feet here. [holding a transparent plastic ruler]
Ally: Can I reach?
"Brennan: Let's see if you can. So from Pete, where's Pete at? Pete's there? Yeah, so you're there. Yeah, you can for sure."
Ally: Okay. I am going to cast Vitriolic Sphere on whatever that guy is.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: It's a Dex saving throw, and if you fail, it's 10d4 acid damage, and another 5d4 at the end of your next turn."
Brennan: Copy that. So that's gonna be…
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: Buh-buh-bum. Cool. Makes its save, so go ahead and do that 10d4."
"Ally: Oh cool. Can I have some d4s, please?"
Lou: See how my son does today.
[Emily laughs]
Zac: You need more?
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: Do you need more?
Ally: Thank you.
Zac: Take care of my children.
Emily: Do you need my kids in there?
[Murph laughs]
Ally: I need one.
Emily: Okay.
"Ally: One kid, please. Group effort. Okay, 5, 6, 7,10, 12, 13, 14, 17..."
"Emily: It's a save, but my kid's kind of overachieving."
Ally: 22.
"Lou: Okay, well you know… my kid’s had a rough year."
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: 22 points of damage, and then I'm going to use two sorcery points to use Quicken Spell, which allows me to move, use an action as a bonus action."
Brennan: Whoa.
Ally: So I'm also gonna cast Fireball.
Brennan: Whoa!
Emily: Ooh!
Brennan: What's the range on Fireball?
"Ally: Fireball is also 150, this is another dex saving throw, and if, and I'm gonna cast it as a fourth level, so if you fail, I do 9d6 damage."
"Brennan: And this is a dex saving throw, correct?"
Ally: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: Cool. He succeeds. But go ahead and roll damage.
"Ally: Cool, can I have some d6s please?"
Emily: Let's get my kid in there.
"Ally: Thanks. Oh, that's..."
Emily: Get that one out the way.
[Emily laughs]
"Lou: Now this kid, I like this kid a lot."
Zac: Do you need more?
"Ally: Yeah, one more. Thank you. Okay."
Lou: You see what he did? He’s a six.
Emily: He’s a six? [gasps]
"Ally: Two sixes, 5…."
Lou: [blows a kiss to his die] Daddy loves you.
"Ally: 10, 22, 25, so half of 25."
"Brennan: Half of 25, gotcha. Damn. Boom! [magical burst] You see the Dream flying above you, [explosions] takes both of those hits. Looks down at you and goes,"
American Dream: What are you?
Pete: I'm the Vox Fanta! [holds out his knuckle tattoos]
Brennan: It appears to recognize that.
"Ally: Can I roll, really quick, can I do an Arcana check to see what all this mirroring is about, if we can move to the other side?"
"Brennan: Sure, absolutely."
"Ally: Great, yeah, that's 23."
"Brennan: 23, yeah. Reality's collapsing on itself here, this is just very unstable. You don't think you guys are in danger of having this shit happen to you, but this spell's only gonna go on for another minute before it resolves one way or the other."
"Ally: Okay, cool. I'm gonna hop up."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: A little bit.
"Brennan: Dope, go ahead and give me an Athletics check."
Ally: You mean to clear forward? Or to...
Brennan: Are you hopping up on the tilted part?
"Ally: Yeah, just on the tilted part."
"Brennan: Actually that's just difficult terrain, so go ahead and move however you want to move."
"Ally: Cool, I'll just move to wherever he can sit."
"Brennan: And also if you want some little tacky so that he can be on the diagonal, here's some stuff to stick to the bottom of Pete's figurine."
"Ally: I won't go that far, I'll go midway up."
Siobhan: Like here on this window?
Ally: Sure.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Thank you.
"Brennan: Dope. Fighting in this weird, twisted dreamscape is very much your cup of tea, you're right at home. I'm going to need everybody to make a Dexterity, and I'm actually gonna need everybody here to make two Dexterity saving throws."
Ally: Is it for possession or enchantment?
"Brennan: Sorry, Pete actually only needs to make one Dexterity saving throw."
Siobhan: Does this count as a performance?
Brennan: No it does not.
Emily: Is this a spell?
Brennan: It is not a spell.
"Zac: You can add 4 to it, right? 'Cause it's my..."
Brennan: The Bless.
Emily: And then...
"Zac: Because of my Charisma, my Aura of Protection."
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, Aura of Protection, okay, great."
"Murph: With Ricky, I get 24 on the first one."
"Lou: With Ricky, I don't, I definitely fail."
Siobhan: I get 16 on the first one.
"Zac: Oh, plus 4..."
"Lou: 3, 7."
"Brennan: Remember your rolls, I'm gonna go around the table in a second."
Lou: Great.
Brennan: Bada-boom.
"Brennan picks up and moves the entire party, who is whirling around the American Dream on a piece of building."
Emily: Oh...
Lou: That's what you meant when you said it was moving.
Brennan: And this is going to then tilt. Woop! Everyone falling down.
Lou: Wow!
"Brennan: I'm gonna wait one second real quick. Great, thank you. So we're gonna, this moves over here. I'm going to need a, so did anyone get a 17 or below on the first save?"
Zac: My first save was a 17.
"Brennan: 17, so 17 exactly, gotcha."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I got a 16."
Ally: 16.
"Brennan: 16, 16."
Lou: 7.
Emily: I got a 32.
Zac: And I got a 20...
Siobhan: I got a 23 on the second.
"Brennan: Not, don't tell me the second one right now. So the people that failed that were Misty, Ricky, Kingston, and Pete. You guys, this thing is just whipping through the air, you guys are all flung, except for those who made their first save..."
Siobhan: Into the ether?
"Brennan: No, no, no. Tilted, for the first thing that happens is you're knocked prone, so that first save is about being knocked prone. So everyone failed that. And then this is actually gonna move, buh-buh-buh. Da-da-dum."
Brennan rotates the other pieces of terrain on the map. Everything stands up and rotates easily.
"Lou: Goddamn. Goddamn, Rick."
Siobhan: This is amazing.
Lou: What is all of this? What is all of this?
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: Everything be spinning!
"Brennan: Okay. That all spins. Cool. So everyone that, that's one, two, three, four, you guys are all knocked prone. Did anyone get a 17 or below on the second save?"
"Emily: Oh, come on. No."
Murph: 24 again.
"Brennan: Cool. Pete's fine. Or yeah, you're knocked prone. And you actually are knocked prone over in this square here. Kingston, you failed both, right? Bada-boom. So Kingston, you actually are going to take… How much did you fail by, what'd you roll?"
Lou: Second one was 10.
"Brennan: Second one was 10? You take 9 points of falling damage as you are thrown aside. Nobody else failed that second one, right? So prone, prone, Ricky is prone. Sofia, you are standing. Kug, you're standing as well."
"Murph: Cool, I think the unicorn probably stays, right? 'Cause it's an aura, so probably..."
"Brennan: I'm actually okay allowing it to travel on the, if you play, 'cause you're all traveling with it, right? We'll roll for Alejandro."
Lou: He's Blessed.
"Brennan: He is Blessed, that is right. Alejandro actually just jumps down over here, keeping his concentration on the portal, he's okay. Go ahead and roll just one time for your rats, man."
"Murph: Cool. So I rolled a raw 16, plus zero to dex, so 16."
"Brennan: Cool. Whoom, the wind whips around, the whole building, shoom, shunts. You are all flipped over onto the other side. Pete, even though as you're running up, you dip, fall down. Four of you guys are prone, Kingston, you took the hardest fall, smashed into that window there. Alejandro, Kugrash, Sofia, you guys are still on your feet. You see that the Dream up on top of you goes,"
American Dream: [gasps] You are trying to destroy me. That doesn't make sense. I can't let myself be destroyed.
"Brennan: Boom! Surrounded by golden light, reaches a hand out to you, and is going to attack you."
Ally: Shield.
"Brennan: Okay. Bypasses the Shield, still hits. And you take… [whispers] Two, three. Four."
"Ally: This isn't Magic Missile, is it?"
Brennan: Nope.
Ally: Worth a shot.
Siobhan: Do you have specific immunity to Magic Missile?
Ally nods.
"Emily: So specific! [laughs] That's so funny, they show you every fight being like..."
Siobhan: So many dice just got thrown.
Zac: Volley of Arrows. Would you say that...
"Brennan: You take 46 points of damage, as he, boom!"
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: As, [whooshing] this light comes down and destroys you. [magical blast] That's going to be Rowan."
Siobhan: Okay. I'm gonna Misty Step over to the central platform.
Brennan: Okay. You're still prone unless you use movement to get up.
"Zac: With unicorn, we don't have advantage on saving throws?"
Murph: No.
"Zac: Okay, cool."
"Siobhan: And then… What I'm gonna do is, I'm going to Message the American Dream. [laughs]"
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: This is very insane.
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: And using my Actor feat, where I can do an impression of anybody that I have met, or heard speak..."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: I'm going to use the voice of the American Dream inside his own head, and say, This is how you came here, but you don't have to be this. I can be anything, because I'm the American Dream. I don't, I can choose a different path."
"Brennan: Go ahead and, this is not an act of Deception. Go ahead and, with your Actor feat, roll a Persuasion check."
Siobhan: Persuasion?
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
[suspenseful music]
Siobhan: That is a 28.
"Brennan: Cool, and you, I believe you are being the American Dream right now, right?"
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: So you actually do roll with advantage, because of your Actor feat."
Siobhan: Great. I got a 28.
"Brennan: 28! [laughs] You see that this appears to, this affects this being here. It is, you're, the spell you are in is pure evil. This thing is inhuman. And it's very clear that this whole matrix is attempting to close in on this, right? So you see it looks at you, you, give me an Insight check."
Siobhan: 23.
"Brennan: 23, it looks at you with a cool regard, and all its strange, celestial face gives you is the knowledge that you have been heard. And..."
Ally: Do you want to bring anyone through the portal?
Siobhan: I already used my bonus action. Misty Step is a bonus action.
Brennan: And then Message as an action?
Siobhan: And then Message as an action.
Brennan: Gotcha. Cool. That's gonna be Sofia.
Siobhan: Obeying the rules of the game.
Emily: Okay. According to my math...
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Emily: I think I can leap to him. I want to leap up and backpack around him. I want to cling to him like a backpack.
"Siobhan: I'm gonna climb the American Dream? Fuckin' bootstraps, cling to that guy's bootstraps!"
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: With Step of the Wind, just to point it out, my jump is three times from my Louboutins, it's also another three times from Otherworldly Leap, and then Step of the Wind doubles my jump."
"Siobhan: Does that mean you're nine times, 'cause it's three times three?"
"Emily: It means I'm three times three and then another times two, it means I'm 18."
"Brennan: Going by this, but with this calculator your high jump is 72 feet off the ground."
"Emily: Why is it only 72? My thing is 13 and if you do it by three, that would be 39, times three."
Brennan: I'm going off of a very fancy jump calculator for 5e.
"Emily: Do you have a stat wrong for me, maybe?"
"Brennan: 13 strength, five foot seven inches tall, monk Step of the Wind is active, the spell Jump is active, and the magic item Boots of Striding and Springing is active. Your high jump is 72 feet off the ground, let's just, you might be able to reach..."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: But let's just see if you can. I think it also partially depends where you're jumping from, so..."
Zac: Could you just run up the little higher?
"Brennan: Yeah actually, where the position is you could theoretically, if you have enough movement, you could take a circuitous route, let's see."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: So, here's this. 72."
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: Yeah. So, the only place you could reach him from would be from right here."
"Emily: Okay. I think I can get there, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool. Let's count out your movement. That's gonna be, it's five..."
Murph: Some rats are coming with her too.
Brennan: Some rats are coming with her too. So it's gonna be...
"Emily: Yeah, I'll backpack, and then the rats can climb into him."
"Brennan: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30."
Emily: My speed is 45.
"Brennan: Yeah, 30. Jump easy. 45, or sorry. 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60. And you're taking Step of the Wind."
Emily: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: So 60, so then it's another so you can, in other words, begin jumping up to clobber him."
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: Or you can make it all the way up to him if you use your action for a move action.
"Emily: Oh yeah, I'll do that."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: Yeah, I wanna burn my action anyways. All I need is my reaction."
"Brennan: I will say, 'cause here's the thing. If you want, this is weird how D&D works stuff, if you want to be in mid-jump here and save your action, you could potentially..."
Emily: I would like to be within five feet of him.
"Brennan: Dope, I can dig it. I was gonna say, if you wanted to use your action to call someone through the portal, you could also do that, 'cause you'll have that action..."
Ally: But then you'll be in the air and you don't have to fuck with all these saving throws.
"Emily: I want to be within five feet of him so that if he attack, if he casts a spell, I get a reaction attack on him."
"Brennan: Cool, dope. You rush up with a bunch of rats. Let's get Sofie Lee..."
"Emily: But I could be in the air, I don't need to backpack him just yet. Maybe I won't backpack him, because that would..."
"Brennan: Yeah, you can't. So you can get there with your movement..."
Emily: But I want to be within five feet.
Brennan: And then stop.
Siobhan: Amazing. The battle of the car antennas!
"Brennan: What is it Gorgug said in Fantasy High, fight me in the sky?"
Zac: Fight me in the sky.
Ally: Oh yeah!
Brennan: Aah! Cool.
Ally: The fight you were obsessed with being able to fly and no one would join you?
Brennan: Great.
Ally: Fight me in the sky!
"Brennan: And then we've also got some, I'll make a note that we've got some rats joining you there. Awesome, that's Sofia's turn."
Lou: Jesus.
"Zac: Anyone calling anyone, no?"
"Ally: Do you have any actions to call, or..."
"Emily: No, I used my action to get up there."
Brennan: Buh-buh-bum.
[suspenseful music]
Brennan: This thing has a speed of… Cool.
"Lou: Oh, the platforms are coming out!"
Murph: If anybody has any way to buff up for rolls.
"Brennan: You know what, that's a little wobbly. I'm gonna leave that there, but this [one of the trash tornadoes] is on its way up."
Murph: Shit.
Emily: Okay.
[wind whistling]
"Brennan: And then this one is gonna go, is gonna go straight for Rowan. [wind whistling] I'm gonna need,"
Murph: Sorry rats.
Zac: My rats!
Brennan: Your rats! I'm gonna need Rowan and the rats to make...
Emily: Rowan and the rats! That's your band.
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: To make a Strength saving throw.
Ally gets out their phone and takes a picture of the map.
Siobhan: Oh boy. All right.
"Murph: Oh, okay. Oh, wait no, I was looking at a reef shark."
"Emily: Ally, put your fucking phone away! [laughs]"
"Ally: It's so gorgeous, Rowan's character is already leaning like this, and the..."
Siobhan: 17.
Murph: 15.
"Siobhan: 17 and 15, cool. Rowan, the rats are flung here to the edge, they can't go prone. Rowan, you are flung here to the edge of the platform. And you also take, buh-buh-buh. 20 points of bludgeoning damage."
Siobhan: Fuck.
Brennan: As the wind hits you.
"Siobhan: I'm already low from our previous fight, so I'm at 34 right now."
Brennan: Whoom!
Lou: How much did you take?
Siobhan: 20 damage.
Brennan: That's going to be… Another spin.
Zac: God.
Siobhan: My hit point max is only 54.
Zac: I haven't even gone. [laughs]
Murph: Fuckin' lair actions.
Siobhan: [whispers] Fuck!
[humming]
[magical blasting]
Murph: Is that area in the middle more stable?
Brennan: Hm?
Murph: Is that area...
"Brennan: Yes, these ones look more stable than this one you guys are on."
Murph: 'Cause we're getting knocked around.
Brennan: You guys are getting knocked around over here pretty hard. This one swivels back over here. I'm gonna once again need two saving throws from everybody who's on this platform over here.
Lou: Goddammit. Oh my God. Dexterity?
Murph: With Ricky...
Brennan: Let me know the first one.
Murph: 17.
Ally: What do we add to it? Dex?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: What'd you get, 17?"
Murph: 17.
"Brennan: Cool, Kug, you're knocked prone."
Murph: Fuck!
Ally: 16.
Zac: 23 for me.
"Brennan: 16 for Pete, Pete, you are flung all the way to the very edge right over here. What do..."
Lou: 12 and 16.
"Brennan: 12 and 16, cool."
Lou: I hate this.
"Brennan: You are knocked to the edge, Kingston. Ricky, what did you get."
Zac: I got a 23 as my first roll.
"Brennan: You're still prone, but you take no further damage. Which was your second one?"
Zac: 19.
"Brennan: 19, cool, you're okay. How are these rats faring over here? Roll another save for your rats that are still on the platform."
"Murph: Oh, 19."
"Brennan: Rats are okay. Kingston, you're gonna take another 6 points of bludgeoning damage. [thudding] And you're just being rocked around in the tornado. Alejandro… Miraculously lands on his feet, spry old guy, fwoom."
"Kingston: Making me look bad, Alejandro."
"Alejandro: See, this is why I say you need to have some joie de vivre..."
"Kingston: Gifs, stop, I, gifs are not the difference between, that..."
Alejandro: Can I ask you a question?
Kingston: Yes.
Alejandro: Did you talk to Liz?
"Kingston: [stammers] I… The man, the fight is on!"
"Alejandro: Because I see a little, I see a little spring..."
Kingston: You need to focus on bringing people through this portal. You have brought...
Alejandro: I am holding the portal open! You guys are not focusing on driving the people through the portal! The portal has been made!
"Brennan: You see that, cool."
"Ally: Do I have to make a second save, or that was just..."
Brennan: You… You do not have to make a second save. I'm also gonna need actually Misty to make a Dexterity saving throw here as well.
"Siobhan: Okay. Plus dex, 22."
Brennan: You are not knocked one square outside.
"Siobhan: [alarmed] Oy! [whooshing] All right, get to the middle it is!"
Emily: Oy!
"Brennan: That's going to be, buh-buh-buh, Pete, you cast two spells, right?"
Ally: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: I'm gonna need two Wild Magic rolls.
Ally: Oh right. Nat 1.
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
Brennan: Wild. Give me the other one just to see.
Ally: 2.
[Siobhan laughs]
Brennan: Wild.
Zac: Is that two?
Siobhan: So you get two Wild...
"Ally: No, that's one."
Zac: 'Cause it resets.
Ally: ‘Cause it resets.
"Emily: Oh, right."
[Emily laughs]
Murph: Yikes!
Ally: Really not rolling well today!
Lou: I already have chills.
"Siobhan: I mean, unless…"
Lou: This is unreal. This is so dumb.
"Ally: While I'm doing this, can I roll an Insight to see why I'm not getting any bludgeoning damage from this dream world? Or an Arcana?"
"Brennan: Oh! No 'cause, did, you made your second saving throw, didn't you? What was your second saving throw?"
"Ally: Oh, the first time I didn't have to."
"Brennan: Oh, the first time you didn't, 'cause you moved, 'cause it, you moved to the side where you weren't falling. These guys are on the upside and getting flung over to the other side as it tilts wildly."
Ally: Got it.
"Brennan: You feel the Wild Magic, [whooshing] force of dreams entering your body. You feel that you have the ability to either, the Wild Magic is, you're like, oh, it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen! It can either go to your eyes or your skin. Something that can either help you maybe perceive some stuff or something that can make you stronger..."
"Ally: Stronger, absolutely fucking stronger."
"Brennan: [claps] Jesus Christ, Pete. You gain resistance to all damage for the next minute."
Murph: Nice.
"Brennan: Your skin goes, boom, just chrome, all your skin is fucking chrome, you're like a mirror..."
[Ally yells]
Ally: [laughs] Cool.
[magical burst]
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Minute in combat is how many turns?
Brennan: 10 rounds.
"Ally: That's amazing. Yeah, okay, let's start counting rounds."
Zac: The last fight was five rounds?
"Brennan: Five rounds, yeah."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: Back to the top of the initiative order, Kingston, that's gonna be you."
"Zac: Oh, I haven't gone yet."
"Brennan: Oh Ricky, I'm sorry. Ricky, that's right, you're last, Ricky. You go on a two. Ricky, that's you."
"Zac: There's no way I could have said that I cast Divine Sense before this, right?"
"Brennan: Sure, you can cast Divine Sense before this."
Zac: Okay. Just wanted to be able to see if I know...
Brennan: That thing is a celestial.
Zac: Okay. Cool.
Emily: Interesting.
Zac: And okay.
Brennan: Doesn't necessarily mean that it's good.
Emily: Right.
Brennan: But it's a celestial.
Zac: Okay.
Emily: But it means that necrotic damage would hurt it. I would assume. Maybe.
"Zac: I, [sighs] so it feels like Turn the Unholy won't work 'cause it only works on fiends or undead. Then I will cast Sacred Weapon. [sound of shimmering] And say Esther. Es— [laughs] Why can't I say that word? Esther."
"Brennan: [rumbling] So you're over here, you say Esther. Esther, her makeup streaming down her face, tear-streaked face, smiling wide, whipping this silver bat around. Bursts through the portal, lands on top of you, and gets one hand on your ass and fuckin' plants her mouth on your mouth."
Siobhan: Yes!
"Esther: I'm so fucking into you, you this fuckin' dumb, hot piece, you're so good, you're so heroic, I fuckin' love you!"
Ricky: You're great! I think you’re great!
"Esther: You don't even read books, who gives a shit? I read books all the time, I'm miserable!"
Ricky: You grabbed my ass pretty hard.
Esther: I want to fuck you!
Brennan: You see...
"Ricky: I didn't want to call you here, 'cause it's really dangerous, but I don't know what else to do."
Esther: Let's live a dangerous life together.
Ricky: Okay.
"Brennan: You see that she hoists you to your feet, and you cast Sacred Weapon, right?"
"Zac: Yes, and then I wanted to take my movement to run up to the top of that."
"Brennan: Oh, up to this thing here?"
Zac: Just to get on this platform.
"Brennan: Dope. Let's see, I'm gonna see what your jump is right now. Your Strength..."
"Zac: I have, yeah, I don't actually have my speed..."
"Siobhan: And he has Freedom of Movement, so he doesn't have to worry about difficult terrain."
"Brennan: Awesome. We still need to see what his high jump is. So since we're not gonna worry about difficult terrain, you can reach up and grab something 16.6 feet off the ground."
Zac: Could I also just...
"Brennan: And difficult terrain doesn't, so yeah, Freedom of Movement means this is not, oh yeah! Fuck yeah!"
"Zac: I can get up there, right?"
"Brennan: You can just get the fuck up there, cool. So you're going..."
Zac: And I got my rats with me.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty five, thirty."
Siobhan: Get into the middle of the platform if you can.
"Brennan: Well, you've used your action."
"Siobhan: Oh, yeah, you’re right."
"Brennan: And your bonus, right?"
"Zac: Yes. And yeah, I guess there's nothing else I can really do."
"Brennan: Mm-hmm. Rad. But Esther appears. Cool, Kingston, that's gonna be you."
"Zac: Oh, can I tell her,"
Ricky: You can yell names too!
"Brennan: She goes,"
Esther: Got it!
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: Wow, the first thing now that you guys have had your first kiss, the first thing you do..."
Zac: I'm overwhelmed!
"Brennan: That's going to be, yeah, that's Kingston."
"Lou: Great. Okay, I guess I get up and walk away from the edge."
"Brennan: So that's fifteen. Five, ten, so you can get to here."
"Lou: Great, perfect. And then I yell, I'm now, I wanted to call in Wally so badly."
"Kingston: Willy, get your brick butt in here!"
"Murph: Ah, Willy's good!"
[Brennan growls]
"Brennan: You see Willy, gwoom! Emerges from the portal."
Willy: Kingston Brown!
Brennan: You see that vampire blood is just dripping off of his giant brick fists.
Willy: Good to see you. You caught me at a great time.
"Kingston: Oh, well, you caught me at a bad time, I'm falling all over the place. This place is wild."
"Willy: What, there's some kind of schmuck make a spell or something?"
"Kingston: Yeah, that's the American Dream. That's the real, that's the..."
Willy: [dismissively] Ehh.
"Kingston: Yeah, that's what I thought. He's not that great. Anyway. Let's get to work."
Lou: And then can I cast Dispel Magic on this tornado?
"Brennan: Yes you can, go ahead and give me a roll."
Lou: Great.
Murph: Come on!
"Lou: I don't think, what is it, it's plus my spell, attack or spell casting?"
"Brennan: Plus your, just Wisdom modifier."
"Lou: Oh, okay. Then yeah, 8."
[wind whistling]
"Brennan: Cool. That's now, so that's Kingston. Esther is going to go. And one up in front of Willy over here. [sound of footsteps] [grunts] [whooshing] Kind of following Ricky up that hillside. And Esther reaches out and hits you with a Haste spell."
Zac: Tight.
[magical blast]
"Brennan: That's, and I'll go ahead and give you that. And Esther's actually gonna use her bonus action. She's not gonna call a name. She's instead going to ready a spell for next turn with a bonus action. But I'll go ahead and give you Haste. Boom. That's going to be Alejandro, who's keeping the portal open. But is also gonna go ahead and hit, Kingston's getting knocked around. He's gonna go ahead and hit Kingston with a Protection from Good and Evil."
Lou: Okay.
[sound of sparkling]
"Brennan: So you have that spell, so that he's casting that on you."
Lou: Great.
Brennan: That's going to be these guys here.
[suspenseful music]
Brennan: That's gonna be…
[whooshing]
Lou: Wow.
"Brennan: This thing lands on top of Pete. Pete, I'm gonna need you to make a Dexterity saving throw."
Ally: Sure.
Murph: [whispering] Fuck.
Ally: 9.
"Brennan: Are you close enough to Ricky? Oh, Ricky's gone."
"Zac: Yeah, I fuckin'..."
Ally: It's gonna really suck to not take any damage!
"Emily: Woo! I think you take half, right? Is that what resistance..."
Murph: Resistance is half.
Ally: With my thing that I got?
"Siobhan: [quietly, to Murph] Can I read your unicorn thing? Do you have the unicorn? Can I read it?"
"Brennan: Your thing, resistance is half. So all damage is half."
"Murph: Oh, I don't have it out. But I have it here. [showing Siobhan his sheet]"
[Emily laughs]
"Ally: Oops. It's interesting, I did hear that wrong. Ahh, hmm."
[Emily laughs]
Siobhan: [reading Murph’s unicorn totem description] To detect creatures.
"Brennan: 9, 18..."
Ally: Interesting.
"Murph: [quietly] I might need to cast a spell and end the aura, though."
"Brennan: 25\. You take 15 points of damage, which would have been 31."
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: Whoom,"
Ally: Interesting.
Brennan: As this pillar of flame lands on top of you.
[whooshing]
Ally: Hmm. I'll take that into consideration.
Brennan: That's gonna be Kugrash.
Murph: Oy. Okay.
"Brennan: Oh sorry. Also, as soon as Willy appears, he hits the ground with his feet. Boom! [sound of explosion] Everybody prone stands."
"Murph: Oh, great."
"Emily: Oh, that's so fun!"
"Murph: Oh, thanks Willy."
Emily: It must be so fun to get jolted upright.
Siobhan: It's like when you're lying on a trampoline and somebody jumps on it.
"Brennan: You see he looks, he goes like,"
"Willy: What for you all lay around, we in the middle of a fight, try to keep your eye on the ball!"
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: That's going to be Kug.
"Murph: Cool. Dispel Magic has a range of 120 feet, I think I might try to help Misty out here, 'cause I think that there's enough people to help with that one. Cool. Can I try to dispel this guy?"
"Brennan: Which guy? Oh, this one over here? Yes you can."
"Murph: The one that's after Misty. Come on! Come on, please!"
Siobhan: Yes!
"Murph: [arms up in the air] Yes, 17, a 22."
[whooshing]
Brennan: And disappears.
Emily: That's good.
Lou: That's real good.
Emily: That's good.
"Murph: And then as a bonus action, I guess I'll call the gnome that has the clock on, what was his name again?"
Siobhan: Bilbry?
"Brennan: Bilbry? I'm gonna say, just for the purpose of this battle..."
Murph: Okay.
"Brennan: That unless you've fought with people, unless you have been in a fight with people before, you cannot call them to this battle."
"Siobhan: So like Em, Sondheim."
Murph: I'll call Em.
"Brennan: Cool. You call out for Em, and, buh-buh-buh-bum, buh-buh, bum."
Ally: Who else have we fought with?
Lou: Stephen Sondheim.
Siobhan: That's all I can remember.
Lou: Pizza Rat.
"Siobhan: Pizza Rat? Ooh yeah, Pizza Rat would be great, Nod."
Brennan: Em comes soaring. [whooshing]
[heavenly music]
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: Wings out, Em."
"Emily: That's good, she's a flyer, that's so smart!"
Siobhan: And she can heal.
"Brennan: As soon as Em appears, As soon as Em appears, anyone who is injured. [rolls a die, it drops off the table] Oop! I pulled an Ally, hold on, sorry."
"Ally: Oh, that's not an Ally! That’s not an Ally!"
"Siobhan: Nice, nice. That’s what it's called!"
Lou: It’s all the way behind them.
Brennan: Pulling an Ally is specifically when your d4 does not make it to the table.
"Ally: All right, actually, yeah."
Emily: And then you eat peanuts off of it.
Ally makes a chomping noise.
Brennan: Everybody who's injured regains 7 hit points.
Ally: Yeah!
"Brennan: As soon as Em appears. Em comes out, and she's like,"
"Em: Oh my God, what is this, some kind of fuckin' tacky Fourth of July angel? This is some bullshit."
"Sofia: I know, I'm on it, girl."
"Em: I got your back, girl, you know it! Let him knock you..."
Sofia: Do you see how high I am?
"Em: Oh my God, you don't even have wings!"
"Sofia: Shh, I'm gonna backpack him!"
"Brennan: You guys, that's an,"
Em: I won't tell.
"Brennan: She soars up here, [wind and lightning] That is going to be, at the end of, Kugrash, at the end of your turn. 10 foot radius. That's gonna be a 20 foot diameter. Yeah, that's everybody. Everybody on this platform needs to make a Dexterity saving throw. You, because you are all next to Willy, you all roll with advantage."
Ally: Is this against…
"Emily: Is this a spell, or is this more of the moving?"
Brennan: This is a spell.
Emily: Is he casting it?
Brennan: He is casting it.
Emily: Then I get an attack on him.
Brennan: Woo! Go for it.
Emily: I’m a mage-slayer.
"Siobhan: Wait, hang on, Counterspell."
"Brennan: You are, there's no way you're within 60 feet."
"Siobhan: You're right! Well, look. If you're really gonna play the rules that hard."
Emily: Does a 25 hit him?
Brennan: A 25 does hit him.
[Emily laughs smugly]
"Ally: So if you do damage, would that cancel the spell?"
Emily: 11.
"Brennan: 11 points of damage. He takes 11 points of damage, boom. As..."
"Emily: He also, does he have any spells that have concentration?"
Brennan: Yes.
"Emily: Then he has to, he gets disadvantage on his saving throw to maintain its concentration."
"Brennan: Very cool. 5. He might actually, no, he succeeds. However, I'm gonna need you to make, as you make that, or as you close the final range to make that attack on him, I'm gonna need you to make a Dexterity saving throw."
Emily: Okay.
[dramatic music]
Brennan: This is where Evasion’s gonna come in very handy.
"Emily: Ah, I got a, let's see. A 36. Wait, does that have 36? Maybe 26? No."
Brennan: 26.
"Emily: 26, yeah, I got a 26."
"Brennan: Cool. He has an incredibly powerful spell that is fucking shredding everything around him with these ribbons of light, you dodge them all effortlessly and take no damage!"
[Emily laughs]
Ally: Wow.
"Brennan: That's huge. However, I will need those Dexterity saves from..."
Ally: Am I saving versus enchantment or possession?
"Brennan: No, you are not."
Murph: 22 for Kug.
Brennan: 22.
Lou: I had 19.
"Emily: Since I used Evasion, does that count as him missing me?"
Ally: What is this?
Brennan: 19?
Lou: 19.
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: Does that count as him missing me?
Ally: 12.
Brennan: No. It does not count as him missing you.
Ally: 12.
"Emily: Oh, 'cause that's melee, right."
"Brennan: So 12, 19."
Murph: 22.
Brennan: 22.
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: Anything, and then that's Alejandro, Willy, and Esther. Buh-buh-bum. Okay. So actually, I think everyone fails this one, actually."
Murph: 22 fails?
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Lou: I thought I had done it with a 19, I thought, look at this, I get to pass a Dexterity saving throw."
Emily: Yeah.
Lou: What a fool I was.
"Emily: Kug, was it just your turn?"
Murph: Yes.
Emily: Do the rats go on your turn?
"Murph: They do, but they can't really do anything."
"Emily: Did you want to say they prepare an action, so that when I make contact, they attack?"
"Murph: Yeah, I think if you guys attack anybody, the rats with you will… Join it."
Zac: Prepare that action.
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: So Kingston, Esther, Alejandro, Willy, Kugrash, and sorry, actually not Pete. Pete, you're outside of the blast radius. It's not that large of an explosion, but you see that the angel just literally sends a missile out of his hand. [blasts] Boom, you are all blowed up, each taking 21 points of damage."
Ally: Was it Magic Missile?
"Brennan: No, it was not Magic Missile."
"Ally: Goddammit, one day!"
"Lou: And then do I need to, for concentration?"
Brennan: You need to roll for concentration. As actually does...
Lou: You say 21?
"Brennan: 21, so the DC's still 10."
Murph: Check on my totem thing.
Lou: Plus my Wisdom? Or plus my Con?
Brennan: Plus your Con.
"Lou: Oh yeah, 12."
"Brennan: Cool. That's gonna be, and then, Alejandro loses his protection, he fails his concentration."
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: Esther maintains hers on Haste. That's going to be Pete.
Ally: [yawning] Great. [laughs]
"Siobhan: All right now, any time."
"Lou: Pete, I'm glad you're relaxed right now."
"Murph: You don't have Dispel Magic, do you?"
"Ally: I don't. I am going to… Yeah, I guess I'm just going to run and try to get up on that platform."
"Brennan: Okay. Yeah. Five, ten, fifteen. Twenty, twenty-fire, so you can make it about here. In a single movement."
"Ally: Okay. Man. I, 60 feet is not, that's a 150 guy, right? Yeah, okay. I'm gonna call for Stephen Sondheim."
Siobhan: Great.
Murph: He was kidnapped by two pixies!
Ally: And I'm going to use the...
Zac: Please call someone else!
Ally: Really?
"Siobhan: No, absolutely call Stephen Sondheim!"
Ally: He saved the day the other day!
"Brennan: Stephen Sondheim bursts through the portal and goes,"
Sondheim: Of course. The third act. Here we all are. Peter.
Pete: Ricky loves this! Thank you!
"Sondheim: Course, Peter. You have a gift, as do we all."
"Pete: Oh, well that kind of took it away. I love you like I've loved everyone I've ever dated."
Siobhan: Oh no! That's so sad!F
Ally: Can I use the rest of my movement to try to hop up where Ricky is? Or my action as movement?
"Brennan: Oh, sorry. Can you use your action to, oh, and so that was your bonus action. Yeah, you want to use your action to jump up there?"
"Ally: Please, yeah, I would like to get the fuck off of this."
"Brennan: Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, so 30, you make it right here behind Ricky, kind of getting partial cover behind this thing there. You, huh huh, and this thing is whipping around. So it's that thing where it pulls away from you like, aah!"
[something crashes behind Brennan]
Siobhan: Whoa!
Brennan: We're good!
Siobhan: Now that's pulling an Ally!
"Ally: No, that's not what it's called!"
"Brennan: Guys. When I kicked over all the figurines, that was a total Ally move."
"Ally: Okay! I'm like so athletic. And I'm like, I have balance and poise."
Brennan: Wonderful.
"Ally throws a die from one hand to to other, catching it neatly and showing it off."
Emily: Woo!
"Ally: That's right, bitch! No, I won't do that."
Brennan: That's Pete.
Ally: Thank you.
Lou: That's right.
"Brennan: And immediately after Pete's turn, this whole thing. [humming]"
Brennan begins to spin the group’s platform again.
Murph: We gotta get off this.
"Lou: This is, yeah, we have..."
"Zac: I wish I'd grabbed somebody, I should have fuckin'..."
"Lou: Yeah, I'm truly gonna ask Willy to take me with him. Willy, let's..."
"Brennan: Cool! This thing tilts again, I'm gonna first, let's do the tilt roll first. Everyone roll a Dexterity save, please."
Murph: Yipes.
"Lou: Come on, maybe today. And is it advantage with Willy?"
"Brennan: If you're within five feet of Willy, it's with advantage. All saving throws are advantage within five feet of Willy."
Murph: Sweet.
"Lou: Beautiful. That's gonna be, I still don't think I fuckin' passed, 16?"
Murph: 23.
Lou: 16 doesn't do it. Kugrash passes.
"Emily: Kingston, you gotta get off of it! This platform was not made for you!"
"Brennan: Is, of the people that are on, and then it's all mostly allies, right?"
"Siobhan: Man, you spent so much time on trains, you think you'd be better at standing..."
Emily: Because he never has to deal with any… intervenience.
"Kugrash: You gotta take a wide stance, Kingston!"
"Kugrash: Okay, I know how to stand!"
"Kingston: You ever been on the subway, Kingston?"
Kugrash: I have been on the subway more times than any of y'all can count.
"Emily: Guys, you don’t remember that public trans—"
"Brennan: I think Kingston, actually, you're the only one who falls..."
"Lou: Don't do this to me, why'd you have to call me out like that?"
"Brennan: You see that as you go for a dip, Willy has his readied action, grabs you, and boom! Leaps off the building."
"Willy: Beautiful, man. And this nice coat lying on the ground."
"Kingston: Get off of me, get off of me, I can stand on my own two feet!"
"Willy: Ah, you’re a mensch."
Brennan: As he pinches your cheek.
"Kingston: Oh, stop it! I'm a grown man! [laughs]"
"Murph: Kingston's one of those dudes that, as a point of pride, doesn't hold on to anything on the subway but then, like, falls backwards."
"Lou: Exactly. Yeah, I do a lot of, yeah."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: A lot of...
"Siobhan: I don't want to take up anybody else's space, I'll just stand here."
"Brennan: Cool. Everyone else makes it, but I am gonna need another round of Dex saves from people there."
[Lou sighs]
Murph: This is still Willy helping?
"Murph: Willy's still helping, yep."
"Lou: Woo, okay!"
"Siobhan: Oh, okay."
Murph: 20...
"Lou: In Willy's lovely arms, I finally pass."
Murph: 23.
Siobhan: So romantic.
"Brennan: Cool. Kug, you pass. Alejandro actually takes a little bit of a dip."
Lou: Even with the Bless?
"Brennan: Even with the Bless, Alejandro takes a little bit of a dip."
Murph: How's Sondheim doing?
"Brennan: Sondheim lands spryly to his feet, he's looking great. Sondheim's looking fucking gold."
Ally: That’s right. Watch him save the day.
Lou: I really do love Stephen Sondheim.
"Ally: Also, I couldn't remember anyone else we fought with, I was like, the alligators?"
"Siobhan: Oh, those alligators."
Emily: They would be able to do nothing here! [laughs]
Siobhan: Nothing at all.
"Murph: Yeah, I already summoned my rats."
Siobhan: They're so slow.
Zac: We couldn't call Esther's parents or anything?
Ally: I was thinking Esther could call them.
Brennan: You have not fought with them.
"Siobhan: I have one, I have one. [taps her nose]"
"Brennan: Cool. You got, now for that second save, did anybody fail? Know Kugrash didn't, you passed, great. Alejandro takes a dip. Let's see if he loses concentration. He does not. Boom! Takes a little slide. That is going to be the Dream."
[ominous music]
"Brennan: I am going to need, Protection from Good is gone on Kingston, right? Who's thrown shit, Pete's thrown shit. But you're down here. This thing turns just to look at Sofia leaping towards him. Do you have any protection shit on you or no?"
"Emily: No, in fact, I used my reaction already."
Brennan: Mkay. That's a hit.
"Siobhan: Mmm, mm-mm, hang on."
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: Minus 7.
Brennan: Hold on. [whispering] 15 plus 15 is 30 minus 7… [normal] Still hits.
Siobhan: Fuck!
Emily: Thank you for trying.
Siobhan shrugs a little.
Brennan: Next one.
Zac: Next one?
Emily: Fuck me up. [laughs]
"Ally: It is what it, oh, and then you died."
Emily: Fuck me up.
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: And then you get to be with your beautiful husband who you love very much.
Lou: Okay. [laughs] We don't need to talk in this way.
Ally: It'll be fine when you die.
Lou: Okay.
"Siobhan: I want you to die, actually. I hope you die!"
Ally: Please don't die!
Emily: I definitely...
Ally: This is all a bit.
Emily: I definitely dressed for this as maybe my death.
"Ally: Please, no."
Brennan: From the first attack...
Emily: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: You take…
Brennan rolls a pretty decently-sized handful of dice.
Siobhan: [gasps] Oh no!
"Brennan: 7, 8, 15, 27."
"Lou: It's like, and now..."
"Emily: Hey, I'm at full, but I'm trying to think if I have anything that..."
[suspenseful music]
Brennan: You take 49 damage from the first attack.
Zac: 49?
Ally: Do the rats attack?
Emily: I'm still standing.
Brennan: You're still standing? This second attack was a nat 20.
Siobhan: Oh no.
Emily: Oh I'm for sure dead. Unless the second attack...
Ally: Where do you land if you die? Can one of us...
Brennan: It will remain to be seen what happ— where Sofia lands. This next attack...
"Emily: Good, waste your turn on me."
"Lou: My heart is, it's beating so fast right now. For those at home who can't see my insides."
"Ally: Maybe Em can fly in, catch you?"
Siobhan: Maybe.
Brennan: [whispers] 15. 23.
"Zac: What happens if you use Bend Luck on a nat 20, does that matter?"
"Siobhan: I mean, I already used my..."
Emily: I think I'm...
Siobhan: Bardic? It didn't?
"Emily: Absolutely, I'm down, there's no point in even counting it."
Ally: What does happen if you use Bend Luck on a nat 20?
"Siobhan: It doesn't, I think it's still a nat 20. Right?"
"Lou: Yeah, it has to be."
Ally: Yeah.
Lou: A nat 20's a nat 20.
Ally: But I feel like it would change a nat one.
Emily: I feel like there's something I'm missing. Doesn't it feel like on one of these cards I'm gonna have something that negates all this?
Brennan: You take 89 damage from the second attack.
Siobhan: Oh my God.
"Emily: That's more than my hit point max. Does that mean I'm dead, official?"
"Lou: But, you're not… are you zero?"
"Brennan: Is there, once you get to zero, is there your hit point max left?"
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: Once I get to zero...
Siobhan: It's minus.
"Emily: Yeah, yeah, 'cause 89 is 35 minus 89, yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool, okay. The celestial turns to you, his eyes flare with red, white, and blue light, and a beam of concentrated energy strikes you in the chest. [magical blast] I'm going to need you also, and I know this seems like adding insult to injury, I'm gonna need you to make a Constitution saving throw."
"Emily: [quietly] Okay. Am I still Blessed, though?"
Brennan: You are still Blessed.
Murph: Arguably.
Lou: Even in death.
Ally: [laughs] Arguably.
Emily: 8.
Lou: Fuck!
"Brennan: Sofia, you are dead. Full dead."
"Ally: Wait, like not making saving throws?"
Brennan: No saves necessary.
Murph: You have a Revivify?
"Lou: I do, of course I do."
[magical blast]
"Brennan: Your soul floats through the tornado, and you see a hand reaching out, being restrained at the Pearly Gates, as Dale reaches out to you."
[raspy breath]
Pete: No!
"Kugrash: Sof, don't go! You gotta wait—"
Pete: No!
"Sofia: I mean, I would love to come back and help you finish this fight, but..."
Pete: No buts!
"Lou: You have to tell us about her body, what is her body doing?"
"Brennan: It is rent asunder, her rib cage and lungs burst out of her chest, and she begins to fall through the air."
Emily: Can we say that the rats jump off of me onto him?
"Brennan: Yeah, they have a readied action. For sure."
"Kugrash: Rats, get your revenge!"
"Murph: It's like slow motion, the music is cut. Kugrash is just screaming, and little rats are jumping for him."
Lou: Freeze frame! Now you're wondering how I got this...
"Brennan: There's a bunch of rats on his head. Yeah, Sofia. [whooshing]"
"Murph: Technically, they can move another..."
"Emily: I'm falling backwards, right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Lou: With Slow Fall, does she fall slowly?"
"Emily: I do have Slow Fall, but..."
"Brennan: That's, Sofia hitting, she immediately drops 20 feet. On her next turn, she will plummet into the hurricane."
"Kingston: Em, you gotta do something!"
Brennan: Buh-buh-bah.
Ally: Did we battle anyone else who could fly?
"Siobhan: Yeah, I got it."
Brennan: That's going to be...
"Siobhan: It's me next, right?"
Murph: Can the rats attack?
Brennan: Willy actually jumps you in the initiative order.
Zac: Do the rats attack?
Brennan: The rats actually can attack. You can roll an attack for the rats.
Siobhan: Yes.
"Murph: Just does a, wait, where the fuck are my rats?"
"Emily: Come on, attack little friends!"
"Murph: Ah, there they are. That's a 20 to hit."
Brennan: A 20 to hit? Cool. That hits.
"Murph: Yeah, get 'em rats!"
"Brennan: I'm sorry, a 20? 20 does not hit."
Siobhan: 20 doesn't hit. Jesus christ.
"Brennan: I was listening to him, my apologies."
"Lou: They're on his head, though!"
"Brennan: I know, they're all over his body! He looks upset!"
Siobhan: He looks so grossed out that he gets disadvantage.
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"American Dream: Oh, oh no. Oh no. This city is a filthy trash pile. I'm covered in rats. I hate this place."
Ally: That's a terrible DeNiro impression.
"Brennan: [laughs] Willy does not have a lot of movement, but he's gonna use all of it. Yeah, that'll do it. He hoists you up in one arm, Kingston."
Kingston: I don't like this.
"Willy: Let's get moving, old man."
Kingston: Okay!
[foot stomping]
"Brennan: And, whoom! Leaps the chasm, bam. You land on the center platform here."
"Lou: Oh man, I love Willy."
"Brennan: But that's his whole, he only has 20 movement. Not a fast guy, Willy, shockingly. Rowan, it's gonna be you."
"Siobhan: Okay. I'm gonna get up, and I'm gonna say,"
"Rowan: Santa, we could really use some help right now."
"Santa: Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry New Year's!"
Brennan: You see that...
"Zac: A very good call, I forgot completely about Santa."
"Siobhan: I was like, what have we done, what have we done, what have we done, what have we done? [laughs]"
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: And then I would like to, can I use the Puppet spell on Sofia?"
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
"Siobhan: Great, then I would like to use the Puppet spell to move her over, to get her safely to the ground."
Murph: Ooh! [claps]
Brennan: Hell yeah. You...
Siobhan: To as close to Kingston as is possible.
Ally: Into Kingston’s arms.
"Brennan: A bunch of marionette strings come out of your hand. Whoosh, swat! And you thwack Sofia to the ground. She's already dead, so she ain't getting more hurt."
"Emily: Oh my God, just a dead Sofia just drops in Kingston's lap. [laughs]"
Siobhan: Can I just get up and move?
"Brennan: Yes, go for it."
"Lou: What a turn, what a turn!"
"Brennan: What a turn, Rowan!"
"Santa: Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
"Brennan: Santa bursts through the portal, reaches into his bag."
Santa: I've got gifts for naughty little boys and girls this time! [screams]
Brennan: And takes an eight foot lance of peppermint and hurls it at the American Dream.
Siobhan: Wild!
Lou: What a great Santa.
Ally: Peppermint damage.
Kugrash: There's some rats up there.
"Kingston: Watch the rats, Santa!"
"Brennan: He, you see him, [grunts] wah! This peppermint spear thuds into the body of the American Dream."
Santa: Ahh! It's time for a little war on Earth! Bad will to… [tilts his head] angels? Hard to say.
"Brennan: You see, incredible. Sondheim sprints, One, bah, bah, bah. [grunts] Rushes over here. And is actually gonna take a double move. [footfalls] Jumps up here."
Zac: Take the stage?
Emily: Take the stage with me!
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Sondheim: Friends, geniuses, lovers. We decide the soul of America today. When I was writing Assassins, I pondered long and hard on the nature of violence. By the way, Rowan. We haven't formally met, Stephen Sondheim."
"Rowan: Oh my God, I'm such a big fan. Is it true that you have a kink basement hidden in your building?"
Sondheim: Every rumor you hear is partially true. [ding]
Rowan: Hot.
"Brennan: He winks, you have a d10 Bardic Inspiration."
Lou: Oh!
Zac: Okay!
"Brennan: [laughs] Everyone's nodding like yes, yes, yes."
"Siobhan: Yeah, that reads, that tracks."
"Brennan: I don't know if these spun. Did I spin these already? No, I didn't."
"Siobhan: No, I don't think so."
"Brennan: So that's gonna go here. [whooshing] And this one's actually going to, I'll pick this up very gently. And, whoo, there we go. And put that right there. That's now going to be, Sofia, you are dead. Who looks very badly injured here?"
"Siobhan: I'm okay, I'm at 41."
"Ally: I'm at 25. I'm not bad. I'm taking half damage, too, so it's not that..."
"Brennan: Em's right next to you, so Em is going to drop down onto the platform, and hit you for, Jesus, rolled two 8. 21 points of healing."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Em: Oh sweetheart, you got banged up."
[blast]
Pete: Thanks a lot.
"Em: Hey. You're all right, kid."
"Brennan: That's going to be, the wind. It's gonna move across here. I'm gonna need Pete and Ricky and the rats to all roll Dex saves."
"Zac: Okay, I have advantage on dex saves, and you have, you can add plus 4 to it."
Ally: Cool.
"Siobhan: I have plus 4 as well, because you're in the Aura of Protection."
Murph: 17 for the rats.
"Ally: 13\. Oh, and my dex, sorry, 16."
"Zac: Oh, you're Blessed too, right?"
Ally: I rolled it.
"Zac: Okay, so. 18 for me."
"Brennan: 18 for you, you got a 16."
"Zac: Pretty shitty roll, Considering all of it."
Ally: Yes. Yeah same. [laughs]
"Brennan: Pete, you take 15 halved to 7. You are flung off of the platform."
Zac: Towards the other thing?
"Brennan: Nope, out into space."
Ally: Me?
Brennan: You.
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: Yeah, it's a, sorry, this is actually a Strength saving throw, I don't know if that would change it for some people."
"Zac: Oh, Strength versus..."
"Brennan: Yeah, yours would be even higher, you're okay, Ricky."
Ally: Mine would be lower.
"Brennan: Yours would be lower, yeah."
Murph: The rats would get 16 with Strength.
Zac: Can I bolster your throw?
"Brennan: Pete is flung and falling. So on Pete's turn, he will fall into the hurricane."
Lou: I'm sorry?
Murph: You've got a...
"Brennan: On Pete's turn, he will fall into the hurricane."
Lou: Stop saying that like it's okay!
Ally: I have a shield.
Zac: Do you have any movement things?
Ally: Any what?
Zac: Movement stuff? Like Blink or whatever?
"Murph: I have a way to grab you, but I don't know if, you might go before..."
Ally: I don't have any spell slots left for using any of those.
"Siobhan: Yeah, maybe I can Puppet you as well."
"Ricky: Ricky, that's gonna be you."
"Murph: Oh, I might be able to, I think I can get you."
Ally: Where are those fuckin' spiders at? They can just web us to where we're standing.
"Siobhan: Right, yeah."
"Murph: I could get,"
"Siobhan: Tie us, tie us down, it would be nice."
Zac: Do you guys think you can get him or not?
Murph: We don't have giant insects.
Zac: Do y'all think you can grab Pete or not?
Murph: I think I can maybe grab Pete.
"Lou: I have a last, last, last resort."
Zac: I don't know that I can do it without just falling off the edge myself.
"Emily: Pete, don't you have, do you have Gust or anything that you just blow yourself on course?"
"Ally: I wish. I have, as far as spell slots go..."
"Zac: Okay, I'm gonna say, with Haste, maybe, [laughs] can I, is there any way that makes sense to you, using my movement to get Pete out of the air, just 'cause I feel like I've gotta, 'cause he's sort of in the wrong direction it feels like."
"Brennan: So, you could..."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: Wait until the next spin. Actually, this one spins clockwise, this one spins counter-clockwise. Pete is headed towards here, but the length of that section means that on the next spin, there will be a moment where Pete could be moved and shoved on to the moving platform."
Siobhan: Hold your movement until then.
"Zac: I'll hold my movement 'til then, and I'll say,"
"Ricky: Em, can you, when you can, can you fly me up there?"
"Zac: To, pointing at the."
"Brennan: Em nods and says,"
Em: I can get you up there as fast as I can.
"Brennan: And then you, so that's free to speak."
"Zac: And I have Haste, so can I just, as part, that's part of my action, so can I still just take an attack on this tornado? Just to see what happens?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you absolutely can. You also can, and so you, it's an action to ready an action, so you can use your Haste action to ready an action. Use your normal action, you just spoke, which is free. And you also have a bonus action left."
"Zac: Oh I'm, is there anyone else to call?"
Ally: Yeah.
Lou: Yeah.
Zac: I'll call...
Siobhan: Don Confetti.
Zac: Don Confetti. I'll say Don Confetti.
"Murph: Oh, a pixie would be great."
Emily: Yeah.
Murph: Although they're little.
Siobhan: But at least he can fly.
"Zac: Yeah, Don Confetti."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: And yeah, I don't have any fuckin' spell slots left."
Ally: Yeah.
Siobhan: What were all of our fights that we did?
"Ally: Wait, if I'm dreamless and I'm immune to sleep related harm, does that mean that this tornado won't necessarily fuck with me?"
"Brennan: No, it'll fuck with you."
Ally: Okay.
Emily: Do you have a spell for...
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: You're coming back, dude. You're not done."
"Brennan: You summon, you pull Don Confetti through the portal. Boom. He appears. [whooshing]"
"Don Confetti: Oh, what the fuck is going on here? Why have you done this to me?"
Ricky: I'm so sorry.
Don Confetti: You dirty backstabber.
Ricky: Everything's going to end if we don't kill this thing.
"Brennan: Cool, awesome."
"Ally: Oh, I can shoot my gun when I get close to the platform, maybe."
Zac: Push yourself closer.
"Ally: Yeah, if I just need a nudge. Five feet?"
"Brennan: So Ricky, that's you. And you have an action readied, you also have an action you want to use if you want to take a swing at the tornado."
Zac: I guess I'll fuckin' attack the tornado.
"Brennan: You swing at the tornado. Whoo, passes through wind."
Zac: I won't even roll. [laughs]
Murph: What's more American than a firefighter swinging an ax at a tornado?
"Siobhan: It's a fuckin' mall, Brad."
"Zac: Can I take a Perception roll and just to look at the American Dream to see how fucked up it is, if at all? 19, plus perception. 24."
"Brennan: Oh, 24? And what are you looking at specifically?"
"Zac: I just want to see how hurt is it, if at all. I think it's been barely hurt at all."
"Brennan: It's been barely hurt. It's been hurt, but barely. That's Ricky's turn."
Emily: The tornado or the angel?
"Zac: I was talking about the angel, right?"
"Brennan: The angel, yeah."
Emily: I only hit him for 11.
"Ally: I hit him twice, but they were both halved."
Zac: And then the rats did not hit him yet.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yes, so the portal..."
Zac: Santa's attack.
Siobhan: And Santa's attack as well.
"Brennan: And Santa's attack, yeah,"
"Emily: Oh, so all that did nothing."
"Brennan: Santa hurt him as well. Cool. Spin happens, Ricky, you have your prepared action. You, this one goes clockwise. [humming] You rush, fling yourself off of here, just as..."
Zac: Say run on the wall and kick off. [laughs]
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: [whispering] Nice, nice, nice."
Brennan: I'll get this out of here real quick.
Lou: This is some...
Siobhan: Fuckin’...
Lou: Rick is crazy!
"Brennan, in the process of shifting the battlefield, accidentally knocks over the American Dream."
Brennan: No!
"Siobhan: Goodbye, he's dead!"
Lou: The American Dream.
"Siobhan: He fell, we won."
"Lou: Yeah, what if we made him fall, would that be an unofficial..."
Murph: His little foot broke.
Brennan: Hm?
Murph: His foot.
Brennan: His little foot...
Lou: Did the foot break off?
"Siobhan: Oh, he's dead!"
Lou: He can’t walk anymore cause that’s damage...
Emily: His foot broke off?
Lou: You gotta roll a d6 for that! You gotta roll a d6 for that!
Siobhan: Here's his head.
Ally: I'll do it for you.
"Brennan: Thank you, hold on."
Ally: 4.
"Lou: Takes 4 damage, dude, you gotta…"
"Siobhan: It’s rules, it’s canon."
"Emily: I'm just gonna add, since I'm dead, I have radiant damage."
"Lou: I'm gonna roll one of these, the one that's 10, he takes 40 damage."
"Emily: I forgot, since I'm having sex with my husband in the afterlife..."
"Lou: You take another 4. Oh, and I forgot, I think that's just the damage you have to take when your foot falls off, that's another 4."
Brennan: Spectacular.
Emily: It's embarrassing when people see you and your shoes are off.
Lou: Psychosis damage.
"Brennan: Ricky, you, I'm gonna need an Athletics roll from you to be able to catch, I'm gonna say it's a DC 15 to catch Pete."
"Zac: Athletics, okay. And do I, advantage on Dex throws."
"Brennan: This is, no, this is Strength."
Zac: All right.
[suspenseful music]
Ally: And you're Blessed.
"Zac: 13, a Dex saving throw?"
"Brennan: No, no, no, this is Athletics check."
"Zac: Oh, an athletics check. I got… That's only a 13."
"Siobhan: [whispering] Fuck, man."
"Brennan: Pete, you're still alive, right?"
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: You may make a DC15 Dexterity saving throw.
"Emily: Oh, use some sorcery points, and you're Blessed!"
Siobhan: And you’re Blessed.
"Zac: And wait, can you Bend Luck for me?"
"Ally: Nat 20! Nat 20, nat 20, nat 20! [laughs] Get us out of here!"
"Siobhan: Take it all back, take it all back!"
Lou: Jesus.
Siobhan: All of your plans.
Lou: I can't with this.
"Ricky: My workout buddy, dude!"
"Siobhan: Oh my God, you're so buff now!"
Ally: I am so buff now!
Siobhan: Rowan is so impressed by whatever it is you're about to do.
Lou: [fanning himself nervously] Good God.
Ally: Good.
"Brennan: Ricky, you get Pete out of his dead fall, but in doing so, you move him but not yourself. You begin to fall, until Pete, you're holding on to Pete's leg."
Siobhan: Oh my God.
"Brennan: Pete, you do not make it to standing, you are instead hanging off the edge of this platform."
Siobhan: [singing] I'm on the edge! Of glory!
"Brennan: [screams] Hell yeah. Whoo, bam. [screams] Spinning in the trail, [screams]"
"Pete: I got you, dog!"
Ally: We're like this.
"Ricky: I know you got it, dude!"
"Pete: Thanks, man! Hey, where's your dog?"
Zac: Just fully crying again.
"Pete: Oh, I'm so sorry, dude."
Ricky: It's fine! He's made of light. Still makes me so sad.
Pete: [laughs] Aw!
"Brennan: Kugrash, I'm gonna need you to make a Dexterity saving throw."
[suspenseful music]
Lou: That's right.
Murph: That was 15 plus my Dex. 19.
Sofia: Oh no.
Murph: [whispers] Fuck.
Brennan: 10...
Ally: Where even are you?
Brennan: 19...
Emily: Over there.
Brennan: 22\. You take 28 points of damage.
Murph: I am hurt.
"Brennan: [blast] As you are lit up by the American Dream again. You see, buh- buh-bum. That is going to be... [laughs]"
Ally: That church lady's hat of Rats is so funny.
"Brennan: Kingston, that goes back to you."
Lou: Great. I'd like to sprint up these stairs and get to the other side...
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: Of Sofie, as I'm running up the stairs, I'd like to yell to the gate,"
"Kingston: La Gran Gata, your champion needs you!"
Brennan: And then I will cast Revivify on Sofie Bikes.
Ally: Yeah!
Emily: Does that mean I come back?
Brennan: You come back.
[Emily screams]
"Lou: Yeah, I burned a fourth level..."
Sofia: I was fucking Dale! I was lying there on a choir of angels. [laughs]
Brennan: La Gran Gata bursts...
Ally: And a choir?
"Brennan: La Gran Gata bursts from the portal, it bursts from the portal, he says,"
"La Gran Gata: Your fight is not yet over. Mija, you have much scratching me to do."
Brennan: If you can go place La Gran Gata over there.
"[Emily laughs, claps]"
Lou: Murderer's Row right here.
"Brennan: Murderer's Row? That's Kingston. It's gonna be Esther's turn. She's still got the Haste going, so she's got her concentration. She goes, you see that she sprints, can I see her real quick?"
[dramatic music]
Brennan: Let me take this out here.
"Lou: [whispers] Esther, do not fuck this up. You've gotta make this."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You see that she runs, Esther is a fit Warmage, but she's still a fuckin' nerd, so you see her sprinting, you're worried about her getting to that thing. You see that she looks at you, as you're opening your eyes, she goes,"
"Esther: Glad you're back in the fight, girl."
Emily has her mouth wide open in delight.
"Brennan: [grunts] And goes, whoom, whoom, and throws three spinning circles of neon runes in the void, and jumps, striding each time, boom, boom, boom! Making a little three rock bridge for herself."
Siobhan: Amazing.
"Emily: Yeah, girl!"
"Brennan: Lands here, lands here, sees that you made the jump off of here and you see her go like,"
"Esther: [speaking quick math calculations] All right,"
"Brennan: Whoom! And five, [magical explosions] diagonal steps appear in the air, leading up to the angel. [explosion]"
"Sofia: Yeah, that's my fuckin' girl!"
Esther: You know what to do!
[Emily laughs]
"Sofia: Yes, I just love fighting with her!"
"Brennan: Alejandro sees the same thing, he stands up from prone, if someone wants to stand him up next to those rats. Whose rats are those, those are Kugrash's rats?"
"Lou: I think they were, yeah."
Zac: Whose rats are these?
"Siobhan: Excuse me, madam? Madam, are these your rats?"
"Brennan: You can't leave your rats lying all over the battlefield, gang! Alejandro stands up, and goes,"
Alejandro: [points at Sofia] You've got this.
Sofia: Thank you! I know I do.
Brennan: And hits you with Protection From Good and Evil. [sound of sparkling]
Zac: [whispering] Oh my God.
"Sofia: Hoo, I'm so buffed!"
[Ally laughs]
Brennan: Buh-buh-bum.
Kingston: I watched your lungs fly out of you earlier. But I'm glad you're back and feeling it.
Pete: That was horrifying when we found out that you were dead.
[Emily laughs]
"Rowan: It was bad for us, I'm glad you had a good time with your husband..."
Kingston: I’m glad you feel good. We all had to watch you die.
Brennan: This fire tornado moves right over here to Ricky and Pete.
Zac: Come on!
Murph: Shit!
Lou: Come on.
Brennan: I'm gonna need Dex saves with disadvantage from both of you.
Zac: I have advantage.
Brennan: So that means you're gonna roll a flat dex save.
"Ally: Does it give me advantage too, or that's just you?"
"Zac: I think it's just me, 'cause I have Haste on me."
Brennan: Yeah.
Lou: Yeah you...
Siobhan: But you do get an extra 4 from his Aura of Protection. Goddamn. I thought you said that this die was the one that was cursed! It's this one! That one has rolled so many nat 1s in this game.
"Ally: Oh, but I also have Bless."
"Brennan: Yeah, roll Bless. Let me know what you roll."
Ally: 5.
Zac: 11.
"Ally: Oh, and I add..."
Brennan: 11.
"Ally: Dex, you say?"
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Ally: Oh cool, that's..."
Zac: You add 4 to this.
Siobhan: Plus 4 from Ricky.
Ally: 12.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Am I in danger of being thrown off? Or should I...
Brennan: The fire doesn't appear to have the same wind thing...
Zac: Okay. Cool.
Brennan: That anything else does. I'm rolling like trash over here.
Zac: Good! [laughs]
"Ally: Yeah, exactly. [fakely] Oh, I feel so bad!"
Brennan: You each take 20 points of damage.
Ally: Mine's halved with my armor?
"Brennan: Yours is 10, yep. So whoom, as you are immolated over there by the tornado moving..."
Zac: 20 you said?
"Brennan: 20, yeah. Great. That is going to be Kugrash."
"Murph: Sweet. Okay. Can, ah… Doo doo doo doo doo. Can I use my Haste thing after a short rest? 'Cause I used my watch during the last fight."
Brennan: You can use it again after a short rest.
"Murph: Okay, until the spell ends, puts you at advantage on dexterity saving throws. Okay. I think… I'm gonna do that, 'cause I'm very slow and it will be hard for me to, maybe I could get up in the mix. How hurt is everybody?"
Emily: I have 1 hit point.
"Murph: Jesus Christ, okay. I'm running for Sofie. So I am gonna have to take a full dash to get to her."
Zac: Are her little steps still there?
"Brennan: Esther is holding this, she's got Haste running on you and is actively using her actions to hold these laser grid, [thudding] rune manhole cover of Gramercy Occult Society steps that are, they're not level, they're like tom toms almost hanging at diagonals in the air for you to spring off of and jump up."
Siobhan: This is the American Ninja Warrior Dream.
"Murph: So with Haste, would it be smarter for me to, so my speed is already doubled, and I get another action. So could I potentially, 'cause Kugrash doesn't have great Athletics, I think I'd rather make this jump than this jump."
"Brennan: You're trying to make which jump? Oh, you're trying to go..."
Murph: I think I'd rather...
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, understood."
Murph: 'Cause I can run very far.
"Brennan: Yeah, jumping, getting up higher to jump down to something that is closer will be much easier for sure."
"Murph: I would like to do that, 'cause I think I have basically 100 feet of movement if I use a dash action."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Okay, so..."
Zac: What is that wolf?
Brennan: That's just the unicorn.
"Zac: Oh, oh."
Murph: So how many can I move if I can move...
Siobhan: Idiot. Can't you tell that wolf is a unicorn?
Murph: 20 spaces?
"Brennan: 20 spaces, yeah."
"Murph: Okay, so one, two, three..."
"Brennan: That's difficult terrain. So that's three, four."
Murph: Five...
Brennan: Six.
"Murph: Seven, eight… Nine, 10."
Brennan: That's 50.
Murph: And then I can jump?
"Brennan: Yeah, jump."
Murph: Okay. Down here.
"Brennan: Cool. Go ahead and make an Athletics check for me, or acrobatics."
"Murph: All right, Acrobatics would be better. 9."
Brennan: You take 5 points of falling damage.
"Murph: Okay. Hurt. So what did I say, that was 10 or 11?"
Brennan: That's 11 down there.
"Murph: Okay, that's fine. 12, 23, I just want to get up next to Sofie here."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: Can you move your unicorn as a bonus action?
"Murph: Yes, which is what I'm also gonna do. So then I'm gonna move the unicorn."
Zac: Is that a bonus action or just something else?
"Murph: That's a bonus action. So bonus action, I can move the unicorn within 60 feet. So I'm gonna move it to the center..."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Of all of us.
Brennan: Dope.
Murph: Bink! And then I'm going to cast a second level Cure Wounds on Sofie. Healing everyone in the aura for 10.
Siobhan: Nice.
"Brennan: Whoa, and how big is the aura?"
Murph: 30 feet.
Brennan: Radius?
"Murph: Yes, aura. I think it's a circle."
Brennan: Oh shit. That is everybody. Everybody on the center platform including Ricky and Pete are healed for 10.
Emily: Oh my God!
Ally: Oh fuck yeah!
Emily: That aura!
Ally: That's amazing.
Emily: Your auras!
Lou: My man knows what he's doing.
"Siobhan: Yeah, you'd think that your aura's pretty..."
Zac: Beautiful aura.
Siobhan: Disgusting.
Ally: What color aura do you think that is?
"Siobhan: Oh my god, just like purple and blue."
Brennan: Esther was looking fucked up. Esther was looking hurt. She's healed as well.
Murph: 12 to you.
Emily: Oh 12 to me.
"Brennan: Plus the 10 from unicorn, right?"
"Emily: Plus the 10. Oh my, wow!"
"Ally: Hell yeah, that's amazing."
"Sofia: Thanks, Kug, you earned yourself a fuckin' another free makeover."
Kugrash: I'll take it!
Ally: [laughs] I'd love it.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: And then I think I still have a little bit of movement left, I'm kinda squishy. So I think I'm gonna, beep, beep, beep. Just hide back around the corner."
"Brennan: Gotcha. Cool, cool, cool."
"Emily: This is a big difference, I was thinking I was definitely just gonna die immediately again, but this is, I might not."
Lou: I like the sound of that. I can get down with that.
[Emily laughs]
Ally: And now we have stone steps.
"Lou: Yeah, all of us can climb up. Kingston's... [weak grunts, pretending to climb]"
Ally: Thank you!
[Lou grunts]
Ally: Esther!
"Brennan: Laying a finger aside of his nose, jolly old St. Nick..."
Zac: Aside of his nose?
Brennan: If someone wants to hand me old St. Nick here.
Ally: He's doing a bunch of coke. [laughs]
[Emily laughs]
Zac: Snow!
Ally: Santa gets keyed up and lunges into the dream tornado.
"Brennan: You see that Santa flies over here, whoo, you see he's like,"
"Santa: Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!"
"Brennan: Looks down at Stephen Sondheim, and he says,"
Santa: Mr. Sondheim! You've been a very good little boy!
"Brennan: Reaches into his sack, and throws down two full four and a half foot long broadswords."
Ally: Fuck!
Zac: What is he?
[sound of swords scraping]
"Stephen Sondheim’s mini changes to a different mini, where he is in a running action pose and dual-wielding massive broadswords."
Brennan: Stephen Sondheim...
Siobhan: What!
"Ally: What, no! That's not just a mini that you had!"
Siobhan: You already had that planned!?
Lou: That's one of the coolest things that you've ever done!
Siobhan: That is incredible.
"Lou: Straight up, that's one of the most amazing things…"
Siobhan: So cool.
Zac: I apologize.
Lou: That you've ever done.
Zac: I apologize.
Lou: Straight up?
Ally: Thank you!
Emily: What if we hadn't called Stephen Sondheim!
"Lou: This fight is incredible, that's honestly one of the coolest things, not only to make Stephen Sondheim a character, then to give him two broadswords. Respect."
"Ally: You see that he goes, he goes..."
Zac: I apologize.
Sondheim: Nicholas...
Ally: I'm happy you feel that way.
Brennan: He goes...
Zac: Okay!
"Sondheim: Nicholas, I feel terrible. I didn't get you anything. Oh wait. I did."
Brennan: And winks..
Ally: If Santa has two broadswords...
"Brennan: [laughs] You see that he, he winks at Santa Claus, and Santa Claus blushes, and he says,"
Sondheim: A musical Miracle on 34th Street? Has anyone thought about it? Could be good. Anyway...
"Brennan: Whoom! [sound of swords] Whoom whoom whoom, whoom, whoom! Ching- ching-ching-ching-ching! Does this incredible sword dance and goes,"
Sondheim: [singing] These are my friends! [jazz hands]
Brennan: That's going to be Pete.
Ally: Really?
"Brennan: Yeah, it's you!"
"Ally: Oh no. I would like to get up and pull Ricky with me, 'cause I'm so fucking buff now."
"Zac: Yeah, we have advantage on ability checks, right?"
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, within the aura of the..."
"Murph: No that's not on, not the unicorn."
Zac: It's not a unicorn?
"Murph: No, the spicy, the cockroach does that."
Ally: Spicy cockroach.
Murph: The Juicy Cockroach. Spicy Pidgeon.
"Ally: Spicy, oh yeah! [laughs]"
Murph: Spicy Pidgeon.
"Ally: Okay, I would like to pull Pete up, please."
Brennan: This is gonna be a DC20 Athletics check.
Ally: I have a one to Athletics.
Brennan: You've gotta roll a 19 or a 20 to pull Ricky up.
"Zac: But what happens if you fail, though?"
"Brennan: Pete would not fall, but there would be a, if you rolled, if you got a 1 you would fall."
Siobhan: What about if you wait for Ricky's movement and Ricky can just...
"Zac: If you say help, can you give me the Help action for when it's my turn?"
"Brennan: You could give the Help action, you can also, you're hanging on for dear life, but you could also cast a spell or take another action just hanging here."
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could do that. Okay, I..."
Emily: Shoot that fucker!
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: But it's, you are also hanging on for dear life, if this thing spins again, you'll have to roll to not be flung off into nothingness."
Zac: Oh God.
Ally: I'll fuckin' roll.
"Brennan: All right, let's see,"
Emily: It spun after...
Ally: 19! 19!
[cheering]
Ally stands up out of their seat and punches the air.
Ally: Yeah!
Emily: Yeah!
"Ally: Come on, buddy!"
Emily: Goddamn!
"Ricky: Keep going, keep going!"
"Siobhan: Oh, he's so buff!"
Emily: You have the most poetic rolls!
[Ally laughs]
"Brennan: Pete, your med bracelet, the source of your arcane focus glows, of all the pills on it, the testosterone pops open, and a pill wearing a little army helmet pops out and goes,"
"Pill: [army sergeant voice] Come on, boys! Pete needs us!"
"Brennan: And a stream of them, hut, hut, hut! Leap into your open mouth. [gagging on pills] Your muscles, [bursting]"
Zac: It’s like Popeye!
"Brennan: I'm gonna say free Wild Magic surge, your Strength is 20 for the rest of combat."
Ally: Fuck yes!
"Brennan: Pete is fuckin' ripped, just huge!"
Zac: You said metal ripped!
Ally: That is amazing!
Lou: Chrome and ripped? [laughs]
Ally: That's insane!
"Brennan: Oh yeah, you're like fuckin' Colossus from X-Men, you're a huge, jacked, chrome dream sorcerer man. Fucking, you're as shredded as Ricky."
Siobhan: All your clothes are ripped.
Ricky: Hell yeah dude.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, dude. Fuckin' brothers, dude."
Pete: Glad I switched from the testosterone gel.
[Brennan laughs]
"Zac: I take a picture of you just for a before and after, and just send it to you, so you can post it. [laughs]"
"Pete: Gains all day. Wait, fuck, ew, I never wanted to become that guy."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Cool, that's..."
Pete: I still read! I still read poems!
Brennan: That's just your movement.
Ally: Yeah it is!
"Brennan: But that's your,"
[Zac snaps approvingly]
"Brennan: Hell yeah. And actually, yeah, probably it's half your movement getting up there, so you guys, you actually could take another three spaces of movement if you want."
Ally: Okay.
Emily: You might want to get away from the edge.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I would like to..."
Zac: Can Pete carry me in his arms?
"Brennan: Yeah, you're so fuckin' jacked, you carry Ricky like a baby."
Ally: I carry Ricky like a baby to the center of the thing so we stop spinning around.
Brennan: Gotcha.
Ally: Or as close as...
"Brennan: Yeah, you get there."
"Emily: Oh my God, Pete, you look so badass."
"Ally: And then, let's see, what do I do? I guess I'll throw another Vitriolic Sphere up at Dream."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
Ally: At American Dream. So that's just a Dex saving throw for yours.
"Brennan: Cool. He succeeds on that Dex saving throw, so go ahead and roll that 10d4."
"Ally: Great. Could I have a million d4s again, please?"
Lou: Let them just send my son. Send your beautiful children.
"Emily: I’m gonna send, actually this is a different child."
"Ally: I have four. Now I have six. Seven. Eight, nine. One more, please."
"Lou: All right, fine, take my son."
[Emily laughs]
Ally: Give me your sons. All right.
Emily: Let me see how my daughter is doing out there.
Lou: He is going to get another 1. I dont know.
Siobhan: Sophie's Choice over here.
Lou: I don't believe in my son at all.
"Ally rolls, and a bunch of them drop off the table."
Lou: Middling again!
Brennan: Rolling an Ally every time.
"Ally: You know what, everyone?"
Emily: My daughter got a four.
"Brennan: Woo, that's not bad!"
Ally: A bunch of fours.
Emily: Get in there girl.
"Ally: Let's see. So 15. 23, 27. In half."
"Brennan: Ooh damn! This one, you can see this one hurts this angel."
[magical blast]
Ally: Great. And then can I do an Arcana check to see if I can get any more info about what I saw in Moses's office and try to get that rune...
Murph: Oh shit.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Arcana check, absolutely."
"Ally: 16 and 5, 21."
"Brennan: You look around, you suspect that you are inside the phylactery, that this spell is occurring in extra-dimensional space as the, you're catching the Dream in the infinitesimal moment prior to the moment of it entering into the world. If this battle is lost, this thing enters the world and it's all over, folks."
Emily: What did the rune sound like?
"Brennan: You, from that velvet container, from the wooden box with the little velvet on the inside, you know that you are actually in proximity to the phylactery, you could destroy it from here, but you would have to know the whole rest of the sequence."
Ally: With the 20...
Brennan: The 21?
"Ally: Yeah, can I know kind of how to find the rest of the sequence?"
"Brennan: You, yeah, with a 21, researching it from in here is gonna be impossible. In order to destroy the phylactery, you would have to have an amount of, in order to be able to guess the phylactery, you would effectively have to be bordering on omniscient, you would have to be a fuckin', it would be next to impossible."
Zac: Can we just...
"Emily: Let's just all make a bunch of noises, and maybe one of them will be right?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, like monkeys writing Hamlet."
"Lou: Yeah, I’ll just Cure Wounds us, and then we can—"
"Brennan: Yeah, you know that there's a way to do it, but the amount of knowledge required to be able to do that is beyond the scope of imagination. That's Pete, that's your turn. Or that's your check. Any, and then you also have a bonus action if you want."
"Ally: Great. Yeah, I would like to call Nod."
"Brennan: Cool, what does Pete say?"
"Ally: I say,"
"Pete: Nod, on your way in here, try to find out what other runes we need to know! In your infinite wisdom from the dream world!"
"[gentle, dream-like music]"
Brennan: Nod appears. Everybody regains a spell slot of the highest level they are able to cast.
Zac: Oh my God!
"Lou: So you're telling me that a second level, I get a second fifth level..."
"Brennan: You get a fifth, everyone that can cast fifth level..."
Siobhan: Everybody gets a spell!
"Brennan: Nod appears and the raw power of the dream realm courses through everybody, everyone gets a spell slot of their highest one."
Ally: Nod is Oprah. [laughs] Everyone look under your seats! You get a spell!
"Siobhan: Oh my God, I got an Impreza!"
Nod: I'm the most powerful child there has ever been.
Pete: True.
"Brennan: Cool. That's gonna be Nod, Hmm, hmm, hmm. Nod acknowledges that, Nod's gonna make a roll. Make an Insight check."
Ally: Great. Not good. 7.
"Brennan: Nod seems to have the information that, or a piece of the information that you asked Nod to get before coming here. And you see that they look very sad."
Ally: Can I Mind Link with them?
Brennan: Yes.
"Pete: What is up? What's going on, Nod?"
"Nod: The phylactery, we're already inside, we cannot see the outside of it."
"Brennan: You see that Nod is busy sort of channeling magic, but is going to tell you, but is like, it's hard to communicate the information. But Nod does appear, you all get that spell slot. And it's time for another spin!"
[Siobhan sings carousel music]
Zac: What a turn. [laughs]
"Brennan: What a turn! I know, this combat, right?"
"Lou: Yeah, what a turn! [groans]"
"Sofia: Oy, oy!"
Ally: Are you okay? Are you okay?
"Lou: Blood, blood, blood. [pretends blood is coming out of his mouth]"
Brennan: You guys see Alejandro is knocked prone over here at the very edge.
Lou: Even with Bless?
Brennan: Hm?
Lou: Even with Bless?
Brennan: Even with Bless.
"Lou: [whispering] I had to fuckin', I Blessed that man."
"Ally: This is the most insane tableau. Like with the characters here, there's like, Santa on a riser."
Zac: Stephen Sondheim with two swords.
Ally: Two broadswords!
Brennan: That is going to be...
Emily: Do you have a mini for Ruth Bader Ginsberg? Can we summon her? One of the heroes?
"Brennan: I mean, it's too risky to bring her to this battle."
"Ally: Yeah, absolutely not. [laughs]"
"Lou: Also, if RBG…"
Emily: Oh God.
"Siobhan: Oh, no."
Ally: [praying hands] Once again. Rest in Power.
Siobhan: Let's take a moment to pray for the soul of Ruth Bader Ginsberg.
Zac: Who is still alive.
"Siobhan: [praying hands] And more importantly, the body of Ruth Bader Ginsberg."
"Brennan shakes a big handful of dice, then rolls."
"Murph: Yipes, who's getting shot?"
"Brennan: [whispering] 12, 30, 33. Kingston takes 41 points of damage."
Lou: Mm-hmm.
Murph: What are you at?
Zac: Are you still standing?
Lou: Yeah. I'm at 33.
Zac: Okay.
[blast]
Brennan: As he sends another rocketing ray of fire. You are partially protected by Alejandro's Protection From Good and Evil.
Lou: That went away.
"Brennan: Oh, that's right, that went away, that's right, yep. You are not protected from that. You see Alejandro stands up. Alejandro stands up, looks at you, bloodied and bludgeoned, he goes,"
Alejandro: My friend! [laughs] This tilt-a-whirl is no joke!
"Brennan: And yells out at you, the angel immolates, destroys these rats."
Murph: No!
[blast]
"Brennan: Turns to look at Alejandro. Its eyes, whoom, go bright. Alejandro looks up to meet the angel's gaze. A ray of light erupts from its open eyes. Alejandro is hit in the chest, sent backwards into the tornado, and is gone."
Siobhan: [whispers] Fuck!
[ambient music]
Ally: We can see him mid-fall?
Brennan: He is destroyed.
Zac: Oh!
[whooshing]
"Brennan: You see the magic woven into his coat, and the last thing you see is the golden glint of his eye. [whooshing] Which lingers in the air a moment after he is gone. The angel turns to you and says,"
American Dream: There can be no life for those who would stand against me. Submit or face the same fate.
"Brennan: That is going to be Willy's turn. Two, three four. [blast] Stands here. Stands in the middle of the platform facing the angel, lifts a giant brick fist and flips off the angel in the sky."
"Willy: Go fuck yourself, chew my brick asshole, you prick bitch!"
Brennan: Willy moves there. That's going to be Rowan.
Siobhan: Is there any way for me using Esther's steps to get within 60 feet of the angel?
Brennan: You'd have to make an Acrobatics check to get up there.
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, Acrobatics, yeah, I can do that. That's fine."
"Brennan: Okay, it's gonna be a DC20 acrobatics check."
"Siobhan: Okay, so I just need to get a 9 or higher. I do not get a 9 or higher, I get a 6."
Brennan: You do have that inspo from your boy Sondheim.
Siobhan: I do have that inspo from my boy Sondheim!
"Siobhan rolls her Bardic Inspiration, then shakes her head a little bit."
Brennan: Not gonna do it?
Zac: How close are you?
"Siobhan: Yeah, I got an 18, so I needed to get a 20."
Brennan: You need to get a 20. You get up part of the way.
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: You're up here.
Siobhan: That's fine. So can I then cast Puppet?
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: I would like to attempt to cast Puppet on the angel, which is a Constitution saving throw."
Brennan: Okay. He succeeds.
"Siobhan: Well fuck me. Is the door still open or now Alejandro is gone, is the door gone?"
Brennan: The portal is gone.
[sound of flame]
[spooky music]
"Siobhan: Okay. In which case… [sighs] Okay. I am going to turn to Pete, and be like,"
Rowan: That was really cool what you just did.
[sound of shimmering]
Siobhan: And give Pete Bardic Inspiration.
"Pete: Oh, thank you! [laughs] Fuck!"
Rowan: You look really buff right now.
"Pete: Thanks! Yeah, I have been working out for a while. It is nice to see the body change, I do feel really like myself."
Siobhan: I reach out to feel your pecs.
"Ricky: It happens all at once. It's like, you don't notice."
"Pete: It's like nothing at all, and then boom, all at once. Yeah, totally."
Siobhan: Biceps.
Pete: Yeah. [clears throat]
"Brennan: That is Rowan's turn. Sofia, that's gonna be you."
"Emily: Okay. Tipsy Sway, pop right back up."
"Brennan: Five feet of movement, yep."
"Emily: I just want to book it up, up them stairs."
"Brennan: Rad, let's see..."
Emily: Do I need to use Step of the Wind to get to him?
"Brennan: You might need to do it to take a dash, yeah."
"Emily: Yeah, okay."
"Brennan: 'Cause let's see, 'cause your movement's 45, right?"
Emily: Yeah. [banging] Ooh!
"Brennan: Yeah, so yeah, you would need two movement increments to make it up there."
Emily: Okay. So Step of the Wind to get up to him.
Murph: Definitely jump off Willy. Just for flavor.
"Emily: Okay, yeah! I go over, I leapfrog over Willy."
"Zac: Willy didn't really do anything, could he throw her?"
"Brennan: Oh, Willy's doing a lot by not doing anything, he's granting everybody advantage on saving throws five feet around him, and preparing actions to catch people if they fly off and stuff."
"Zac: Gotcha, gotcha."
"Brennan: Willy's a defense player, you know what I mean?"
Lou: Right.
"Emily: So I get up there, so that's my bonus, right?"
Brennan: That's your bonus.
"Emily: Okay, so I use up my bonus. That's fine. Just for future reference, though, would disadvantage on ability checks make him have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws?"
"Brennan: It would. If you can give him disadvantage on saving throws, it would..."
"Emily: Can't right now, 'cause I used my bonus action. So I'm going to..."
"Ally: Man, that would change everything! He's passed all of my shit!"
Emily: I want to so fuckin' bad!
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Rad. You, boom, boom, boom, boom! Esther's keeping the platforms there. [arcane buzzing, footsteps] Go ahead, give me just the, oh actually no, 'cause you don't have difficult terrain, right?"
Emily: No.
"Brennan: Cool, yeah, you get up there easily."
Emily: Okay. And I'm fuckin' going after him!
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: Does a, okay… Does, I think this hits. Does a 16 plus, 25..."
Brennan: 25 hits! Yes it does!
"Emily: Okay! All right, bitch! Gonna hit him for 13 and then I would like to ki point Stunning Strike him."
Brennan: Cool How much damage you do real quick?
Emily: I did a 13.
"Brennan: Cool. Boom, he's gonna make a save."
Emily: Constitution.
"Brennan: And does he have, he doesn't have..."
"Emily: He doesn't have, I didn't get a chance to hex him, I used my bonus action getting up there."
Brennan: Gotcha.
"Emily: So I couldn't ever cast a spell as a reaction, even if it was just bonus action?"
Brennan: Correct. He saves.
"Emily: Saves, fucker. Okay, I'm going after him again. Does a 21 hit?"
Brennan: 21 does hit.
Emily: Yes!
"Brennan: So now we know his AC, his AC is 21."
Murph: Okay.
"Emily: Gonna hit him for another 7, gonna try and Stunning Strike him again!"
"Zac: Oh, do you get radiant damage on these?"
"Emily: Yeah, I'm adding them."
"Brennan: Oh, sorry. Let me know..."
"Emily: So I hit him for another 15, sorry."
"Brennan: Another 15, gotcha."
"Emily: Another 15, I want to Stunning Strike him again."
"Brennan: Cool, hold on one second."
Zac: I think the radiant damage might do more.
Siobhan: He probably has resistance to radiant damage.
"Emily: Oh, 2 of those are radiant damage."
Brennan: He's gonna make another save. Passes.
"Emily: Fucker! Okay, then I'm gonna fuckin' go at him one more time! I don't hit him. Fucker! [strikes]"
"Brennan: But you do start injuring him. He's beginning to look a lot like, he's… He's beginning to look a little bit staggered or winded."
Emily: Kay.
[thudding]
Ally: We need that disadvantage thing. He has fucking advantage on everything.
"Brennan: You see, charging up behind you, Sofia, you hear,"
Sondheim: Never one to be outdone.
Brennan: Stephen Sondheim...
Sofia: [claps] Oh yay!
"Brennan: Charges up, he says,"
"Sondheim: You get the back, I get the front! What do you say, Ms. Lee?"
Sofia: Sounds good to me!
Siobhan: [giggles] Stupid.
Brennan: And Stephen Sondheim and Sofia Lee start flanking the American Dream...
Emily: Woo! [singing] There are giants in the sky...
"Brennan: Fighting in the sky! Cool. 'Cause you know, you are leaping up to hit him, so you are going to, on your next turn, fall, you'll have to make Dexterity saves, there are platforms underneath you."
"Emily: I'm aware of that. But on his turn, I'm still going to be within five feet of him."
"Brennan: That's right, so at the beginning of your turn, you're gonna take more attacks, and then you're gonna fall. Cool. Sondheim's gonna make some attacks."
Emily: Is Sondheim also jumping or is he just straight up flying?
"Brennan: No, he's jumping."
Emily: Whoa!
Brennan: Huge bounding leaps with these two broadswords.
Ally: He's attacking another Sondheim.
Siobhan: I think he's a Song or Swords bard.
Brennan: Yeah. [laughs] Cool.
Ally: Did he make attacks?
"Brennan: He does. You see he skewers the angel for some more damage, he's like, sliding a broadsword through his chest that gleams with some of Santa's magical energy. He goes,"
"Sondheim: Sharp and cutting, that's how I like my wit and my blades! [sound of twirling blade]"
Brennan: That is going to be Confetti.
[Murph laughs]
"Sofia: Confetti, could you just come hold me up here, so I could use my fuckin' bonus action to hex this motherfucker?"
Ricky: Can you Tails him to Sonic?
Brennan: You...
"Sofia: Confetti, you kinda owe me."
Siobhan: The girl in Donkey Kong 2.
Ally: Oh yeah.
Zac: Dixie?
Lou: She's up.
"Brennan: You see, hold on a second. You see Don Confetti go,"
"Don Confetti: Of course, I would be completely happy to assist you in any way I can. Ha!"
Emily: Oh shit.
Brennan: And flies right into the subway.
Siobhan: Fucking coward!
"Emily: I forgot one thing, he has, when I, 'cause I'm a Mage Slayer, he actually has disadvantage on saving throws to make, not on saving throws, but to maintain concentration. If he has any spells that have concentration, he would have had to had disadvantage."
"Brennan: So, make a couple saving throws, gotcha."
"Emily: Not on saving throws, disadvantage on concentration saving throws."
Brennan: Gotcha.
Emily: In case any of these...
Siobhan: That's an amazing feat.
"Brennan: It's very good. He maintains, I'm gonna need you to make a Dexterity saving throw for me."
[suspenseful music]
Emily: Okay.
[Lou laughs]
Emily: How's a 28 sound?
Brennan: You take no damage whatsoever.
"[Emily claps, laughs]"
Emily: Did he just cast a spell?
"Brennan: No, he has an active spell on him."
"Emily: Okay. Oh, if that was a spell, I actually get advantage on saving throws against spells."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: When I'm within five feet.
"Brennan: Gotcha. Sondheim takes some damage. [grunts, whooshing] As light slashes into him. That's going to be..."
Siobhan: Has Em gone?
"Brennan: Confetti, Em is going now."
Murph: Confetti ran away?
Brennan: Confetti did run away.
Ally: Little fucker.
Zac: Of course.
"Lou: Hey, it was a lot to hope..."
Zac: Was she...
Emily: It was a nice try.
"Zac: I wonder if she wanted to pick me up or not, but maybe I run up those stairs."
"Siobhan: I mean, it's still pretty cool to be carried by an angel."
Brennan: You're actually very...
Zac: I may be too far away to do it.
Brennan: You are quite far away from where she is.
"Sofia: Em, you could come hold me so I could have, so I don't have to use a bonus action to get up every time, and then I could hex this motherfucker and he'd get disadvantage on constitution."
"Brennan: She actually is going to make, she flies up with a reaction, and does a little basket scoop with her legs flying underneath you."
Emily: Yes!
"Brennan: That's, buh-buh-bum."
Emily: Love seeing an Angel just like in... [laughs]
Brennan: That's gonna be...
Siobhan: Alley-oop’ing you.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: These, roll a dex save for these rats over here, if you'd be so kind."
Murph: Oh no!
"Lou: Oh, that's right!"
Murph: They can't do much. 6.
Brennan: They are flung into oblivion.
"Murph: Bye, guys."
Siobhan: It's been nice.
Brennan: That is...
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: That is gonna be, 40, so these are gonna move over here. [wind whistling] Then, and actually, this is moving up, actually. Put it on a little riser. [wind whistling] That is the wind. La Gran Gata."
Emily: Ooh!
Zac: Yes!
"Sofia: Come on, girl! Show 'em what you got! Girl, guy, I don't remember. Whatever you want to be. Here, kitty kitty. [laughs]"
Siobhan: Pick it up and look at its butt.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: You see that La Gran Gata goes,"
"La Gran Gata: [growling] Mija, you're doing fine. Let's get you some help."
"Brennan: And, whoo, [strike] turns into that whirlwind of sparkle around Ricky."
Emily: Yeah!
Brennan: It's going to help you move.
"Zac: Okay, cool."
[wind whistling]
Brennan: You have an extra move action on your turns.
Murph: Nice!
Brennan: So you're Hasted and have an extra move.
"Zac: Tight, and I have Freedom of Movement."
"Brennan: Yeah, you have Freedom of Movement. You can boogie. That's La Gran Gata, Ricky, that's you, baby."
Zac: Okay. Ricky is...
Siobhan: Take me with you!
Ally: Fireman's hold?
Emily: Yeah!
Zac: Do you think I could take...
"Rowan: [cutely] Oh my god, pick me up, Mr. March!"
Zac: I'm pretty strong. Could I move all the way to him with Freedom of Movement and whatever that thing is?
"Brennan: So yes, you have an extra 30. So it's 60."
Zac: And up these steps.
"Ally: Yeah, Haste gives you a lot."
"Brennan: And you have, so you'd probably have to use your Haste action to take that extra action."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: 90 can definitely get you to him.
"Ally: Well, your speed is doubled with Haste."
Brennan: Oh!
Ally: And then you get an extra action.
"Brennan: And you get an extra move! So you actually do 60, oh, you're, Ricky is a blinding bolt of glowing light. [wind whistling] We are having a real sky battle, gang! Ricky, you..."
Lou: Nobody can fly.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a Athletics with advantage.
"Zac: Okay, great. Nat 20."
Brennan: Oh God.
[cheering]
Lou: Oh God.
Brennan: Hell yeah. [placing Ricky’s mini on a big standee for height] Here we go.
"Siobhan: Man, I hope you got more of these sticks."
Ally: This is some Radio Shack.
Zac: We're getting a great signal right now.
Ally: Yeah! [laughs] We're stealing so much cable!
"Murph: You have, you have fuckign Smite back."
"Brennan: Look at this shit, it's a fight in the sky! How do you not like that?"
Siobhan: It's great.
[footfalls]
"Brennan: That's go, so Ricky, that's your move. That takes, that's just your movement and your extra movement, so you actually have an action and an action left."
Ally: Fuckin' Don Confetti.
Zac: I'm going to speak with my axe.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Zac: And just ask it, do you think I should, should I use it now?"
"Emily: Oh, you had that super secret card!"
"Brennan: You see that the questing blade says,"
[ambient music]
"Axe: I would only use that power, master, in the most dire of circumstances. If you feel that the battle could yet sway in your favor, I would see you hold on."
"Zac: I'm going to, hmm. I'll use, can I use, can I try to grapple him?"
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely, you can try to grapple him."
Zac: I'm trying to decide what… Can I make a Perception check of how hurt he is?
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: It's two 12s. 17.
Brennan: Cool. He's hurt. He looks hurt.
"Zac: Okay. I'm just going to attack him, then."
Brennan: Dope. Go ahead and give me a Dexterity saving throw.
Zac: Okay. I have advantage on that. I got a 20.
"Brennan: 20, cool. You take, 11, 17. You take 26 points of slashing damage as you enter the range of this spell by getting close to the Dream."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: Cool. But go ahead and take your attacks.
"Zac: Okay, so..."
"Ally: Let's go, Ricky!"
"Zac: I, [sighs] I'm trying to decide if I want to use one of those attacks to grapple him, does that make any sense? Hmm. I'm just gonna take the first two swings at him."
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
[dramatic music]
"Zac: That's two misses I think, 'cause a 20, no, no, 24."
"Emily: Ooh, yeah."
"Zac: 24 hits, right?"
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: 24 does hit, yes."
Zac: And I'll use the third level Divine Smite on him.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
Zac: And does it seem like it will do more damage to him?
Brennan: You're not sure if the radiant will do more. You're not sure.
Zac: So that would be third level is...
Brennan: Is gonna be 4d8. Yep.
Murph: Plus your regular attack.
Brennan: So it's 5d8 plus 8 damage.
"Zac: Cool, can I have some d8s?"
Ally: Yeah!
One of the tornado minis falls over and knocks into the standees of the flying players and the American Dream. Nothing else falls over.
"Brennan: Oh no! Wow, incredible, that could've been so much worse!"
Ally: Do you need another one?
"Lou: Yeah, I'm amazed that that didn't, yeah, that should've knocked down all of them."
"Siobhan: Oh my goodness, so precarious."
"Zac: Okay, cool. Cool. So 8, 8, plus 10, 18. Plus..."
Lou: My middling son.
"Emily: [craning to look at Zac’s dice] I can’t see… Oh, 5, 5, I’ll take a 5."
"Zac: 22 plus 8, so 30."
"Brennan: Ooh, hell yeah."
Zac: And yeah.
"Brennan: Incredible. You, whah! Lay into him, badly hurt him with your first swing. That's going to, you can take your second attack."
"Zac: I did two, my second one missed."
"Brennan: Second one missed, first one was 30, cool."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: And then you have your other action from Haste, I believe, right?"
"Zac: Okay. I'm going to, and to grapple, hmm."
Brennan: Grappling would mean you wouldn't fall.
Zac: Okay
Brennan: You could hold on to him.
"Zac: Okay, I will grapple. I'll try to grapple him."
Brennan: Yeah.
Emily: Do you get something from Haste for strength?
"Brennan: Go ahead and let me know what you roll for, so it's just an Athletics roll."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: And what you need to beat is a 24.
Zac: [quietly] Okay.
[Siobhan hums]
"Zac: And I don't have Bardic, right? Oh, I forgot to put, okay, so my second attack was 17, Oh, even with a 4, would I hit him?"
Murph: 21.
Ally: 21.
Siobhan: Yeah.
Zac: Can I just roll my Bardic just to make sure? On my second attack?
Siobhan: Your Bless.
"Brennan: Yeah, sure."
"Zac: Yeah, I got a 4."
"Brennan: Oh, you hit him on the second one. Yeah, go for it."
Zac: My second attack would be 2d8.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Zac: That's 8 plus 8, so 16."
Ally: Whoa!
"Brennan: Why is it 2d8, or are you doing another Smite?"
"Zac: That's just a regular, one, oh, whoops, so okay, 6 plus 8."
"Brennan: 6 plus 8, 14, gotcha."
Zac: All right. So that hit. And now I'll do the try to grapple him.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Okay. So that would be, 17 plus 9."
Emily: [gasps] You did it!
"Brennan: 17 plus 9, you did it! 26!"
Siobhan: 26!
Ally: Great.
[Emily claps]
"Brennan: Cool, and you grab on to him, you're not going anywhere!"
Zac: Cool.
Brennan: Incredible. That's gonna be another spin.
Lou: Nod!
Ally: How?
"As the platform is spun, it knocks into Em’s standee and nearly knocks her over."
Siobhan: Oop!
"Brennan: We're good. We are good, gang."
Emily: [whispering to Siobhan as she tries to give a borrowed die back] Misty! Misty!
"Zac: And then, oh, I want to yell…"
Siobhan: [whispering to Emily] It's Rowan.
"Emily: [whispering] Rowan, Rowan. I’m sorry."
"Zac: To Kingston and Pete,"
"Ricky: Maybe you guys should do something together, I don't know. [laughs]"
Lou: That's what I was thinking.
Siobhan: Yeah.
[Emily whooshing]
Ally: Cool.
Emily: The Populi and the Phantasma.
Ally: We're on each side of this...
"Brennan: As you suggest that, go ahead and make a, make an Arcana roll, or a Religion roll, either one."
Siobhan: Oh my God. It's a pop-tasma!
Ally: [whistles] 5. 8.
Lou: I think I'm gonna hit 15.
Brennan: Mkay.
"Siobhan: You want to use your Bardic for that? Probably not, right?"
Murph: Your Religion as a bard isn't better than...
"Ally: Oh, I didn't use Bless though."
"Emily: He’s a cleric, he’s a cleric."
Lou: My Religion is low.
Murph: Really?
"Emily: Yeah, it’s only plus 2."
Ally: 11.
Murph: That's crazy.
Emily: I would think you would be proficient in it. Maybe you didn't choose that.
"Lou: I didn't choose that. I chose more like city street Insight, those sorts of things."
Emily: Makes sense.
"Ally: Yeah, I’ll use it. All right, what am I at? 3, 6, 5."
Brennan: So you're 11.
Lou: Adding the Bardic to the Arcana check.
Brennan: 10!
Ally: 10.
Brennan: 21.
Ally: 21.
"Brennan: You see Sofia is currently, you see an image of the symbol of the Order of the Concrete Fist, that yin and yang between dream and the waking world. And you see that she is some figure of divine, celestial importance now. Something Sofia talked to you about the chosen one, but you think with that 21, roll of 21, if you..."
Emily: You could come up here and create it with me!
"Brennan: If you and Kingston were to have magic, your individual magics working on Sofia at the same time, some wild shit might go down."
Siobhan: [whispers] Fuck!
"Brennan: That is, that's the, I'm gonna need..."
Murph: Did you guys relay that?
Lou: Yeah.
"Ally: Yeah, we let everyone, I can Mind Link to everyone."
Murph: Cool.
[wind whistling]
"Lou: Well, I have her Blessed, so I guess it would just be a matter of, if you cast something on her."
"Brennan: So yeah, if Pete did. And this one's going counter-clockwise,"
Murph: I'm gonna make sure she stays up.
Lou: Yeah.
Murph: So I'll do something to try to make her—
"Brennan tries to move the American Dream, and in the process knocks Stephen Sondheim to the ground."
"Brennan: There we go. Oop, sorry Sondheim!"
Lou: Sondheim!
"Brennan: Ooh, his swords are all right!"
"Siobhan: Oh no, my baby."
Lou: Sondheim!
"Brennan: Lot of risers! And then this is going this way, so, whoom."
Siobhan: Fuck!
[whooshing]
"Siobhan: Wait, I'm still on the platform, though. I'm not here."
Brennan: Hm?
Siobhan: I'm on the platform.
Emily: She's standing in the...
"Siobhan: I'm not moving, I'm…"
"Brennan: Oh, that's right."
Siobhan: I'm on the platform.
"Brennan: Yes, you're back over here on the platform, that's right, you're here. And then our boy Sondheim over here. Bada-boom."
"Siobhan: And Santa probably is over there as well, right? 'Cause he's floating in midair."
"Brennan: That is correct. Okay. Buh-buh-bum. That's gonna be, I will need everybody on platform so, that's gonna be Pete, Kingston, Kingston, you're within what, five feet of Willy, so you get advantage, and Kugrash, and Esther to all make rolls."
Emily: Is this a spell?
Zac: What kind of...
"Brennan: No, this is just the spinning, this is just, these are just..."
Murph: Dex saves?
Brennan: These are all Dex saves. Let me know if you roll 17 or lower.
Ally: 20.
Murph: 18.
Lou: Good.
Brennan: Good? Cool. We're gonna roll for Esther. [sucks in a breath] Esther is flung back.
Siobhan: Oh fuck!
"Emily: Get in there, Willy!"
Lou: How flung back?
"Brennan: We're gonna see, she's first of all going to make a Dexterity save. She fails."
[Emily gasps]
Siobhan: Fuck!
"Brennan: We're gonna see… Willy is going to make a check, this is gonna be a Box of Doom roll."
Emily: Oh my God.
Siobhan: Fuck! Ricky!
Ally: She liked you the whole time! [laughs] Oh no!
"Brennan: Willy is going to grab Esther. It's got to hit her AC, which is 15. He gets a plus 8. On a 7 or higher, Willy will grab her."
[suspenseful music]
Siobhan: Can you get ready to Bend Luck?
Ally: I can’t.
Brennan: 2.
There’s a brief moment of stunned silence as the players sit down. Zac has a hangdog expression.
Siobhan: [whispering] Fuck!
"Emily: Can I Mage Hand to her, no I don't have an action!"
"Murph: I can grab her if she's only falling within 30 feet, maybe."
"Ally: You have 2, even with 4 would be 6, right, and she needed 7."
"Brennan: Yeah, Willy was, needed a 7 or higher, so he was 5 away."
"Ally: Even with Bend Luck, it wouldn't, and I'm out of sorcery, I don't have two sorcery points left, I only have one."
"Siobhan: Yeah, and Cutting Words only detracts, you can't add."
Ally: Is she Blessed? No.
Siobhan: No.
Ally: Or is Willy Blessed?
Siobhan: No.
"Brennan: Esther on her, begins to fall. On her next initiative order, she will be destroyed."
Murph: Okay.
Siobhan: Okay.
[Brian sighs]
"Brennan: Vwoom! Willy,"
Willy: Aah!
Brennan: Misses. I'm going to need
[suspenseful music]
Brennan: Ricky and Sofia to make Dexterity saving throws.
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: Against a magical effect.
Emily: Okay. Okay. 21.
Zac: 19.
"Brennan: 19, okay."
Siobhan: [whispers] Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: [whispers] 5, 9, 15, 17. Sofia, you take 12 points of damage."
Emily: Is this halved...
Brennan: This is halved.
Emily: 'Cause Evasion would mean I don't take any.
"Brennan: No, you failed the save."
"Emily: Oh, really?"
"Brennan: So you're taking 12, you take half, yeah."
Ally: 21 failed it?
Brennan: 21 failed it.
"Emily: So how much do I take, 12?"
"Brennan: 12, you take 25, Ricky."
Ally: How are you looking?
Zac: I have 30.
Brennan: Sondheim's looking messed up.
[magical blast]
"Zac: And this was a, not like an attack at someone else, right?"
"Emily: Oh, was this a spell that he did?"
Brennan: This is a Legendary Action that he did.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: But you, I think you will get an attack of opportunity."
"Emily: Okay, so I'm deciding whether or not to use my reaction right now."
Brennan: Okay. That's going to be...
"Emily: Wait, so you said I could use my attack of opportunity."
Brennan: You can if you want. If you want to.
"Emily: Yeah, I do."
"Brennan: Cool. [sighs] Does not hit. Yeah, it doesn't hit. Fuck."
Ally: Bless?
"Emily: I was Blessed, I got it."
"Brennan: Kingston, it is your turn."
"Lou: You can't do all of that and then do that. All right. [sighs] There's much too much going on. First, I'm gonna look at Santa and say, and then point to Esther and say,"
Kingston: Handle that.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Lou: Then I'm going to step on top of the platform, extend my hand up and cast, how far, how much distance is between me and everyone up there? If I'm standing at the highest possible, if I'm standing up here. Or as close as I possibly can be. 60 feet is what I am wondering."
"Brennan: Is what you need, right?"
Lou: Yeah.
Brennan: No.
Lou: No?
Brennan: No.
"Siobhan: Climb up, those steps."
"Lou: Oh, no way. I'm a..."
"Emily: If Esther goes away, isn't that, aren't those steps gonna go away?"
"Lou: I mean, well, I can't save Esther. And I also, I don't know, my Athletics is plus 1."
"Sofia: What else are you gonna do? Or Acrobatics, how's your Acrobatics, also bad?"
Lou: Also plus 1.
Siobhan: Okay.
"Murph: Well, what is the Acrobatics to climb a stair instead of getting all the way up there?"
Ally: Like Esther's stairs.
Lou: What would it take to get to within 60?
"Brennan: I think I've been saying DC20, right?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, so you'd have to get a 19 or 20."
"Lou: Hmm, okay."
"Murph: What are you trying to do, Healing Word?"
"Lou: I have Mass Healing Word, but I have to be within 60 feet."
"Siobhan: I mean, maybe this is the time for some Divine Intervention."
"Lou: I mean, for who, Esther?"
"Murph: Although you got that thing with Pete, right? Should you ready an action?"
"Lou: I'm already Blessing Sofia, so she's already under my kind of magic."
Siobhan: Oh right.
"Lou: You know what? I'm gonna hit, I'm gonna ready a, I'm gonna ready a second level Guiding Bolt to hit the Dream at the same time that Sofia does."
"Brennan: Only because it is a matter of public record at this point, I am going to chime in, just 'cause I don't want everyone to feel like I dicked you guys over and was a bad DM, Esther is next in the initiative order. That's all I'm just gonna..."
"Murph: Not, oh, okay."
Siobhan: Oh.
Zac: Could you get to her and try to grab her?
"Lou: Can I, I mean, can I?"
"Brennan: There's a risk that you would go in after her, but yeah, you absolutely could."
Lou: I have to try.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: And then there's also the extremely small, you know, there's the Divine Intervention, but..."
Lou: Of course.
Brennan: Of course.
Lou: But I can use that if I need to.
Ally: What's Divine Intervention?
"Lou: I ask God to help me, of New York City. What is the, what's the..."
"Brennan: You can make it there in your movement and just go to try to reach her. This is gonna be another Box of Doom roll. You're trying to hit, it's just proficiency plus one of your physical, so strength or dexterity."
Lou: Both 1.
Brennan: Both 1?
Lou: So 5.
Brennan: And her AC is 15.
Murph: 10 or higher.
"Ally: Come on, Kingston!"
"Lou: Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. Yeah, okay."
Ally: Are you Bardic or anything?
Lou: No.
"Zac: Could I give him my lucky point? Just as flavor, it's my last lucky point?"
"Brennan: This is true love, isn't it?"
"[Lou laughs quietly, and runs his hand through his hair]"
"Zac: [big smile] I think it would help, yeah."
Brennan: Let's see what this first roll is before we start talking about lucky points. 10 or higher. 19!
[suspenseful music]
"Ally: Yes, okay, woo!"
[Ally claps]
[Emily sighs]
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
Ally: We're back in business!
"Brennan: Willy goes, sees Esther about to fall,"
Willy: Kingston!
"Brennan: Wah, his brick hand misses. You move, you move with a spryness and agility unbecoming, but you hear the voices behind you going,"
"Voices: [whispers] Come on, Kingston. You gotta look out for us."
"Brennan: Whoom, bam! And grasp her in a double forearm as her feet trail off into space."
Emily: Ooh!
Lou: Oh God.
"Brennan: That is your, that is your movement and I'm gonna say your action as well."
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: You have a bonus action.
"Lou: Oh, duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh. I think that's going to be, I think that's, I think that's going to be, yes, I think that's it. I'm sorry, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool. Esther… Esther pulls herself up. Just again like tears streaming like, [heavy breathing] and you see that, swirling in the tornado, [whistling wind] that little glimmer of gold appears one last time, and a little chuckle. [Alejandro laughing] And a voice say,"
"Alejandro: She'll be good for the Society, my friend. I'm off to see my darling wife."
[sad music]
"Kingston: Goodbye, friend."
"Alejandro: Goodbye, friend."
"Brennan: You pull Esther up, Esther for her action goes,"
Esther: I've fucking had it!
"Brennan: Whoom! And on all five of these squares, she makes some of those force field plates that are like, [thudding] that bin you guys in so that no one can get flung off of that wall."
Ally: Cool.
"Sofia: Good to have you back, Esther!"
"Esther: [pained yelling] Love you, girl! That was a close call!"
"Sofia: Oh my God, I'm here for you!"
"Brennan: I'm going to need Pete to, who has summoned Nod here to roll a 1d4 for me."
Ally: 4.
"Brennan: Every spellcaster, every, so, Kugrash, Pete, Misty..."
Siobhan: Rowan.
"Brennan: And Kingston, so sorry. Kugrash, Pete, Rowan, and Kingston each regain a fourth level spell slot. Ricky regains a second level spell slot. If you have spell slots that you've spent, you regain a first level..."
Zac: I haven't.
"Brennan: Cool, so you don't gain anything. And Nod floats up to this platform, looks at you all and says,"
"Nod: Trust in the power of dreams to deliver you in these dark times. Destroy this angel, I hate his stupid guts, he's a butthead."
Brennan: And that's going...
"Ally: Can I link with, Mind Link with Nod and ask what was going on, what was the bummer?"
"Brennan: Nod looks at you and says,"
[ambient music]
"Nod: To destroy the phylactery would require a knowledge of the outside of this realm. That knowledge evades us while we are trapped in here, and if we leave, we will lose the opportunity to act as the fate of the battle inside of this spell will resolve. Meaning, if we were to leave to find the phylactery on the outside, it would be too late."
Pete: But does anyone within this spell know it?
Nod: There is a way for ones within this spell to know anything.
Pete: How?
Brennan: They look over at Kugrash.
[soft music]
Ally: [gasps] The bagel! [grabs Murph’s arm] Okay! Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: That is Nod. With that, we are going to take a pause, a pause that will sadly have to span episodes. Thank you all very much..."
Ally: You're kidding!
Brennan: Thank you all very much for watching this episode of The Unsleeping City. Looking at you from in between all these little bars.
Ally: I can't go home!
"Emily: Yeah, we stay here 'til we finish this, you coward!"
Brennan: Tune in next week for the thrilling conclusion of The Unsleeping City.
"Siobhan: Fuck you, Brennan."
Brennan: You guys want some more dice? [threateningly lifts a handful]

"Brennan: The American Dream looks hurt, but not nearly on its last legs. [gasps]"
"Robert: [evil laughter] Guess the cat's out of the bag, kid."
Brennan: See Kugrash pull the bagel out of his bag.
Emily: What?
Brennan: I'm actually going to need everybody but Zac to please adjourn to the green room.
Siobhan: What the hell is happening?
Ally: What the fuck?
Lou: Oh man! This is wild!

[RECAP]
"Brennan: Our intrepid heroes have found themselves in Times Square, New Year's Eve. His shape and form appears floating in the air."
American Dream: This place is filthy.
Siobhan: Fucking Protestant work ethic.
"Brennan: Pillars of flame appear, as well as tornadoes full of refuse."
"Lou: Wow, well this is terrifying."
"Brennan: This thing turns just to look at Sofia. Sofia, you are dead. No saves necessary."
Ally: No!
La Gran Gata: [growling voice] You have much scratching yet to do.
[Emily hisses]
Lou: Murderer's Row right here.
"Brennan: Alejandro is hit in the chest, and is gone."
"Nod: If we were to leave to find the phylactery on the outside, it would be too late."
Pete: But does anyone within this spell know it?
Nod: There is a way for ones within this spell to know anything.
Pete: [gasps] The bagel!
[END RECAP]
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: Welcome back, one and all, to the final episode of The Unsleeping City. As you can see, we come back right where we left off, the eye of the hurricane at the ball drop, New Year's Eve. Here, with our intrepid heroes, say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Lou: Fuck you, Brennan!"
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
Siobhan: Fuck you Brennan. Fuck you Brennan.
[Emily laughs]
"Ally: And also, fuck you, Brennan."
"Brennan: Hey, it's fine. [to the camera] I do a lot of work for this game."
Lou: You killed my best friend!
Brennan: It's a story!
"Siobhan: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: He lived to the ripe old age, 90, what... 92?"
Lou: 94.
Brennan: 94.
"Ally: The Juul killed him, he died with popcorn lungs."
Lou: You don't even know his age? [laughs]
Brennan: 94! That's right.
"Emily: He never found his granddaughters, right?"
Siobhan: Seems young to me!
Emily: Did he ever find his granddaughters?
Murph: They're probably around.
Emily: What if they’re bad...
Siobhan: They're just getting high on Pete's stash.
Brennan: Getting high on Pete's stash somewhere.
Emily: He did tell you to stay away from them.
"Brennan: We are going to start the initiative. Some revelations last time, Nod just told you about the nature of breaking the phylactery, Esther was just saved, the American Dream looks hurt, but not nearly on its last legs."
[dramatic music] The beginning of our initiative here.
[whooshing sound]
Siobhan: Oh my God.
"Brennan: The fire is coming for Santa, actually..."
"Emily: Oh, but he's gotta be flame retardant, he's always going down chimneys!"
Siobhan: Yeah!
Emily: Does he have fire resistance?
"Brennan: I mean, that would check out."
Siobhan: Nice!
Murph: The kind of lawyering that…
Siobhan: That’s a lot of lawyer moves.
"Brennan: I'm gonna need a Dexterity, I'm gonna need a Dexterity from Kugrat— Kugrash and his rats."
Murph: Okay. All right. Rats got a 10.
Brennan: Okay.
"Murph: Kugrash got a 10, or no, Kugrash got a 9."
Brennan: Okay.
"Lou: I didn't Bless you? No, I didn't Bless you. I Blessed those three."
Brennan: Kugrash and his rats take 15...
Murph: Fuck!
"Brennan: 25, take 31 points of fire damage."
Murph: I'm out.
Ally: No!
Emily: What?
Siobhan: Kugrash is down.
Murph: Bye!
Emily: Kug? Can I pour one out from so high...
Brennan: And Santa looks injured as well.
Emily: For my Kug.
Zac: So the rats are gone?
Brennan: The rats are gone.
"Zac: I have rats, I guess I forgot."
[Murph laughs]
"Brennan: Down here, were these yours?"
Zac: There were some rats on my head or something.
Murph: The rats can't do anything.
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: The rats are down here.
Murph: Let's fuckin' face it.
Brennan: Let's fuckin' face it!
"Siobhan: I mean, look, it's a free thing to do, you might as well make 'em if you can."
"Murph: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Kugrash, I'm gonna need a death saving throw from you."
Murph: 14.
Brennan: Mkay.
Emily: Okay.
"Ally: It's over 10, right? I forget."
Emily: Over 10.
Murph: Thank you.
[Ally laughs]
"Emily: But if he does some kind of spell, that's..."
"Brennan: Santa is actually gonna leave this area here, he flies up, and he flies over here. He's going to look at Kingston and Pete, who are both still down there. He's gonna make an Insight check. Which, do either of you seem to have plans or intentions of moving anytime soon?"
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: Pete does? You see he lays a finger aside of his nose, and goes..."
[Ally snorts]
Santa: You know it! Let's blow some snow! [whooshing]
"Brennan: And you are picked up in a gust of wintry wind, and you can fly."
"Ally: Yo! [laughter] Okay, that's great! That's great."
Brennan: So you have Fly active on you now.
"Ally: Great, cool."
Siobhan: Dope.
"Emily: But that wasn't you doing drugs, right? You're still sober?"
"Ally: No, no, Santa did a bunch of drugs. And you know what..."
[laughter]
Brennan: Incredible. That's going to be Pete.
"Ally: I pull out a seven day chip. [Emily laughs] Fuck yeah. All right. I fly, beeline up to Sofia Lee."
Brennan: Uh-huh.
Emily: Yeah!
"Ally: And I get as close as I can, how far is that, if I use just my movement?"
"Brennan: Fly, I believe is a-buh-buh-bah. Speed of 60. So let's see, in a straight line going for Sofia..."
"Siobhan: You just have to get within 30 feet of her, right?"
"Ally: Yeah, that's it."
"Brennan: Boom. Boom to Sofie. It's like here, ah! [the plastic measurer he is using flops out of his grip] And 30 feet, we’re gonna call it 30 feet!"
Ally: All right!
"Brennan: You can just make it there. [whooshing] Surrounded by snow and magic, you see that..."
Ally: I Mind Link with Sofia as I'm taking off.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Sofia: Hey.
"Emily: I say,"
Pete: Sofie?
Sofia: Uh-huh.
"Pete: Both the Vox Populi and the Vox Phantasma are bestowing on you our blessing and it's all on you, here you have Haste."
"[Emily laughs, claps]"
Ally: I cast Haste on Sofie.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Ally: Yeah, double movement, 2AC extra action, you now have, yeah."
"Brennan: I think that Ricky has that as well, so you can share that card. Also, [rumbling] you guys see this incredible, again dream color, purple, pink, rose, and then the grimy gold of the waking world, thwoom! Yin and yang appear spectrally in front of Sofia. Whoom, the Order of the Concrete Fist, Monastery of the Midnight Sun... [Emily imitates martial arts breathing] The chosen one."
"Sofia: Chosen by myself, thank you!"
[Ally laughs]
"Brennan: Sofia, I'll trade you for your old chosen one card."
[Emily gasps]
Siobhan: What?
"Brennan: Go ahead and read that out loud, if you'd be so kind."
"Emily: Okay. “You replenish a ki point each time you are dealt damage. If the Vox Phantasma and the Vox Populi have either cast a spell on you in the last round, including having an active concentration, you gain a bonus to AC equal to the amount of ki you have left.” That's another five!"
Ally: Great!
Brennan: Whoom!
[dramatic music]
"Ally: What are you up to, what's your AC?"
Emily: My AC is now 26!
Siobhan: With the plus 2 from Haste?
Emily: Yeah!
Siobhan: Fuck.
Murph: Jeez.
Siobhan: 26 is wild.
Emily: Yeah! Come at me!
Siobhan: Unbreakable!
"Brennan: Incredible. Pete, that's your turn."
"Sofia: Phantasma, Populi, I'm gonna do you proud."
Ally: Can I do just a Wild Arcana check to see...
"Brennan: Oh, give me a Wild Magic roll actually."
Ally: Oh yeah. [sings carnival music] 13.
Brennan: Mkay.
Ally: To see if I can tap into the dream world and have someone convey to me what we need to know to stop this spell.
"Brennan: Yeah, give me an Arcana check."
Ally: Or the rest of the rune. 18 plus 5 is…
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: 23.
Brennan: It's what Nod said.
Ally: [laughs] Interesting.
Brennan: But I appreciate the hustle.
[Ally laughs]
Lou: My man's out of risers!
"Brennan: Nobody else fly! [laughter] Yeah, La Gran Gata is actually all the way up here with, I'm gonna give her some tacky. Everybody's in the fuckin' sky! La Gran Gata's actually here giving Ricky that extra movement. Meow!"
Ally: [laughs] Meow!
Brennan: Smiling right at his fuckin' head. [laughter] Great. Then we're gonna have ourselves a little… Ope!
The American Dream starts to tilt sideways towards the ground. Brennan catches it.
Siobhan: Oh!
Zac: Just 'cause it gives him disadvantage...
"Brennan: They fall so slowly, it's kinda nice, actually."
Ally: Yeah!
Brennan tilts the platform.
"Siobhan: Bye, Santa."
Zac: He’s flying. He's okay.
"Kingston: [singing quietly] Up and down. Turning on a carousel of time. We can’t return, we can only look behind from where we came."
"Sofia: Kingston, are you okay?"
Ally: Kingston dissociates fully.
Kingston: [quietly singing] And go round and...
"Lou: Yeah, Kingston is just quietly singing Joni Mitchell to himself, alone. [laughter] As he stares..."
"Siobhan: Oh my God, of course Kingston loves Joni Mitchell."
"Lou: Of course, dude."
Brennan: Let's lower them a little bit.
"Zac: I'm sorry, what did La Gran Gata do?"
Brennan: Gave you that extra move action per turn.
"Zac: Gotcha. And, I mean, did he just fly up next to me? [laughs]"
Lou: Isn't he a mist around you?
Siobhan: I think he's imbued...
"Zac: Okay, gotcha, gotcha."
Siobhan: Inside of you.
Lou: He's within you.
"Brennan: Cool. There's a lot of you, you're all around. You're all around there. [Ally laughs] We're gonna keep moving on. And then this one actually is gonna go as well. [sound of grinding stone as another platform rotates] Yeah, we did it."
Lou: My man!
Zac: You guys got that wall now.
"Brennan: Yep. And Rowan's over there. Cool. That is, I'm gonna need, actually, Esther and Kingston, you're next to Willy, and you got the wall in between you, you're fine."
Lou: Great.
"Brennan: Kugrash, I'm gonna need, I know you're unconscious, actually, I think you just automatically fail, you move 10 spaces. But you hit the wall. [honks]"
Emily: Oh!
"Murph: Thank you, Esther."
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: I'm gonna need a Dex save for these last rats over there.
Murph: 4.
Rats: [high-pitched] No! [sound of rats squealing] We love you!
Brennan: That's going to be the American Dream. I am going to start rolling some attacks. [suspenseful music] Let's see here.
"Emily: Oh, if he's doing a spell..."
Brennan: He is not doing a spell. He is gonna take a swing at Sondheim.
"Siobhan: Does, you're within five feet of him, right?"
Zac: I'm grappling him.
Emily: Sentinel.
"Brennan: So you're grappling, yep."
"Zac: So, can I hit him?"
"Emily: Oh, Sentinel."
"Brennan: Oh, 'cause he's making an attack on someone within five feet of you?"
"Zac: Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Yes, you can. You can hit him."
Emily: Yeah!
Zac: All right.
"Murph: You can still Smite on this attack too, I think."
Zac: Yeah. 17.
Lou: You're Blessed...
Zac: Oh plus... [sighs] 18.
Ally: Oh!
Brennan: 17 plus 8?
"Zac: No, no, plus 1, 18."
"Brennan: Gotcha. You, whoo, swing, miss. [suspenseful music] You see he turns around, lays out a fist and, whoo, hurls Sondheim into the, whoo, tornado."
Siobhan: Jesus Christ!
"Brennan: You see Stephen Sondheim flies into the tornado, looking out at you and saying,"
"Sondheim: Remember, the show must go on!"
[sound of blasts]
Brennan: And disappears.
Ricky: Noooooooooo!
Rowan: He'll live on in his work!
Sofia: I think he's still alive. I believe in him. He's too powerful.
"Rowan: I believe in you, Sondheim! And Santa I guess, too!"
Brennan: You might not believe in Santa for much longer.
Siobhan: Oh shit.
Murph: He's gonna kill Santa? You're worse than Philadelphia.
Siobhan: The city or the movie?
"Murph: The city, remember, they threw batteries at Santa."
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, that's right. Wow."
Lou: When was that?
"Murph: It's a 90’s reference, y'all. [flashes a peace sign]"
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
Murph: Kugrash is all…
Siobhan: Fucking Eagles.
"Lou: I was born in 2004, that doesn't make any sense to me."
"Brennan: You see that Santa as well is turned around. The American Dream looks at him, hits him in the chest with those same eye beams that he hit Sofia with. And Santa..."
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: Goes, [blast] toys fly out of his bag. And you see he says,"
Santa: Someone must remember Christmas!
[sound of blast]
Rowan: I'll keep Christmas in my heart forever!
Pete: I should have been on the good list! [laughter] I've made a lot of progress!
"Brennan: As you say that, the Fly spell disappears and you begin to fall."
[Emily gasps]
Ally: [quietly] I'm sorry!
Siobhan: Did what you needed to do.
"Emily: He was kind of hovering over this, right?"
"Brennan: He was, Pete was, yeah, he was over this one I think."
"Emily: Then I was more, I was back where my girl Em was gonna catch me."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Okay. That's his round.
Siobhan: Man. All of my spells have been so useless in this thing.
"Emily: It's not true, you saved my life."
"Siobhan: That's right, I did save your life."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: You see Sondheim disappears, Santa Claus disappears. [magical blasts] I am going to ask that,"
"[soft, somber music]"
"Brennan: You see, as these two huge magical hits happen, [blasts] Pete begins to fall, shoo. The American Dream, injured but having destroyed many of your allies, looks at you, still with this unmoving, expressionless face, I am going to need all of you guys except for..."
Murph: I'm out already.
Brennan: Kugrash is out. I'm actually going to need everybody but Zac to please adjourn to the green room.
[suspenseful music]
"The players start to get out of their seats and leave, except for Zac."
Siobhan: What the hell is happening?
Ally: What the fuck?
Zac: I feel like I'm in trouble.
[Brennan laughs]
[whooshing]
"Brennan: The storm continues. Ricky. You hear the voice of the dream in your mind. It looks to you, and you see its face flickers for a moment, and you almost see your father's face as it shifts and changes, which, after it left the door, doesn't seem like it should be able to do anymore. You see it looks at you and says,"
[soft music]
"American Dream: You are strong, I recognize the dream in you. If you lay down your axe, and let me enter the world, I can give you everything you've ever wanted."
"Brennan: And you see visions of a living and not in danger Esther, your parents welcoming grandchildren into the world, you see all of the things that could happen with a happy and safe life. All of the riches and comfort that your parents worked so hard, came to this country to get for you would be yours."
American Dream: You don't have to fight your friends. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. I just want to ask if you will lay down your weapon and let me pass. I can make all of these dreams come true.
"Brennan: You see Esther holding a child, you with a whole home gym."
[Zac laughs]
Ricky: You're talking fly machine? Free bench?
"American Dream: Free bench, incline, full rack of weights. A full rack of weights."
[soft music]
[Zac laughs]
"Ricky: But that's just my dream, right? It's not anyone else's dream."
"Brennan: The angel looks at you, uncomprehendingly."
"Ricky: But everyone else should be able to, there should be the potential for everyone to have a dream."
American Dream: Will you submit and lay down your weapon?
Ricky: No.
[whooshing]
"Brennan: Zac, can you send Emily in here?"
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: And don't tell anyone what you heard!
"Zac: Sure, yeah!"
"Zac leaves. Onscreen there is a message reading “the players are down a hallway, away from the dome, still wearing their mics”..."
"Emily: I think we're all going one by one, I guess?"
Lou: Are we going one by one?
Emily: Are we all getting told that we...
"Lou: I'm going to, Oh, man, this is wild."
Emily comes into the dome.
Emily: Okay.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: As you soar through the air, [whooshing] time suspends. The angel's face moves to regard you, coolly."
Emily: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: It flickers for a moment, and you see Dale's face. It looks at you and says,"
"American Dream: All I want is to be real, which is the wish of any dream. I understand that you are trying to stop me. I make you this offer."
[whooshing]
"Brennan: And it shows Dale, standing, alive in New York."
"American Dream: If you would allow me to pass, I can bring him back. You do not have to strike your friends. You do not have to do anything at all to harm anyone you care about. I just ask that you let me pass. And this life that you have wanted,"
"Brennan: [whooshing] And you see pure love, your family, you and Dale in big sweaters looking at deer in the backyard, Dale going,"
"Dale: [gasps] Look, it's a baby one!"
[Emily laughs]
"Sofia: Oh, see, the mistake you made was, [clears throat] sending me to Heaven already, so I literally just got back from fucking him, so no, I'm still gonna kill you."
[whooshing]
"Brennan: Please don't tell any of the other players what just happened here, and if you'd be so kind as to send Murph in."
"Emily laughs a little bit as she leaves. Brennan looks briefly into the camera, taking a drink, and then Murph comes in."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. [whooshing] The tornado spins. You are unconscious, covered in burns, rat fur everywhere. You've used this power of the crown, you just Mind Linked with Pete to learn this crazy thing about the fuckin' bagel. And suddenly you, through the haze of blood in your eyes, look up and see the angel looking directly down at you, and its face flickers for a second, and you see David. The angel looks at you and says,"
"American Dream: All I want is to pass. I wish you no harm. It is every dream's desire to be real, to be whole, to exist. If you let me pass, I can offer you this."
"Brennan: [whooshing] You see an image of what you would look like as a man in your 50s or 60s, healthy, with clothes, sleeping in a bed. You see a healthy David. You see a Wally that is taken care of. They are all wealthy. Wally has a wife, kids. A good life for the family that you abandoned."
[tender music]
American Dream: You do not have to harm your friends. All that you have to do is stand aside. I just wish to exist.
Murph: Am I conscious right now?
Brennan: You're conscious enough to understand the offer being made to you.
"Murph: [considers for a long moment] I say,"
Kugrash: I used to be a lot like you. You're a rat.
[rat chewing]
Brennan: And you see you change its face into a rat's face for a moment.
American Dream: [gasps] I am not a rat. [heavy breathing] I am not a rat.
"Kugrash: I can't have what you're offering me, and that's my fault. But American Dreams change."
Murph: And then I eat the bagel.
"Brennan: [wheezes a laugh in shock] Great, if you could please go send Siobhan in here."
"Murph leaves, Siobhan enters."
Siobhan: I'm here.
[Brennan imitates wind whistling]
"Brennan: The wind whips around, you're on this floating platform. You see the angel turn to look down at you. [whooshing] Its face turns into the face of Ewan, the-morris dancer you followed across the ocean on that tall ship all those ages ago."
"The American Dream: Rowan, I do not wish you or your friends harm. All that I desire is to cross the doorway and to be real. As real as you or anyone else. I understand you wish to stop me. So I would offer you this."
[whoosh]
"Brennan: Every choice you could ever want. Every option, all the magical power in the world. Galas and banquets and shows and parties and great conversation 'til the end of time, 'til the stars blink out of the sky. And a place for you forever. Not having to do the ritual, not fearing that someone might come take your gifts away from you. The dream looks at you and says,"
The American Dream: You do not have to betray your friends. All that I ask is you stand aside and let me enter.
"Rowan: My love. For you are my love. My one true love. You don't need to enter, you're already there. And you don't need to be real because you already are real."
"Brennan: Go ahead actually and roll, grab 2d10 out of your box and roll them please."
"Siobhan: A 5 and an 8, 13. Lucky number 13."
"Brennan: 13 original colonies. You say that, and watch the dream fully diminish in size. Your first piece of conversation with the American Dream where you spoke to it, and tried to speak to it as it and say, I know you, you watch a good portion of the fight go out of it, as it cannot help but recognize the truth of what you've said. Please don't tell anyone what this interaction was and go send Lou in here."
Siobhan: Thank you.
Siobhan gets up and leaves.
Lou: [entering] What do you want from me? [laughter] You want me to sit here?
"Brennan: Yep. [whooshing] The storm swirls, the dream looks at you. [whooshing] You see that its face changes. You see people from your neighborhood, you see people you have known, people that have made great sacrifices. For a moment, you see your father, your mother, Liz, Cosmo, you see Alejandro's face appear. It looks at you and goes,"
"American Dream: I do not wish you nor your companions harm. You have barred my entry, and all I have ever wished is to be real. Which is a state of being that you and all of your friends have always had the blessing of. I just wish to be real. I understand you do not wish this. So I would make you this offer."
"Brennan: [whoosh] It shows you a vision of you, in your apartment, with your happy parents, sitting on the stoop with Liz, and a young boy that has her eyes, your features, your arm around him. On his shoulder, he's got a melting fudgesicle in his hand. You hear kids playing in the fire hydrant down the street. He looks up and is talking to you about something funny at school. The dream looks at you and says,"
"American Dream: I can offer you this. It needn't be yours. You do not need to betray your friends, you do not need to strike them, you do not even need to help me. All I ask is that you stand aside and let me pass. And I can make this dream come true."
Kingston: But at what cost?
"American Dream: The cost of you standing to one side and letting me pass. I will make it real for you, Kingston. After all these years."
[tender music]
"Kingston: That's mighty kind of you, American Dream. But you have to understand that I'm 55. I've lived a long life. I've made my peace. And I will stop you."
"Brennan: [whooshing] Lou, thank you so much, you can step out. Ally, you want to step in?"
"Onscreen is a message that says, continuing from the earlier message, “...except for Ally, who, as Vox Phantasma, was able to hear all of the dream’s interactions.”"
"Brennan: So Pete heard all of that. As you are falling through the air, the dream turns to you, you, through your dream sorcery, heard all those interactions. And you see it says,"
American Dream: [whispering] Vox Phantasma.
Pete: Yeah.
American Dream: You are the voice of my realm.
Pete: Yeah.
American Dream: All I ask is to be real. To be who I know I am. You can understand that. All I ask is for your help.
Ally: Can I roll Arcana to see this as it truly is?
Brennan: Sure.
Ally: Nat 20.
Brennan: [quietly] You've gotta be kidding me.
Ally: [points to their die] Nat fuckin' nat 20.
Brennan: Um...
Ally: I want to see its true form.
Brennan: Its true form is not this. [indicates the mini]
Ally: What is it? That's fuck yeah. [points aggressively at their die]
Brennan: It's fucking crazy.
Ally: Huge story rolls! [laughs]
"Brennan: I can't believe that, that's literally the final episode."
Pete: What are you? Show yourself to me.
"Brennan: Let's bring everybody back in here. [Ally laughs] That is, I don't understand how to explain that. [pointing at Ally’s die] I don't understand."
"Ally: Oh! [punching the air] Oh, oh! [laughs]"
"Brennan: I don't understand how to explain that. [Ally laughs] I don't understand, I mean, let me see, let me take a picture, right?"
Ally: Absolutely!
"Onscreen is the photo Brennan took, of Ally’s die on a 20 with their fingers pointing at it."
Brennan: There are forces at work in this game that I don't begin to understand. Is this real? Is magic real? Ally rolled a nat 20 on their Arcana check to see the real form of the American Dream.
"Ally: It was being so nice and I said, can I roll an Arcana to see it as it really is, and he was like, sure give me a roll, and it was a nat 20."
Emily: Specifically your roll.
Ally: I was just saying!
Emily: Ally has the most poetic rolls out of anyone.
"Brennan: All of you, whoom, watch this flickering thing, and see Pete falling, reach out, and the pure power of the realm of dreams flows through you. You connect directly to this thing's heart. [sound of heartbeat] The ephemeral axiom, the ability for a dream to change and remain changing is not a flaw of the realm of dreams. Dreams changing with the minds of their dreamers is the most beautiful aspect of dreams. When you look to see the true form of this, what you see is that a dream this important and this large needs to be able to change. And its true form is every and any form that people want for it. And if it is pushed back through the Golden Door, into the realm where it can have any form that people give to it, that is where it will have its true form. So the answer to your nat 20 is that the only good form for a dream is formless."
Ally: In Nod.
Brennan: In Nod.
Ally: Is it evil? It feels fucking evil.
"Brennan: What you see is that this, again with that nat 20, this image of it is created by Robert pulling it here."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: This form of, and you see it, you can see it has the button up shirt and the slacks, and is like,"
"American Dream: [whispering ominously] I need an SUV, and two and a half children."
[Ally laughs]
"Zac: This is Robert's dream, for sure, specifically."
"Brennan: It seems like Robert's dream, a young, rich, handsome, all-American thing that he has summoned through the Golden Door in New York City to form a realm here for his own. You think that if this moves out of the storm you're all fighting in, this might be Robert's body reforming. And that this dream might fully be under his control."
"Lou: See, did you say that if we get it back to Nod, there's a chance that we'll..."
"Brennan: Yeah, you don't think this thing is evil, it's just, it's a dream, so its mind is whatever people decide its mind is. It is neutral, it is whatever people want to make it. What you do on that 20 is, around the storm you hear,"
"Robert: [gasps] [evil laughter] [gravelly voice] Guess the cat's out of the bag, kid. You have any idea how much money I can make when the thing at the center of everybody's heart is mine? What if we got rid of the middle man, and we made a realm where I was in charge of what people most wanted to be?"
"Brennan: [sound of thunder] With that knowledge, you know that this needs to be put back into the door, you don't know if there's a way, that doesn't, the door's not right here, it's way behind it. But you know that this thing cannot be allowed to pass. You know that it cannot be allowed to remain in this incarnation. There's a possible way of destroying this incarnation that would, if you were able to destroy this corporeal form for it, you would probably be able to seal it back behind the door with that nat 20."
"Ally: Cool. I have a Cone of Cold spell that turns something, if I kill it with the spell, it turns it into a statue."
Lou: I have the Metro Card that can Plane Shift. I don't know if that's of any…
Ally: That’s great.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. That's going to be, so all of that happens. You guys on the platform see Kugrash weakly making those death saves, pull the bagel out of his bag, and that's gonna be Willy's turn. Willy turns to you, Kingston, looking around. All you have, that momentary, all that occurs in a flash, just a moment. What, Willy turns to you with a look of like, what, is there anything you want me to do?"
"Kingston: Aw, I mean, we gotta get Kug, Kug needs to get up."
"Brennan: Cool. You see that he goes, he grabs..."
"Lou: Or can I also, can he move us away from the storm?"
"Brennan: He grabs actually Esther and Kug, five, ten, fifteen, twenty, that's his movement. Yeah, he's actually gonna get all the way over here with Kug, who's prone, and Esther. Cool. Kingston, you're still there. Rowan, that's you."
Siobhan: [sighs] Okay. I would like to see if I can once again climb within 60 feet.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. That's gonna go down to a DC15, 'cause you're part of the way there, already."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: Give me that Acrobatics.
"Siobhan: Okay, I pass."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: 18.
[thudding steps]
Brennan: You scale your way up the rest of the way. You are within 60 feet.
Siobhan: [sighs] Here is what I would like to do. I would like to cast Phantasmal Force.
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: Which is an Intelligence saving throw.
"Brennan: Intelligence saving throw, cool."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: He fails.
"Siobhan: Great. So I can create any sound, image, temperature."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: And while the target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real."
Brennan: Wild.
"[the music swells into something louder, more sweeping and adventurous]"
Siobhan: So I would like to show the American Dream everything that it could possibly be.
[Brennan imitates magical whooshing]
"Brennan: Broadway lights, ba-dah, ba-dah! Have we got the show for you! Bow, whoom! Images of all the various places across the entire country, all of the people that have ever come to New York and moved anywhere else in the country, as the gateway to this land. [whooshing] It looks insane as it's, you see it's twitching, and you've tapped into that ephemeral axiom, and you see its body is morphing and changing as it tries to stop it."
"Siobhan: And I say,"
Rowan: Look at what you could be! Why would you limit yourself when you can be all of this?
"Brennan: Amazing, go ahead and roll damage."
Siobhan: It actually doesn't...
"Brennan: Oh, it doesn't do damage."
"Siobhan: I mean, it's 1d6 psychic damage if it's a real thing."
"Brennan: Oh, gotcha, okay."
"Siobhan: But it doesn't feel like it's, it's not a person doing damage."
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
Siobhan: I just need it to know.
Brennan: Yes. I'm gonna need another Dexterity save from Sofia.
Emily: Okay.
Zac: You have advantage on that.
"Emily: Yeah, I have advantage. Well, I think I also already passed it. The other one was 22."
"Brennan: 22, that's correct."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: 22 hits, or sorry, 22 passes. You can take your attacks as you begin to fall."
"Emily: Oh no, I'm falling back into Em. Remember, Em was positioned to..."
"Brennan: Oh yeah, cool. Yep, yep, yep. So..."
Emily: I'm falling back into Em and then I want her to just throw me back.
Brennan: Rad. Hold on one second. Let's get a little bit of...
Emily: Doing a trust fall. [crosses her arms across her chest]
"Sofia: I trust you, my big statue friend!"
"Brennan: And you want, on her turn, you want her to throw you back?"
Emily: Oh? Her turn is...
Zac: She could just spin you around.
Brennan: She moved and...
"Emily: But couldn't I just fall back into, like, use my movement to fall back into her and then kick..."
"Brennan: Oh, and then actually, yeah, you could jump, you could easily make that jump."
"Siobhan: Oh wait, before she does this, can I also have given Sofia Bardic Inspiration?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
Siobhan: Great.
[sound of shimmering]
"Brennan: Cool, in that case, I'm gonna say that Em actually readied an action, and is gonna go ahead, she heals you for 16 hit points."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: And flings you back up there, and you spring up with the rest of your movement."
"Emily: Okay. I'm, I've got Haste. So first off, I'm going to hex this guy. And the ability I want him to have disadvantage on is Constitution."
Brennan: Okay.
"Emily: So he's hexed, and then I'm just gonna start attacking."
"Brennan: Fuck yeah, go for it."
"Emily: Does a 21 does hit, or 22."
Brennan: 22 hits.
"Emily: Okay, so I'm gonna hit him with my, also one of these is necrotic, one of these is radiant. I'm doing the necrotic damage because of the hex."
"Brennan: He's actually immune to necrotic. But, so go ahead and roll the radiant."
"Emily: So I won't even do that, okay. [dramatic music] There's my d8. Does someone have my d8, no I have my d8. Okay, so that is 15. And I'm gonna Stunning Strike him. That's a Constitution save, which he should have disadvantage on now."
Brennan: Ooh baby! Buh-buh-buh. He passes.
"Emily: Passes, okay. Okay, I'll go after him again. Does a, 18 does not hit. Oh, but I have Bardic Inspiration!"
Ally: Yes!
Emily: And 24 does hit!
Brennan: Yep!
"Emily: Hit him again for [clears throat] another, let's see, 7 plus 5, gonna stun him again."
"Brennan: He's rolling with disadvantage. Boom, boom boom boom! Crack! And in the phantasmagoria around him, a bunch of teeth fly out of his head, and his head goes on a swivel."
Emily: Is he stunned?
Brennan: He is stunned.
Emily: Yes! Does that mean that I get advantage when I attack on him now?
"Brennan: It does mean that, yes."
"Emily: So then my third attack is I got a, 'cause I have Haste."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Emily: That's a nat 1. So nevermind, that's not gonna hit. But I still..."
"Ally: You have advantage, right?"
"Emily: Oh yeah, I have an advantage! That's gonna hit!"
Ally: Yes!
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Emily: And I'm gonna do another 10, and then I'm gonna hit with my very final one, with my little backhand."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Emily: And that's also gonna hit! For another 11 damage.
"Brennan: For another 11 damage, Jesus Christ. [Emily imitates blows] Whoom. He is stunned, he can no longer act on his turn."
"Emily: I want to get in his face and be like, I also still have a fuckin' reaction waiting for you."
"Brennan: At the end of your turn, you're gonna get to use it, because though he is stunned, he is gonna keep using his Legendary Actions, he's gonna miss his next turn. I'm gonna need from you, a Dexterity saving throw."
Emily: Okay. With advantage on that. Is a 25.
"Brennan: 25, you take no damage."
[whooshing]
Ally: Yes!
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: He explodes in fire. Ricky, you do, Ricky, I'm gonna need a Dex save from you as well, actually 'cause you're still up there."
"[soft, electronic, suspenseful music]"
Zac: Advantage on this.
Emily: But this counts as him doing a spell?
Brennan: Yes it does.
"Emily: Okay, then I'm gonna attack him one more time."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: I got a 16.
"Brennan: You got a 16? 21, 25, 30. You take 34 points of damage."
Zac: I'm down. Negative 4.
[Emily gasps]
Emily: I hit him again for another 7. Can I use that...
Zac: Can I use a luck point?
"Brennan: To reroll? You're fine, you have your final luck point, yes you can."
Emily: Yes!
Murph: Rolling for your Dex save?
"Emily: Wait, you have advantage on Dex saves, by the way!"
Zac: I got it.
Brennan: You got it?
Zac: I got 17 plus 5 plus 4.
Brennan: You take half that. Does that still put you under?
Zac: No.
Brennan: Okay.
Zac: I have...
Emily: [relieved] Hoo!
"Zac: I have, so it's 34, I take, what is that."
Ally: 16?
Murph: 17?
Zac: 17?
Emily: You get 7 more damage from him.
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: Yes, I did. Em is going to fly up and heal Ricky. She heals you for 15 hit points."
Zac: Okay.
"Emily: Oh, also he has disadvantage on saving throws to maintain concentration, when I was hitting, each time I hit him."
"Brennan: Let me roll for that then, actually."
"Emily: Yeah, so... Each time I hit him he has it."
"Brennan: Each time you do it? Okay. He would have to roll a 1 to miss. So he, he succeeds, he keeps concentration on the spell. Em flies up and heals. The wind is gonna go. I'm going to need, it flies all the way up to hit you guys up here. I'm gonna need saves from Sofia and Ricky up there."
Emily: Are these Dex?
"Brennan: These are Dex, yep. Or sorry, no no no. These are Strength."
"Emily: Strength, okay."
Siobhan: Sofia get a plus 4 from being close to Ricky?
Zac: Yeah. For sure.
Emily: Oh sweet!
"Zac: I got like, a 31."
Brennan: [laughs] Jesus Christ.
Emily: I got a 24.
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: Oh, I'm sorry, 23."
"Brennan: Cool. Neither of you are knocked out of the sky, which is good news. You do take 8 points of bludgeoning damage each."
"Ally: How are you, Ricky?"
Zac: I'm at 20.
"Ally: Oh, nice."
"Brennan: La Gran Gata leaps from you, Ricky, over to, and actually, you're about to fall."
Zac: I'm still grappling him.
"Brennan: Oh you're still grappling him, that's right! So La Gran Gata jumps over to Sofia, who is about..."
Sofia: Come here!
Brennan: Who is about to fall and [whooshing] sparkles around you.
Zac: When a cat's about to jump.
Brennan: Yeah. [Emily laughs] Does its shoulder thing. [wiggles his shoulders]
Emily: They wiggle their little butt.
Brennan: Leaps to you.
"Emily: By the way, Pete. He has disadvantage on Con saves."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: So La Gran Gata swirls around you. You do still feel yourself falling, but you have an extra move action, which is what the cat's doing. Then that's gonna be Ricky, I'm gonna need a Dex save at the beginning of your turn."
"Zac: The beginning, okay. Advantage on Dex. 23?"
Brennan: 23 passes. You still take half damage. You take 14 points of damage.
Zac: Okay.
[whooshing]
Siobhan: You're still up?
Brennan: It's still your turn.
"Zac: Okay. Commune with my axe. I feel like it's just getting more and more dangerous, so I am going to, I guess I'll swing first, and see if I hit. [suspenseful music] It's a, yeah, that hits. That's my first attack. That's a 19 plus 3. 17, like another 30."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Zac: And then, I'm Hasted so I'll do that last attack. That's another 19 plus three, so all three attacks hit. My first attack, I'll use Divine Smite."
Brennan: Okay.
"Zac: Which, you know, my third level Divine Smite."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Zac: Which would be… How many is that? 3d8 plus 8.
Murph: Should be 4d8.
Zac: 4d8 plus 8?
Brennan: Yep.
Zac: Can I have some d8s?
"Murph: It'll be 5, right?"
"Brennan: 2d8, 3d8, 4d8, and then 5d8 from your axe. So 5d8 plus 8."
Zac: Okay.
"Emily: [seeing the roll, impressed] Ooh hoo!"
"Zac: So that's 10. 16, 19, plus 7, 26 plus 8. That's the Divine Smite."
Ally: 34.
Zac: 34.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: And then I do just regular, that was 38?"
"Brennan: Yes. Again, the American Dream is looking bad. But it's still there."
"Zac: Okay, then I'll just, this is my regular damage, which is just 1d8. So 5 plus 8, so I add that."
Brennan: Okay.
Zac: And then one more. So 7 plus 8. It's 15.
Brennan: 15 does not hit.
Zac: Or 15 damage.
Brennan: 15 damage?
"Zac: All three hits hit, they're all..."
"Brennan: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Cool."
Zac: Then I guess I'm gonna use my ability.
"Brennan: So on the last attack, you're gonna use your ability?"
Zac: Yes.
"Brennan: Right? So that last one did 15, right?"
"Zac: Yes. And I look at Kingston,"
Ricky: You got me if you got me. [laughs]
Kingston mouths the word ‘what?’ back.
Zac: And I need a bunch of d10s from people.
Ally: What?
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: What?
Siobhan: How many?
Kingston: You got me if you got me? Oh God.
Zac: I need… Five.
Emily: You got me if you got me?
Siobhan: You need more?
Ally: Do you need more?
"Zac: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Is that ten? Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. All right."
"Emily: Yeah, get this."
Ally: Get those 10s!
Siobhan: So crunchy.
Ally: Count the 10s.
"Siobhan: Okay, so one..."
"Lou: My kids are doing all right, that's a 7."
Emily: There's a 9 at most.
"Zac: A 20. 25. 30. 39. 48. 48, [snaps] what’s it called?"
Brennan: Radiant damage?
Zac: Radiant damage.
"[emotional, heroic music]"
"Brennan: You see that Ricky takes the questing blade back, you hear the voices of past heroes go,"
"Heroes: You got it, kid. It's the sacrifice."
"Brennan: Go ahead and read that power for everybody, if you'd be so kind."
"Zac: Okay. You can add 10d10 radiant damage to a single attack, but you take the entire attack's worth of damage on yourself, and you need to make a DC15 Con save or die. [laughs]"
Ally: What?
"Brennan: You see Ricky…. Sofia. Bah, bah, bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah! Bah-bah-bah! [punching impact sounds] And Ricky, holding on to the thing's leg, basically while it's being distracted by the light and show, and you're just bodying and knocking teeth out and stunning this guy. Bah, bah-bah-bah- bah-bah! Boom! Ricky leans back and, [whooshing] you see a faint shimmer of wings extend behind Ricky. Hold on one sec."
Brennan attaches angel wings to Ricky’s mini.
Siobhan: Oh my God!
Ally: What?
Siobhan: You angel!
"Brennan: Boom! And you cleave into the chest. [impact sound] Pow! Of the American Dream. This form vanishes. [whooshing] And the corporeal form is utterly destroyed. You see that in its place, just pillar of raw fire, roiling dream energy appears in its place. That is Ricky's turn, I'm gonna need that, I assume you're at zero."
Zac: Yes.
"Brennan: I'm gonna need that Constitution, let's actually get the Box of Doom out real quick."
[suspenseful Box of Doom music]
"Emily: Constitution, add your Bless, my dude!"
Zac: Oh yeah.
Lou: Add that Bless.
"Zac: So constitution's 2 plus 4, so I get 6 added to whatever I roll. Can I roll..."
Ally: And it's a 15?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. So let's go ahead and make that roll. So you're trying to, it's DC15. So what are you, so you need to, what do you add to Con?"
Zac: I have 2 plus my aura gives me 4.
"Brennan: So you're adding 6 to this roll. So you need a 9 or higher, and then the Bless is gonna get added to that as well."
Ally: You got this.
"Zac rolls in the box. His d20 is a 2, and his Bless die is a 3."
[somber piano music begins to play]
Brennan: 5 plus 6 is 11.
Ally: Oh!
"Rowan: Can I, take me instead! I've lived so many lives, don't take his!"
"Ally: Wait, didn't that work, though? 11 because then you add all of your stuff."
"Zac: [quietly] No, no."
"Ally: Oh, total."
Brennan: The 11 was the total.
"Lou: I got him, I got him."
Ally puts their face in their hands and sucks in a breath.
Brennan: That's going to be a spin round now.
[sad music]
Zac: Do you want to take all of 'em? Just pass 'em around. [redistributes the d10s he borrowed]
[wind whistling]
"Brennan: Cool. We can, we'll roll to see which direction you're falling in. You were here, Zac, give me a d8 roll to see which way you're falling. One's gonna be here, and then going clockwise, that'll be the directions."
Zac: Three.
"Brennan: One, two, three. So you're actually falling to the right."
Siobhan: Towards me?
"Brennan: Yes, towards you. But as the spin occurs… So let's go ahead and move this though real quick."
[wind whistling]
Ally: Fuckin' Don Confetti ass bitch. Even just seeing him.
Emily: Who summoned him again? I like that move.
Zac: I called…
"Emily: Did you summon, you fuckin' hated..."
Siobhan: I mean he's gotta know that he is fuckin' in trouble with the rest of Faerie.
Brennan: Sofia's still up here.
Siobhan: I'm gonna fuck up his shit.
Emily: Yeah.
Siobhan: He is no longer a made faerie.
Emily: No he's not.
Brennan: And Ricky indeed is falling in this direction off towards the side. Cool. On Ricky's turn he will fall into the storm.
Emily: How do we get Kingston to Ricky?
Siobhan: I think I can get Ricky to Kingston.
Ally: Oh!
Lou: Kingston. That's gonna be you.
"Lou: Great. Do you, are you just falling?"
Ally: Mm-hmm.
Lou: Do you have a way to stop yourself?
Ally: [shakes their head] Mm-mm.
"Brennan: Great, I'm gonna run, ready an action to catch Pete and then as a bonus action, cast Healing Word on my man..."
Brennan: Kugrash.
"Lou: Kugrash, yes."
"Brennan: Cool, you run..."
Lou: And I'll cast that as a second level spell.
"Brennan: Boom. You run to grab Pete, cast it as a second level spell."
"Lou: It's just two, yeah, 2d4. It's 2, 5 plus, plus 5. 10."
Brennan: 10 hit points are healed to you.
Murph: Sweet.
"Brennan: You jump up. Yeah, Kingston, you're, yeah, you have your readied action to catch Pete. Esther holds on to her force fields that she's doing, and she actually takes a full move action and begins to sprint and create a bridge of platforms, [arcane metal sounds] kind of higgledy-piggledy, that's not 100 percent chance that, you see she's wrecked, but there's not 100 percent chance that Ricky will land on one of them."
Zac: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll that d4.
Ally: For...
Brennan: Nod.
Ally: Oh right. 1.
"Brennan: Everyone regains a first level spell slot. Nod flies over to this platform here, going to where Pete is."
"Pete: Nod, send me back up! [laughs]"
"Brennan: This moves to Kingston, I'm gonna need a Dexterity saving throw, Kingston."
"[quick, tense synth music]"
Lou: Oh no.
Siobhan: Shit.
Lou: Big time failure.
"Brennan: Mkay. 8, 18, 26, 31 points of damage."
"Lou: Fuck, I'm at 2."
"Ally: Okay, okay!"
Siobhan: It's okay.
Lou: Not down!
Emily: Oh my God!
Ally: Aaah! This fucking game!
"Siobhan: Kugrash is back up, Kugrash has heals."
Zac: Dispel Magic?
"Brennan: Kugrash. You awaken and, [chomping] eat the Bagel of All Things."
Lou: The whole thing?
"Brennan: The whole thing. Little thing that happened in Murph's interlude. You have one round, as you feel your consciousness begin to expand. You guys see the crown start to float off of Kugrash's head, and his fur stand on end, and you begin to see images of a rat and an eagle and a bear and a dog and a spider, and a man. You see brief images of an old man with a lot of regrets, and some grit and heart as well. Kugrash, you're beginning to disappear, but you do have the round."
Murph: Can I do anything special or just...
"Brennan: You can, I'll allow you to do it, if you want to take combat actions, you can, and then at the end of the round, we'll resolve eating the Bagel of All Things."
"Murph: Got it, cool. Then I'm going to..."
Ally: You have a Dispel Magic.
"Murph: Yeah, should I do Dispel Magic or should I heal Kingston?"
Emily: Heal Kingston!
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
Murph: Heal Kingston? Cool. I'm gonna heal Kingston.
Brennan: Cool.
"Kugrash: I'll do fifth level Cure Wounds, 'cause this is the last one, bud."
"Kingston: What? I mean, you're glowing and you're turning into a man again. But what?"
"Kugrash: Well, I think I got into some bad trash, I don't think I can come back from this one. Do me a favor."
Kingston: Okay.
Kugrash: My son is a vampire.
Kingston: Oh!
Kugrash: If you could make him not a vampire.
Kingston: I'll do my best.
Kugrash: That would be wonderful.
"Kingston: I think I, hopefully I can do something for that."
"Murph: 11, 15, 22. 32."
Brennan: Whoo! And is the unicorn aura still there or no?
Murph: Unicorn goes down when I go down.
Brennan: Gotcha.
Lou: Can that fifth level Cure Wounds just be a very intense handshake?
Brennan: Yes! A very intense handshake between the two of you.
Kugrash: You're not grossed out?
Kugrash: Not anymore. You're also a human being now. So this feels right.
"Brennan: For the brief moment you are a human being, you shake Kingston's hand. And Kugrash fades and spirals in magical rings and circles, out into the storm. Kugrash, you become aware, first of all, of the things here, as your consciousness begins to expand into the universe, eating the most powerful bagel of all time. As you vanish, you become aware first, with perfect knowledge of all the things which are occurring here, which include Robert's spirit in the storm going,"
"Robert: What the, the fuck, what the fuck is going on?"
Murph: I would like to bite him.
"Robert: Gah! Aah, you fucking rat! You fuckin' rat bastard!"
Kugrash: Fuck you! You're the rat!
Siobhan: You're a human biting another human.
Kugrash: I’m not a rat.
"Brennan: You also become aware, you, because of Pete's clue, you become aware of the edges of the phylactery. You can read the rest of Robert's phylactery. You know the whole incantation."
"Murph: [whispering] Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: And your consciousness expands, you have it in your head, all you need to do is say it, and you also are aware of one other little thing, which is in, I assume either, I assume Pete is carrying it. There's a little list in Pete's bag."
[Siobhan sighs]
Murph: I'm on the naughty list.
"Brennan: And you see that your name vanishes from the naughty list. [scratching] And Bruce Kugrich appears on the nice list. With a little parenthetical, (Kugrash)."
Kugrash: It's too bad Santa's dead!
Emily: But all we see is just Kugrash disappear?
"Murph: I can kind of talk to you guys here, right?"
Brennan: Yeah...
Murph: 'Cause I can tell them?
"Brennan: You guys hear in the storm Robert's voice, and you hear Kugrash going, “fuck you, fuck you!”"
"Sofia: Kug, where are you going?"
"Kugrash: I'm just in, I'm in the mist! I'm in the dream thing kind of. I know how to..."
"Sofia: But you're gonna come back and be around, we're still gonna hang out, right? 'Cause I have a small pool of friends, and you're one of 'em!"
"Kugrash: I need you to hang out with Wally, actually! And I need you to save Ricky so he can be his workout buddy."
"Sofia: Aww, okay! Okay!"
"Brennan: Pete, it's gonna be you."
Ally: How far away am I from the...
Brennan: On your turn you fall the rest of the distance.
Ally: Oh.
Brennan: You're gonna take some but not much falling damage. You take 10 points of falling damage.
Ally: Halved?
"Brennan: Halved, yep."
"Lou: As Pete lands, hopefully close to my arms..."
"Brennan: In your arms, yeah, that's how..."
Lou: In my arms. Can I slip the MTA Metro Card to Nod that they gave me?
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Lou: And say,"
Kingston: Just in case.
[Brennan laughs]
Pete: Great.
"Brennan: You slip the MTA, you have Pete in your hands. Magic swirling around everywhere. And Pete, because you were caught, you're back up on your feet right away. Another spin. [rumbling] I know you guys are all gonna move in a second. This is here. So I need Pete and Kingston to make those saves."
Lou: A nat 20.
Murph: Nice!
Siobhan: Is that nat 20...
"Brennan: You're holding Pete. On a nat 20, you're holding Pete."
"Ally: Fuck yeah, thank you, 'cause I definitely failed."
"Kingston: Hey, you know. I gotta get my foot, I gotta get my balance together, clearly."
"Ally: All I feel is your hand go into my jacket pocket, giving me the Metro Card, but I'm like, hmm. What's up?"
"Brennan: Esther makes her save. You see the American Dream is, Ricky's axe blow has destroyed it. Make another Dexterity saving throw for me. It is now without intelligence, and now is just like, roiling and burning and chaos and just,"
[rumbling]
[sound of roaring flames]
"Ally: Oh, I didn't get to take an action or anything. But was that my action, falling and being caught?"
Brennan: Oh sorry! I fucked up. Let's take your action.
Ally: I was gonna cast Cone of Cold on this fire being.
Brennan: Ooh fuck! What's the range on Cone of Cold?
Ally: 60 foot cone.
Brennan: 60 foot cone? I don't know if you'll be able to reach the flame from there. So you're gonna have to...
"Siobhan: No this cone, I think, right?"
Ally: Oh no. I could try to run...
"Brennan: Oh yeah, you can run!"
"Zac: Could you have done it before you fe-, I'm dead."
"Brennan: Oh sorry, yeah, if you want, do you wanna run and get within range?"
"Ally: Yeah, please."
Brennan: Cool. Buh-buh-buh-buh. You get here. 60.
Ally: [laughs] I'm sorry.
Siobhan: Oh my God.
"Brennan: 60 is, that is unfortunately not within a range of 60."
Ally: If I run and jump onto the platform in front of me?
"Brennan: Yeah actually, if you want to make an Athletics check and Willy is right there, he'll give you advantage on that."
"Ally: Okay. Come on! And I'm Blessed. Eww. 12, 13."
Brennan: Are you remembering that you're now jacked as hell and adding an extra...
"Ally: Oh right! No, no, sorry! Yeah, 12..."
"Emily: Plus 5, right?"
Brennan: Plus 5.
"Ally: Yeah, 17."
"Brennan: Willy hoists into the air your jacked, chrome body rise into the sky..."
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Brennan: You are just within range. You will hit Sofia too.
Ally: I will use a sorcery point to do Careful Spell.
"Brennan: Careful Spell, dope!"
"Emily: Oh, okay. I was going to be like, eh fuck me up."
Ally: My final sorcery point. [laughs]
Brennan: Hell yeah!
"Ally: Okay. It's a Con saving throw, which he now has disadvantage on..."
Emily: 'Cause he's hexed.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: And I need everyone's d8s please, or I just need 8d8."
Emily: If he fails...
"Ally: Oh, then he takes half damage."
"Emily: Oh, okay, cool."
"Ally: Thank you. I need four more. Two, I need two more. Whoa! One more, please. Thank you! Come on, with disadvantage!"
"Emily: Do you, he doesn't..."
"Ally: Oh, you want to see roll before you see..."
"Brennan: Yeah, let's see it."
Murph: Nice!
"Ally: I got a couple of good things, okay. That's 10, 15, 20, 34 plus 8."
Murph: 42?
Ally: 42.
[epic choral music]
"Brennan: 42, [blast] as the Vox Phantasma, you freeze the flame, and there is just a solid chunk of ice. You've arrested the chaos, frozen fire rests in the sky, standing in front of you. You are using all of your powers of the Vox Phantasma, holding it into this single form, getting it to the point where it is weak, and you see the Golden Door behind it glowing. [humming sound] That's gonna be Willy. Willy turns to you, Kingston, and sort of gives you a look like, anything you need me to do?"
"Lou: Okay, I mean, there's the, I mean, you're going to Puppet Ricky somewhere? Is that your hope?"
Siobhan: I have several options.
"Lou: Okay. I mean, if not, there's a crazier plan where Ricky throws me, or Willy throws me into the sky and I attempt to catch."
Ally: You should do that now and just put the frozen thing back through the door. Just make a...
Lou: Can Willy throw me against the ice as to push it through the Golden Door?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely! Cool. He is, I'm gonna make a check for him. I'm gonna say, he has a plus 8 to Strength. I'm gonna say this is a DC25. He's gotta roll 17 or higher."
Emily: So much has been happening!
"Brennan: On a 17 or higher, Willy's gonna get you where you need to go."
Lou: This is insane.
"Brennan: 6, he does not get you where you need to be."
Siobhan: Maybe this is the time to ask the city for help?
"Lou: Yeah. Do you, yeah, I'll use, can I ask for Divine Intervention on that roll?"
"Brennan: Yes, well, so Divine Intervention is a 10 percent chance of happening."
Lou: Yeah.
Brennan: That's a 19 or a 20 on a d20. I will ask you to roll for the chance of Divine Intervention. I've got the Box of Doom going right here.
"Lou: Why not, dude? You only live once. Unless you're Misty Moore."
Brennan: 8.
Ally: Oh!
Brennan: So close to a 20.
Ally: It was so close to a 20!
Lou: It's such a beautiful way.
"Emily: I know, if that was Ally, it would have been a 19."
Lou: Yeah.
Emily: Your rolls are beautiful.
"Ally: Only if it was a story move though, not a combat move."
"Brennan: Willy hurls you up, you land on one of the airborne platforms."
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: Like over here near Rowan. But you are closer in range to this flame.
Lou: Great.
"Brennan: And you have not used your, or your action is the, yeah."
"Lou: Well, it wasn't even my turn. That was Willy throwing me."
"Brennan: Oh right, gotcha, yes, yes, yes. Rowan, it's gonna be you."
"Siobhan: Okay. Oy. Yeah, I'm gonna Puppet Ricky over to Kingston."
"Brennan: Okay. So you do Puppet. Voom. I'm gonna say that's gonna give Ricky an advantage on the roll we're gonna make for, as he's flying this way, that you're gonna bat him this way as hard as you can."
[suspenseful music]
"Siobhan: Wait, before we do that then, I would like to climb up, I would like to climb my movement."
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: Is that okay?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
Siobhan: So I'm within 30 feet of him?
Brennan: Yep.
"Siobhan: So instead of anybody doing any fucking rolls, I would like to use Dimension Door."
Murph: Nice.
Siobhan: Wait! Hang on a second.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: Fuck, sorry. My math is getting confused. So I, can I get within five feet of him, 'cause he's actively falling."
"Brennan: Those are not where the steps are, you could make an Athletics to jump and catch him, but then..."
Siobhan: How about an Acrobatics?
"Brennan: I would allow an Acrobatics, if you fall five or more short of the difficulty, it's gonna be both of you going into the storm."
[dramatic music]
Siobhan: What's the difficulty?
Brennan: We'll call it an even 20.
Ally: What's your Acrobatics?
"Siobhan: [sighs] 11. So I'd have to get, if I get a 4 or below then, and what happens if I do Puppet? I'm so sorry."
Brennan: It's gonna give him advantage on the save he's gonna make not to go into the storm.
Emily: And what's the save he has to make?
"Brennan: Oh, we don't know yet."
Emily: Oh! [laughs]
Siobhan: [sighs] Fuck.
Emily: Oh my God.
Siobhan: Fuck!
"Ally: I mean, 4 or lower on a d20 is okay."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm gonna try then and do the Dimension Door, because I think. God, fuck, if I can't get higher than a 4."
"Ally: I don't want to be the one who said that, sorry! I'll stop talking!"
"Siobhan: Fuck, shit! Fuck, fuck!"
"Brennan: Let's go, this is clearly a Box of Doom roll."
Murph: Clearly.
Emily: Yeah.
Murph: My God.
"Zac: I didn't want, ah!"
Brennan: You need to...
Zac: I would just be... [laughs]
Brennan: You need a five or higher to get our boy.
Siobhan: I need a 9 to get him.
Brennan: You need 9 to get him and not go down yourself.
Siobhan: Yeah.
Zac: What?
Emily: You need a 9?
"Siobhan: I need a 9, a 9 or above to get you and then Dimension Door you to..."
"Emily: Oh, okay."
Brennan: And a 4 or above to...
Siobhan: A 4 or above to not fucking die.
[suspenseful music]
Ally: 13!
Brennan: 13!
"Ally: 13, 13! [claps]"
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: Rowan Berry leaping from platform to platform!
Rowan: I love this young fucking body!
Brennan: You see that Esther throws a platform up under your feet.
Esther: You got him!
"Brennan: Whoom, you spiral in your crazy, beautiful old lady clothes as this hot, young actress. Grab Ricky, the wings on his back, boom. Get your arms around him, and [whooshing] you Dimension Door."
Rowan: Who am I to stand in the way of true love?
"Brennan: I'm gonna say you, I'm gonna put you next to Esther. Or wherever you want to go, where do you want to..."
Siobhan: Does Esther have healing spells?
"Brennan: Oh no, so you go to..."
Siobhan: I'm gonna go to Kingston.
"Brennan: Gotcha, yes, yes, yes."
"Emily: Who am I to stand in the way of true love? But first, let's see Kingston."
"Rowan: Yeah! I mean, look! There, it's not just me in standing in the way of true love, it's also literal death."
"Brennan: Incredible! Sofia, that's you. You are, you can act, but then you're gonna begin to fall."
"Emily: Yeah, but can I fall onto these platform steps?"
"Brennan: You can, you have to make a roll to hit them."
Emily: Yeah. I'm gonna try and do that so that I can push this thing through the door.
"Brennan: Cool, DC20 Acrobatics."
"Emily: DC20 Acrobatics, okay."
Ally: Are you Blessed? I think you're Blessed.
"Emily: Is that, do I get, since I have Haste, and I have..."
Zac: The movement?
Emily: And I have advantage on Dexterity saving throws...
Brennan: This counts as a saving throw.
"Emily: Okay, so I get advantage on this. Well, I got it already."
Brennan: Perfect.
"Emily: Okay, well, the other one was a nat 1, but..."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: The first one was quite high.
"Brennan: Cool. You, boom, fall a couple steps."
"Emily: Okay, and then I want to just rush up and shove this thing through the door."
"Brennan: Cool. Make, we don't need to roll damage, but make some attack rolls for me, make some..."
"Emily: Okay, all right. Okay. [sighs] That's gonna be, [clears throat] 21."
"Brennan: Cool, roll again."
Emily: It's gonna be 24.
Murph: Nice!
"Emily: It's gonna be, let's see. 15."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Emily: It's gonna be 17. 16.
Zac: [laughs] The attacks!
"Emily: How many, do I just keep going?"
Siobhan: How many fucking attacks?
Brennan: I think that just about does it.
Emily: Okay.
[blows and impacts]
"Brennan: Sofia, standing in front of this, [whooshing]"
Voice: It is what it is.
[whooshing]
"Brennan: And another voice, Nod hearing that says,"
"Nod: And what it is, is anything. [rumbling]"
Brennan: You glow with the power of the chosen one. And the frozen flame flies back into the Golden Door. [whooshing] Robert screams.
Robert: [screaming] No!
"Brennan: You hear the storm, [roaring] get worse and worse. Sofia, that's your turn. Em flies up as you begin to fall, catches you, flies you back down to the platform here."
Ally: Why did I get to watch everyone's thing?
Brennan: Because you're the Vox Phantasma.
Ally: Cool.
Brennan: You know what dreams are up to.
Emily: You watched all our things?
Murph: Whoa!
Siobhan: Fuck.
Murph: You watched it from there? That's crazy!
Siobhan: That's cool.
"Ally: Everyone came in and was like, you get to watch. And I was like, okay! And put on headphones and was just like, I almost cried for all of you guys. They were tense."
"Brennan: You guys see, this again, tornado shoots over here. I'm just gonna need Dex saves from Sofia and Rowan."
Siobhan: Nat 20.
"Pete: Yes! Yeah, Rowan! You're so hot!"
"Brennan: You're so hot, you're so fuckin' hot!"
Pete: You're so cool and fun and hot!
Siobhan: My hair is moving in the tornado in that epic fuckin' slow-mo way.
"Pete: We should go see a play sometime, I dunno!"
"Rowan: Carrie Coon is actually performing off Broadway right now, let's do it!"
Pete: I'm so fucking into plays!
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Pete, this comes over here. You see that Willy, give me a saving throw with advantage, 'cause you're right next to Willy."
"Ally: Suck my dick. [sees what they rolled, and laughs nervously] See I, after you kill me."
Lou: You’re also Blessed.
"Zac: You're Blessed, right?"
"Ally: Oh, that adds a 4, so that's nice. It's a what saving throw?"
"Brennan: You're gonna fail, but you take 24 halved to 12 points of damage."
"Ally: Fabulous. I'm up to 20! [laughing] Hmm, okay."
"Brennan: Great. La Gran Gata goes,"
La Gran Gata: Meow! [hissing]
Brennan: Jumps into the middle of this tornado...
"Emily: What, no, no!"
Brennan: And dispels it. Meow!
Emily: Ahh.
"Ally: I love, oh God. Oh, I wasn't hissing this whole battle. That was my plan."
[Emily laughs]
[Ally hisses]
Siobhan: You've still got the vampire teeth?
[Ally hisses]
Brennan: Then that's going to be...
Ally: Meow.
"Brennan: Ricky, you're dead. Full dead."
Lou: Three people have died in the past four hours. Wild.
Brennan: [rotating a platform] This moves over here.
Emily: Four if you count...
Lou: You died.
Emily: I died.
Lou: You died.
Emily: Kug died. Also...
Lou: [to Ally] You died.
Zac: Yester— Earlier.
Lou: You died three hours ago. You guys died a minute ago.
Siobhan: I'm never gonna die.
Murph: You're the only two that never died.
Emily: Kug died.
Lou: And you're dead!
"Siobhan: I mean, I'm not on Santa's list, which means that I’m never gonna die."
"Emily: But also, what’s his face, Alejandro died."
"Brennan: I'm gonna need a dex, as the spinning continues, I'm gonna need Dex saves from Pete… uh, Pete, Rowan, and Misty."
Ally: With advantage since I'm close to...
"Brennan: Yes, with advantage. But Pete, Rowan, Sofia, I'm gonna need dex saves."
Emily: Okay.
Ally: [rolling] Suck my dick!
Emily: Am I near them?
Siobhan: 22.
Brennan: 22?
"Emily: Okay, they don't even need my help."
Murph: That time it worked.
"Ally: [laughs] That time it worked. Yeah, a lot."
"Emily: 22, uh… 28."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: 23.
"Brennan: None of you are knocked back or moved. That's going to be, Pete give me some Wild Magic, by the way."
Ally: Oh right. 18.
"Brennan: 18\. Cool, you're good. Kingston."
Lou: Scramble down. Revivify.
Murph: Oh shit.
"Brennan: You leap down. Hands on Ricky. Ricky, you arrive at the Pearly Gates."
Ricky: Awesome.
"[ethereal, heavenly music]"
"Brennan: JFK, [whooshing] plane's taking off. A huge pair of wings on your back. You see Ox with a pair of wings runs up. [barking] [licking] As you approach the Pearly Gates, you see that a group of angels applauds,"
Angels: Yeah! Ricky Matsui! [sound of applause]
"Ricky: Oh, whatever."
[Brennan laughs]
"Brennan: You arrive there, and after a moment's time, you see a man that you haven't met before walks up to you crying. He's a super jacked, dorky lookin' dude, thick glasses. And he comes up and gives you this big, huge hug. He's got a pair of wings on his back as well."
Zac: I hug him back.
Dale: Incredible. Incredible!
Ricky: Thanks. Something about you seems familiar.
"Dale: Ah, my name's Dale."
Ricky: Oh!
[Emily gasps]
"Dale: You're the, I can't believe it. Thank you for watching out for Sofie, man."
Ricky: Of course. She watches out for me.
Dale: Hell yeah.
Ricky: Yeah.
Dale: This is awesome. This is so cool.
Ricky: Yeah!
"Dale: [loudly, shaking his fists] She's the chosen one!"
Ricky: Yeah!
Dale: [yelling] I love my wife!
Brennan: There's tears streaming down his face.
"Ricky: Did you, just out of curiosity, how did you die?"
Dale: Isabella murdered me.
"Ricky: Oh, okay. I just wanted, I'm sorry that I brought that up."
Dale: It's okay! I didn't get the riddle of the chosen one in time. I didn't understand it.
Ricky: But she got it.
Dale: She got it.
Ricky: Yeah!
"Dale: That's, honestly, the city's better off for it."
"Brennan: You see some tears roll down his face. Kingston, you cast the spell, you close your eyes. You appear at the Pearly Gates. Normally you have to do a little bit of wheeling and dealing when people's souls were especially pure or especially corrupt. But you arrive at the Pearly Gates, you see St. Peter looks over at you, and looks at you and says,"
"St. Peter: [elderly voice] I tell you, Kingston Brown from uptown. How's it going, friend?"
"Kingston: I'm good, how are you, Peter?"
"St. Peter: I'm good, I'm good. Well, what a time, can you believe it?"
"Kingston: I tell you. I mean, it's a tough day. This is a tough day, you're taking a lot of my friends today."
"Brennan: You look and see Alejandro and his wife Esmeralda, [singing] bum-bum- bum, ba-bum-bum, ba-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum…"
Brennan imitates salsa dancing.
Kingston: Okay.
"Brennan: As he looks over and he goes,"
"Alejandro: [deep voice] See what I mean, you have to have a good time!"
"Kingston: All right, I get it!"
"Alejandro: I did a lot of magic, 94 years, a long time for a wizard to be, you know, doing the cryptic riddles and beakers and smoke and saying, a dark time is approaching, and then you say, you know, hey, you keep it secret, and then you say, there is a legend of a rumor of a myth, and you know."
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"Alejandro: But I will miss to go to the corner and get chopped cheese with you, my friend."
"Kingston: Hey, you know. You know, what can I say? I'm pretty old. It probably won't be too long until we're up here."
Alejandro: We'll keep a seat warm!
Kingston: Yeah. Okay.
Alejandro: That way you can come and you can join us!
"Kingston: That's a little morbid, but I started this off. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You keep a seat warm for me."
"Alejandro: Hey. When the time comes, it's going to be a party here, too."
Kingston: Looking forward to it.
"Brennan: You see St. Peter says,"
"St. Peter: So you're here to snatch one of our pure souls away, bring 'em back to that wicked world?"
"Kingston: Yeah, that one Ricky Matsui."
Ricky: You got me. [laughs]
"Brennan: Yeah! You see Ricky's there. St. Peter says,"
"St. Peter: Well, I'll get the paperwork ready, we're always happy to sign a soul back out to you, given XYZ."
"Brennan: You see he starts going, Dale kind of looks off into the middle distance, looks over at you and says,"
"Dale: [sighs] Well, keep Sof, I guess give my love to Sofie. Please tell her that I'm sorry I couldn't be there, and I think the world of her."
Ricky: Okay.
"Brennan: You see that he says,"
"Dale: Ah, Kingston, good to see you again."
"Kingston: How are you, Dale?"
Dale: I'm all right.
"Brennan: You see he turns around, Alejandro says,"
"Alejandro: Dale, come, get some food! Have some fun!"
Ally: Aww! [hugs themself and grins]
Brennan: And you see that Dale starts walking away to go into Heaven.
Kingston: Hey Dale.
Dale: Mm-hmm?
Kingston: Just in case you're wondering. The deer are all right.
[Emily laughs]
"Dale: [sobs] They're just so gentle, they're like big mice! They're like big yard mice!"
Kingston: I know.
Dale: [sobs] Oh! [wipes a tear and sighs]
"Brennan: You see that, yeah, St. Peter gets the book out. He puts the book in front of you. You see there's paperwork to sign and stuff like that."
Lou: I sign away.
[magical twinkling]
"Brennan: And you and Ricky are at the Pearly Gates, and you turn to walk back to the mortal realm."
"Zac: Before I leave, could I stop and talk to Dale for a second?"
Brennan: Sure.
Zac: Can I try to give him my axe? If there's anything I can do?
"Brennan: Yeah. You hand the axe to him. He takes it, and the, you see it, [sound of sparkling] changes to this insane set of nunchucks in his hand. Just like, [swishing nunchucks over his shoulder]."
"Dale: Ah, thanks, man. I appreciate it."
"Brennan: You see that you hand the questing blade over to him. As you do so, you see that he begins to fill with this radiant light, and look around, and at all these other angels, and the angels go,"
"Angles: Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee, you gotta see reason! [fighting grunts]"
Brennan: And just starts housing all these angels. And you see St. Peter looks in the book.
"St. Peter: [yelling] Mr. Matsui, what the hell'd you do! Why'd you give him a questing blade?"
Ricky: I don't know! [shrugs] It seemed like it would be really cool.
"Brennan: You snap awake. Your wings vanish as you are once again the mortal man, Ricky Matsui. You are revivified, boom. You no longer have your questing blade. Kingston, that's your turn. Esther, voom, teleports over here. Immediately starts just gripping you. Just hardcore making out, blood and storm everywhere."
Zac: I'm so dead!
Brennan: You're so nearly dead.
"Ally: You have one life point, but your ass is being rammed."
"Brennan: Nod smiles, raises up. Looks at you and says,"
Nod: I knew I picked right.
"Brennan: Voom, the Golden Door shuts. Boom! The storm continues as the door disappears, and Kugrash, that is your turn. You know the full inscription. All you need to do is say it."
[suspenseful music]
Murph: What is the full inscription?
"Brennan: A branching web of necromantic, horrifying words appear that you boil down, you speak them, you guys hear strangely, him all around the storm. And the final piece are three words in an ancient form of Latin, that just say greed is good. And all you have to do is speak those words and then deny them. So I'll let you tell me what Kugrash says at the end of this."
"Murph: All right. Kugrash says, the beginning part of it. And then says,"
[dramatic music]
"Kugrash: Greed is good, for rat motherfuckers like Robert Moses, [yelling] but not in our town, not in our fuckin' city! Make Wally Santa Claus!"
[rumbling]
Rowan: Greatest city in the world!
"Brennan: The storm, whoom, disappears."
Ally: Ahh!
"Brennan: Happy New Year! [singing] Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And never brought to mind! Should auld acquaintance be forgot, In days of Auld Lang Syne [barfing] And a drunk person vomits all over your guys' shoes."
Sofia: Oh my God.
Drunk Guy: [drunkenly] Fuckin' love this city!
Sofia: Do you have anything else to drink?
Drunk Guy: [drunkenly] I'm from New Jersey!
"Pete: Cool, yeah, checks out."
"Brennan: You see fire vanishes. Willy is standing here, all of you feel Kugrash's essence."
[whooshing]
Ally: He's not here?
Brennan: No. He begins to expand throughout the universe.
Murph: Become one with the juicy cockroach.
[Brennan laughs]
Siobhan: I've somehow found a little stage to stand on.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: And I continue the song,"
"Rowan: [singing] To Auld Lang Syne, my dear, To Auld Lang Syne, I raise a glass of no regrets, For the sake of Auld Lang Syne. [speaking] Goodbye, old friend."
"Emily: I pour one out for Kugrash, and then I get a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich and mash it into the ground."
"Sofia: Wherever you are, Kug, eat! This is for you!"
"Lou: While all this is happening, can I walk up to Don Confetti and just backhand him as hard as I possibly can?"
"Emily: Oh yeah, is he here, the little bitch."
Brennan: He's there.
Siobhan: I would like to cast Dominate Person on fucking Don Confetti.
[Ally claps]
"Brennan: He fails magnificently, you guys kick the shit out of him."
"Rowan: You little shit, you get out of this fucking city and I never want to see your goddamn face again. And if I or any of the fair folk see your face again, let me tell you, there will be trouble."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Don Confetti: Very well. I shall do as many other crime folk have done before me, and move to Arizona, and change my name and burn my fingerprints off."
"Sofia: Just so you know, I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna kick your ass."
"Don Confetti: I don't, then I..."
"Sofia: Once a year, I'm gonna show up and kick your ass."
Ally: Once a year! It'll be like Christmas.
Emily: I roll up on Christmas.
Siobhan: Fucking show up in San Jose. Buy some cowboy boots and kick your ass.
"Don Confetti: I have never made any bones about it, I'm quite bad."
Brennan: You see Don Confetti...
Zac: I grab him and I just wipe the throw up off my shoes with him.
"Emily: [clapping] Yes, Ricky!"
Ricky: It's my cheat day.
Brennan: You all get the fuck out of the hellhole that is Times Square on New Year's.
Ally: Good God.
"Brennan: A bunch of people are talking about, what's this party, free drugs? It sounds dope as hell."
Ally: Boo.
"Rowan: Pete, you can't fall for your own trick. Also, you're sober."
"Pete: No, I, nah, I just want to check it out. I was wondering, I thought it was something else."
"Brennan: The sounds fade. You all can, you know, you see Em heals all of your wounds and injuries. Em kisses you a kiss on the cheeks, Sofia. She looks at you all and says,"
Em: [sigh] Well… Pain is a part of healing. And the things we've lost should hurt. But it does not mean that we are defeated or that they will hurt forever.
"Brennan: And she reaches out and touches your arm, Kingston. Heals you. And you see she gives you a kiss on the cheek and says,"
"Em: I better get back to my fountain. These sacrifices are never made in vain. All these people,"
"Brennan: You hear celebration, confetti, yay! [party revelers]"
"Em: Their lives are our lives, and ours is theirs. All intertwined together. I think that's kinda beautiful."
"Brennan: And she, whew, flies away. You see La Gran Gata looks over at you, Sofie, and goes,"
"La Gran Gata: Well, I have been away from the bodega for long enough."
Sofia: Get back there!
La Gran Gata: There might be rats or cockroaches!
Sofia: Ooh! Save me a Little Debbie snack.
La Gran Gata: I will be sure to find a Ho-Hos or...
"Sofia: Buddy bar, actually."
La Gran Gata: Oh!
Sofia: Yeah!
La Gran Gata: Fun! [whooshing]
"Brennan: And La Gran Gata sneaks away. Willy looks over at you all. You see he looks over at you [Pete] and says,"
"Willy: You know bud, I'm not worried about New York."
"Brennan: You see that he looks over to you [Kingston] and says,"
Willy: I am going to head over to Gramercy.
[thunderous steps]
"Brennan: And he starts taking off. The rest of you are in Times Square. Esther is just holding your hand, Ricky, she goes,"
Esther: What happened to the questing blade?
Ricky: I gave it… I gave it to...
"Esther: Those are incredibly rare and important, they're so important!"
Ricky: Yeah.
Esther: They're so important!
"Ricky: Oh well, I mean, someone else has it that's pretty cool."
[Emily laughs]
Esther: There is a Holiday Inn about three blocks from here.
"Ricky: Sure, yeah!"
"Ally: I stop both of them, like,"
"Pete: Okay, look, you guys need to go somewhere better than a Holiday Inn. You've been waiting so long."
Ricky: You mean like a Howard Johnson or...
Sofia: That penthouse that we talked about!
Pete: Absolutely!
"Sofia: I actually have other stuff I have to do, so I won't be there."
"Pete: Yeah, 'cause you weren't invited. So good thing you're letting us know..."
Sofia: I wanted to make sure that you knew that I was offering it to you for you to stay in and not all of us go there.
"Ricky: I let you know that I gave your husband my questing blade. And I think he, I don't know."
Sofia: He probably really liked it.
Ricky: I think he...
Sofia: He loves fucking shit up.
Ricky: I think he fucked a lot of shit up.
Sofia: Thank you.
"Brennan: You guys see, on the ground before you, a little bronze crown, dirty, grimy little crown on the ground, and a little rusty staff."
Sofia: Aw my God!
Emily: I pick it up! I pick it up.
Ally: Mm.
"Brennan: What do you guys do? You are victorious. You see that the Golden Door is sealed, Nod is restored. You see the shattered time stone at the center of Times Square is being swept up, and a shitty old phylactery with Robert's final inscription completely undone by Kugrash's sacrifice."
"Kingston: I gotta be at work tomorrow at 10 AM, so I'm gonna go home."
Rowan: Kingston?
Kingston: What?
Rowan: Go see Liz.
"Kingston: Okay, fine! Maybe, I don't know! Anyway, we'll be..."
Siobhan: I cast Dominate Kingston and make him fucking go and fix his marriage!
"Ricky: She's at your work, right?"
Sofia: Yeah!
Kingston: Yes.
Ricky: That works out.
"Kingston: I, okay, all right."
"Rowan: Go wish her, go give her a New Year's kiss."
"Kingston: Okay, we just, it was one good conversation. It's a lot, there's a lot of work, you know what?"
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Kingston: Great job, everybody. It was real good."
Sofia: Yeah. I'm gonna go find Wally.
"Pete: I'm gonna go with you,"
"Ally: I think I remember the video that fuckin' Bob Moses showed me where everyone hated me, and Kugrash was the only one that was like, hey, maybe now, or led the charge on like, Pete's fine, and I think I feel like really sorrowful."
"Sofia: Truthfully, I was planning on dying in that fight to be with Dale, but now that Kug is gone, I feel like Wally needs a buddy. And I'm gonna train Wally to be a monk and install him as the new Santa Claus."
"Murph laughs wheezingly and rocks back and forth in his chair, jaw dropped."
Ally: That's awesome.
Brennan: You also do see by the way that Santa's bag and hat are both...
Sofia: I pick those up too because...
"Rowan: Well, but Santa, there's multiple Santas, though, right? That was the premise of the first fight..."
Pete: There are multiple Clauses.
"Sofia: Clones only, but..."
Rowan: There's only one true Santa Claus?
Brennan: He makes clones and there's only one true Santa Claus.
Murph: Wally's so pure hearted. He would be such a good Santa.
Emily: He would be great!
"Siobhan: In this universe, is there a... Santa Clause?"
Brennan: Everyone give me an Arcana check.
Siobhan: Great.
Emily: 13.
Lou: 19.
"Siobhan: 17\. Oh no, 19."
"Brennan: 19? The original St. Nicholas, of course died a long, long time ago. He was killed by the Catholic Church during the dark ages as a heretic."
Zac: Uh-huh.
Brennan: Of course. [laughs]
Ally: Naturally.
"Brennan: Oh wait, that doesn't make any sense, he's Saint Nicholas. Well, when they found out that he had a workshop full of elves, they were like, that's no go, you can't do that. And then they later canonized him, and it's a whole long and involved process."
"Siobhan: Complicated, complicated."
"Brennan: But yes, there have been many, many Santa Clauses."
Ally: Great.
Sofia: I think that this Santa Claus happened to be a very powerful sort of wizard or sorcerer or something. I think Wally's gonna need some muscle around him to keep him safe. But I think he has the heart to be Santa Claus.
Pete: Yeah. Can we stop by a Redbox on the way and get every Will Ferrell movie ever made and show up at Wally's house?
"Sofia: And be like, you got a new job, let's watch some movies! We’ll show you how to do it!"
"Pete: Let's watch all the movies, man!"
Rowan: Except for Bad Santa. Don't show him that one.
"Brennan: And I talk to Esther and like,"
Ricky: Let's just make sure that his other son's not a vampire anymore.
Pete: Oh!
Sofia: That I have nothing to do...
"Zac: I have Remove Curse, I can try it."
"Brennan: Cool, I think you guys probably all head to Forest Hills in that case. 'Cause Wally's there as well. You guys, you see walking down the street, going towards their house, a sort of very sick looking David, his wife, Diane, their two kids, Matt and Delia, and Wally going,"
"Wally: I think the pancakes are better than IHOP, personally, you ask me, it's the best..."
Sofia: Wally...
"Wally: Of premium chain restaurants, I like, I think the pancakes are great. The waffles aren't bad either!"
"Sofia: Hey Wally, hi! Sofia Lee, I'm a good friend of your dad's."
"Wally: Oh! Oh, you're not, okay!"
Ricky: Not her dog. Not the dog. Your dad.
Wally: Which dog? Dad?
Sofia: Your rat dad.
Pete: You guys should hang out!
"Ricky: This is, yeah, you're my best friend."
Wally: You're my best friend! What is it?
"Sofia: Oh my God, we don't want to have to do this. Your dad..."
Pete: Graduated.
Sofia: Graduated to a different plane...
"Wally: Yeah, go college!"
"Sofia: Yeah, so he's gonna be gone for a while, but we have a new thing to work on you with. Do you want a job? A new job? You get to do, I know you like being a, I know you like driving the trains, what about driving a sleigh?"
"Wally: Whoa, on rails it would break!"
"Sofia: No, through the sky!"
Wally: Okay!
Pete: With the reindeer.
Sofia: Yeah.
"Pete: Try this hat on, it's really warm and soft."
Brennan: Full beard sprouts from his face.
Wally: Huh? Oh.
Ricky: You're Santa.
Sofia: You're Santa now.
"Wally: Oh, okay, I'm Santa now. Everyone's gotta sit on my lap for Merry Christmas to tell the presents they want to me."
"Sofia: Yeah, and then one day, you get to go out and give 'em all the presents!"
Pete: Yup.
Wally: Hmm. I need a bag full of toys.
"Rowan: Oh, we got that."
"Sofia: We got a while to work on the whole Santa act, 'cause it's not until next year."
Pete: [laughs] Now you're really high status!
"Wally: Oh yeah, also is there a list somewhere? I feel like I need my list."
"Pete: Okay, look buddy!"
"Sofia: One thing at a time, one thing at a time."
Pete: Here's your list…
Ally: I scramble and hand him some kind of list.
Emily: Did we just create the next villain?
"Pete: Yeah, oh I'm sure, he's really bossy."
"Brennan: He goes,"
Wally: Wow! Okay.
Ally: I Mind Link with him.
Brennan: You see that the hat is downloading tremendous amounts of information into his mind.
"Murph drops his head to the table, laughing."
"Emily: Wait, is it making you smarter? Is it making, can I do an insight check to see if it's making him smarter? Okay. Eh, I got a 6."
Siobhan: I'll do an Insight check.
"Emily: I want to know, because that was Kug's dream to awaken him."
"Brennan: He's becoming wise and smart and you see that he, all this Christmas magic is filling him, but he's still very much Wally. He's, it's not that it's making him smart, it's still very much him. But he has access to a lot of stuff that he didn't have access to before."
"Emily: Yeah, I think that's all Kug wanted for him."
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"Wally: Wow! Christmas isn't a present, it's a feeling! Gah! [facepalms]"
"Ricky: Hey Wally, if you're gonna go to the store and just pick up some essentials, what's one thing that you would include?"
Wally: From the store?
"Ricky: Yeah, like..."
Wally: String cheese.
"Ricky: Okay. Anything else like, if you had to clean up a mess?"
Wally: Paper towel?
Ricky: Okay.
Wally: All right. Whoa!
Pete: What?
Wally: I gotta go to...
"Pete: Wait, no! What?"
"Murph: He forgot them last time, that was David."
"Wally: All right, I tell you what. I better get to the North Pole, 'cause it's almost gonna be Christmas in 11 and a half months."
"Sofia: Yeah! Well, is there a North Pole?"
"Brennan: You see that David, Diane, and Matt and Delia are all looking at this going,"
David: What is happening!
"Rowan: What? Oh, we should probably fix the Umbral Arcana at some point."
Ally: I was just realizing that too.
"Zac: Can I try to remove, do I have any spell slots back, maybe?"
"Ally: Oh, we were healed, right?"
"Brennan: You're all healed, but you haven't done a long rest yet."
Lou: Can I do a Medicine check on David?
Brennan: Yes you can.
"Lou: And just, what is it gonna take to fix him."
"Emily: Can I do, if I get a nat 20, can I have heal him from..."
"Brennan: Yeah, if you get a nat 20."
Emily: Oh.
Lou: A 22.
Brennan: Cool. It'll take a Greater Restoration.
"Lou: Oh, all right. Well, the Holy Detergent will work tomorrow morning, so..."
Brennan: Cool.
"Kingston: Hey, you know how your dad was talking about you, how you got bit?"
David: Yeah.
"Kingston: Yeah, I can handle that. Will you come down to St. Owen's tomorrow morning?"
"David: Sure, I have, I'm freelance, so my insurance is through..."
Kingston: It's all gonna be taken care of.
Sofia: Kug took care of it. Your dad. He's a good man.
"Brennan: You see he looks and says,"
David: You were all the people that were friends with him when he was a rat.
"Kingston: Yeah, that's right. We're his rat friends."
Pete: We're all the adults who were friends with the rat.
Sofia: Yeah.
"Ricky: We were five adults, human beings who were, wanted to be friends with a rat."
Pete: Sometimes we carry the rat so that he could keep up with our stride.
Ricky: I picked him up on many occasions.
Sofia: Sometimes I would do his hair and he would look like an ugly baby.
Lou: They once ran a scheme of chasing people out and getting free drinks at bars.
"Pete: I can almost see him dancing now, really."
Murph does the Kugrash dance.
Pete: I'm just getting a vision of a dancing baby.
"Rowan: David, you need to know that, I know that you had a tough time with your dad and, he really did love you so much. And he really did regret so much that he didn't have a life with you."
"Brennan: [traces tear tracks] Blood, blood."
"Pete: Oh God, are you..."
Rowan: That's very disturbing.
Kingston: It's a vampire spell.
Sofia: Do you want some eyedrops?
Rowan: Also I want you to feel like you can cry 'cause it's important.
Pete: Mm-hmm.
"David: You're just telling me it was, you did tell me it was upsetting that I was doing it."
"Rowan: It's just, you probably, oh you can't see you're actually bleeding whenever you cry."
"David: Oh shit, oh shit."
Ricky: I sent you the Wikipedia page for just what vampires are by the way. Just sort of general knowledge on...
"Brennan: You see Esther shakes her head. You see that David says,"
"David: I'll stop by tomorrow, I'm gonna take my family inside, we've had a long day."
Kingston: I feel that.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"David: And you said, my dad is, where is he?"
Kingston: He's everywhere.
Pete: He's graduated.
"Rowan: So he can, he's here. He's looking out on you. He can see you and he knows what's going on."
"Sofia: He made a huge sacrifice to stop Robert Moses, and in doing so sort of traded his corporeal form for Robert Moses's future."
Ally: Am I able to Mind Link if I can communicate with a willing creature?
Brennan: Yeah. I think so.
Ally: Can I open up a Mind Link for Kugrash to talk to David?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Ally: Imagine I'm repeating everything but you can just talk.
"Brennan: Yeah, you open a Mind Link, and Kugrash, you're wild, you're like, you can remember yourself, but you're also remembering everybody else, you're, I mean, this externalized, infinite consciousness. It's trippy. But there's still a part of you that's you. You hear,"
David: Dad?
"Kugrash: Hey, hey David. I'm in a crazy, I'm becoming one with the world. It's fuckin' nuts."
David: That sounds fuckin' crazy.
Kugrash: It's fuckin' kinda awesome.
"David: Well, shit dad, I guess you're what, you're like fuckin' some bhodisattva, you're like enlightened or something?"
"Kugrash: Yeah, I'm like fuckin' going back and like, reincarnated or fuckin' somethin', man. I'm becoming part of the Earth, becoming part of New York."
"David: Well, shit."
[soft music]
"David: Well, I guess since you're part of New York, then you will be around."
Kugrash: Yeah. Yeah.
"David: Love you, dad."
"Kugrash: Love you, David. Look out for Wally. Although he's Santa now, so… He'll probably be good."
"Brennan: The Mind Link is separated. You see Wally goes,"
"Wally: Wow, well okay, I better, I'm gonna go let the MTA know, I'm gonna give 'em my two weeks, I'm gonna do the next two weeks driving the trains as Santa. And then I'm gonna move to the North Pole."
"Pete: In the first two weeks of January, you're gonna be dressed as Santa driving the MTA?"
"Rowan: Hang on Wally. New York is an at will state. That means that you can quit at any time, you actually don't need to give two weeks' notice."
"Wally: I understand, but the MTA's done right by me, so it's more of a moral than an, but I appreciate your knowledge of New York's complex labor laws."
"Rowan: You know what? As an actor, it's important to know, you know to have your own back, your own manager."
"Wally: Nobody else is gonna stand up for you, you gotta stand up for yourself."
"Rowan: Exactly. That's New York City, baby."
Wally: And to all a good night! [puts his finger aside his nose]
[whooshing]
"Brennan: The wind blasts off. David walks inside, Wally heads back to his apartment as the news..."
Rowan: That train that he's driving for the next two weeks is gonna be the bomb.
"Brennan: You guys tell me what you do. As the battle ends and New York is saved. What happens you guys, I guess go, that's Ricky and Esther go to, I guess, this nicer hotel! [laughs]"
Ricky: Wow. Awesome.
"Brennan: Awesome, what does Sofia do that night?"
"Emily: Hmm, I don't know."
Sofia: Does anyone want to hang out? I'm not really ready to stop hanging out.
Pete: I have to start looking for a place to live and a job.
[Brennan laughs]
"Sofia: Well you know, you could always stay at the Order of the Concrete Fist."
Pete: Really?
Sofia: Yeah!
Pete: Okay.
"Sofia: Yeah, we can pimp you out a nice room, yeah."
"Rowan: Again, it is in Staten Island."
"Sofia: It's, yeah."
"Pete: Oh, is it? It’s also in Staten Island?"
Sofia: Yeah!
Ricky: I think Wally's apartment still exists.
"Pete: Oh, that's so, oh. Actually, I did actually just remember that I did have something else that I had to do. I'm so sorry. [laughs] We can hang out here, though, before you head back."
"Sofia: Yeah, I think I'm not gonna go home tonight."
"Siobhan: I'm gonna go check in with my people, I sort of have realized, I lived kind of adrift for a few hundred years and even, I feel like I need a bit more of a base and then I'm gonna re-establish my..."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: Relationship.
"Brennan: Yes. You go find your people victorious in battle against the vampires, and the faeries moving in from the north, and the Order of the Concrete Fist coming in from the South made short work of these vampires."
Lou: I'm gonna go to the Gramercy Occult Society and use a ritualistic Commune With the City as well as devices there to try and track down Ana and Amelia.
"Sofia: Actually, that would be a great place to party. You want to just go to the Order of the…"
"Pete: Okay, let's though. Let's grab a couple of sixers..."
"Kingston: We don't, we have business. No, we're not going…"
"Sofia: Yeah, we’re gonna come. That sounds fun."
"Brennan: Kingston, you find Ana and Amelia, you Commune With the City. You find them, they've been wounded and bitten, they're unconscious, but stable."
Lou: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: You bring them back to the Order.
Lou: Great.
"Brennan: And then, you know, I assume that night you guys all go to rest, you're with your faerie court. Well, there's a lot of stuff to happen here. But you guys want to do something wild?"
Siobhan: Yeah!
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Let's do something wild. It is a hot, sticky, sweaty, funky, gross New York summer."
Siobhan pretends to shake her shirt out.
"Brennan: It is like mid-August, hot, hot out here."
"[upbeat, jazzy music]"
"Brennan: What is going on in the lives of our dear heroes? I'll tell you what the NPCs closest to you are doing. Sofie, your mom, which no woman in her family in her generation's ever done, divorces your father, and asks if you would like to, for the time being while you get back up on your feet, move in together."
"Emily: I'm actually, I want to say that I offered to Jackson to take over, he made some joke about how he should have retired, and I wanted to offer to take over."
Brennan: Jackson accepts.
"Emily: Okay, so yeah. I bring my mom in, though I want to train her to be a monk and get that divorce body going."
Ally: Divorce body?
"Maria: Sofia, this is, this is better than the Jazzercise, this is nice."
"Sofia: I know. 'Cause it's real, it's functional. You know, you're building functional muscles that you can use."
Emily: And then I also want to have opened a school in the Order of the Concrete Fists for rats in honor of Kugrash. So I want to have a little training center for rats.
Brennan: Beautiful.
Murph: Is this how Master Splinter came to be?
Emily: Yeah! [laughs]
"Brennan: There's a lovely evening, you have your mom staying with you at the Order, you're looking out over Staten Island as the new leader of the Order, the chosen one."
"Emily: I got a picture of Dale, I'm like,"
"Sofia: Dale, I'm coming for you. I thought I was gonna stay with you on New Year's Eve, but I got business here, and I gotta do right by my fallen friends and all. I'll be there when I can."
"Brennan: Ricky, you're firefighting, you're doing your thing. Ana and Amelia now are both vampires. But they're cool with it. There's plenty of stuff that they can do to, you know, keep their thing going, and Esther is the new head of the Gramercy Occult Society."
Zac: I think Ricky quits being a firefighter.
Brennan: Whoa!
Emily: Whoa!
"Zac: And instead has a homeless, starts a homeless outreach program in honor of Kugrash."
Ally: Aww!
Brennan: Oh my God!
"Zac: Just starts running around, giving people food."
Emily: We are like installing all these...
Ally: And now you're triple viral. Like this hot guy running and helping people in need.
Zac: Ox is holding my bag of food.
"Brennan: Yes, you have put down the blade and taken up the mantle of someone who heals and restores and helps people."
"Zac: Yeah. I'm still cut, I'm just still really cut."
"Brennan: You're still extremely cut. You and Esther are very happily dating, six months later. And she also now has coupled the work of the Gramercy Occult Society, and now with the help of the Vox Phantasma, and the Tompkins Square Witches Coven, begin to finally finish the work of mapping all of the magical realms adjacent to New York City."
"Emily: I also want to make sure that, as part of my thing, as being the working with the Concrete Fist is I'm working directly with everyone."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Emily: Like you know, setting up new bridges."
"Brennan: New bridges, not remote, you're involved in shit going on. You're not standing against Dream."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: The relationship between Dream and Nod and the waking world has never been better, for the first time in history, the two Voxes are here at the same time. Six months later, Kingston's still working at the hospital?"
"Lou: Of course. Yeah, I think I'm still working at the hospital. I don't think so much changes for Kingston, I think still working at the hospital. I think Liz and I spent Sundays together."
Ally: Wow!
Lou: It's not like a...
Ally: Full arm distance away!
"Lou: No, it's not..."
Ally: Sundays?
"Lou: Taking it slow, you know? There's a lot of emotions flying around."
Zac: You guys go on walks and stuff.
"Lou: We're two 55 year old people, we've lived long lives. I mean, you don't divorce somebody and then be like, fuck it, we're back, you know? It's a process."
Brennan: Liz comes by with coffee on a Sunday while you're at the hospital and you guys take a lovely walk by the Hudson River and catch up.
"Lou: And I now have a dog, it's just a real mutt named Bruce."
Emily: Aww!
"Siobhan: Three legs, two teeth."
Brennan: Yeah.
Liz: What a sweetheart!
"Brennan: She scratches his chin as you guys walk along together. Very happy, and you give Bruce a very good home. What does Rowan get up to? Six months later, she's probably working..."
"Siobhan: I mean, yeah. She's trying to form a stable government of the fair folk in New York City."
Brennan: Very hard to do.
"Siobhan: Very complicated, a lot of factions. She's also doing some open mics."
Brennan: Wow!
Siobhan: It's like she's starting fresh.
"Brennan: Starting fresh. A lot of people are like,"
"New Yorkers: I can't believe that you're not repped, that's crazy!"
"Rowan: Oh my God, yeah, no, I mean, I just got here."
New Yorkers: Amazing.
"Rowan: Well thank, I don't know, you know? If you, you know, I would love for some commercial representation or, yeah, whatever."
"New Yorkers: I have a friend, let me actually reach out to somebody..."
"Rowan: Yeah, thank you so much!"
"New Yorkers: I'm gonna, I'd love to pass along your information."
Rowan: That's so sweet.
"Siobhan: And then I'm also, once a week I mean, I go and do some workshops with Ricky's, the people that Ricky is helping out."
Brennan: Beautiful.
"Siobhan: Again, in honor of Kugrash and just trying to give people, it's like, I don't know how much skills I have to help these people, but this is something that I feel like I can do is giving people the confidence to..."
"Brennan: Wonderful, a busy life, and Rowan, of all your incarnations feels like the one that has grounded herself the most in the business of the city. And with your fae court here begin to shape this into someplace new. What do you get your silver, I'll let you think about what you get your silver bouillon shaped into."
"Siobhan: Oh, I know what I'd get it shaped into."
Brennan: What do you get?
Siobhan: I would like for it to be shaped into a flag pin.
Brennan and Ally: A flag pin.
Ally: Wow.
"Brennan: A little flag pin! A beautiful, silver flag pin. And you walk in New York."
"Siobhan: And it's an American flag, but with the same colors of the Order of the Concrete Fist, so instead of red, white, and blue, it's the gold and purple."
Emily: Yeah!
"Siobhan: To represent both the magical, but also the American Dream."
"Brennan: Beautiful. [sound of glimmering] Lovely little pin. What's, six months later, what's Pete doing?"
"Ally: Okay, so I think Pete got 53V3N to buy him out of the drug trade, 'cause he absolutely could not do it anymore. But I think 53V3N paid him in cryptocurrency and it was all Etherium. And it was worth a shit ton of money, but it fully tanked, so I think… Pete works a normal job at the bookstore. But I think Pete, when he had a ton of crypto, launched almost a shitty Banksy style secret artist. Just so that he could talk to Priya and hear her go, be so mad that there's this new artist on the scene that nobody knows about. And it's Pete just doing like, what is the most lame thing I could do, and doing it and watching people erupt over it."
"Brennan: Incredible. You work at a dope little, it's like a second hand bookstore. They have a thing where kids can just come and take books from the shelf."
"Ally: Cool, yeah yeah yeah."
"Brennan: You have your, you have some very chill friends there. And as you sort of put up residence there, the money's not great, but you have a dope little portal to dreams here, and it's right around the corner from Kingston's neck of the woods. And any of the kids that are a little bit dreamy and need a portal to somewhere to get away to find something that they've always wished for, can find it in your bookstore. And it's super chill. David comes by the hospital, is healed, and over the next couple months keeps writing letters to Dad, because he knows that they will be seen this time. And takes his family as well as Santa Claus. He takes his family as well as Santa Claus..."
Ally: Santa Wally.
"Brennan: Out to the ball game, and every time he does, he buys an extra seat."
Murph: Oh my God.
"Emily: Can I also say that, as a little thing on the side, I'm like, just making sure that everything's going okay with the Santa thing, like..."
Brennan: Oh yes.
"Emily: I kind of can be like the stand-in Mrs. Claus, make sure everything's running according to plan."
"Brennan: Absolutely,"
"Emily: Okay, cool."
Ally: Your mom becomes Mrs. Claus.
Murph: Oh my God.
"Emily: No, would Wally want to be married..."
Ally: Let's set up your mom and Wally! [laughs]
Siobhan: Oh my God.
"Emily: One time when I'm at the North Pole, I root around to find a Mrs. Claus hat, do I find one?"
"Brennan: Yes, you find a Mrs. Claus hat."
Emily: I put it on my mom's head.
"maria: Well, this is horrifying!"
Zac: Oh!
[whooshing]
Siobhan: Look at those rosy cheeks!
"Brennan: Very rosy cheeks. Incredible. Truly, truly insane."
Siobhan: I'm also making sure that Kingston is having some fun.
Brennan: I think Kingston...
Lou: I now text GIFs to the group.
[cast laughing]
"Lou: But they're all the same, they're all the same one."
Ally: The Dick Van Dyke Show gif.
Lou: They're all a bunch of I Love Lucy and like...
Ally: That one chocolate eating moment on the conveyor belt.
"Brennan: Oh, one question. So Pete is now just a, now you're just doing kind of the job of the Vox Phantasma, what do you do, so Nod is always welcome to have you come, hang out at the diner, come hang out in Dreamland all you want. You're, what do you do with your dad?"
Ally: I think I visit my dad in Nod a lot.
Brennan: Mm-hmm?
"Ally: Yeah, I go to Nod, and I hang out with him and I'm like,"
Pete: That's really cool that you're so open-minded now.
"Mitch: It's hard not to be, everything I've seen has been the strangest thing ever than the thing even right before it, just a moment before it."
"Pete: That's so cool. But also, you know, I mean, you saw these sexual travesties. Are you okay? [laughs]"
Ally: I make sure that he's cool.
"Murph: Even some of the stuff that wasn't sexual, I saw Jesus Christ come in and tell me that he's been lying to everyone and he didn't forgive everybody's sin, and had some, he shot himself."
"Pete: Whoa, that's, okay."
"Ally: I think I'm working with him on how to show your emotions, how to..."
Mitch: Is everything here real? Because if I can imagine it then it's...
"Pete: None of it's real. It's all very real and all very not real, so."
Mitch: Okay.
"Pete: You know what they say about dreams, it's not really what happens, but it's your reaction to it and how you feel, that's what you should pay attention to."
"Mitch: Cool, cool cool. Cool, cool. Do mom and your siblings know that I'm here?"
"Pete: I can tell them, I think. [laughs]"
"Ally: Is there a way for me to get my dad out of Nod, or he's dead?"
"Brennan: No, he's not dead."
"Ally: Oh, I take him back to see them… I'm visiting him for four months, and then that's when I finally ask Nod,"
Pete: Can he just leave?
"Brennan: Nod's like,"
"Nod: Oh, I assumed you wanted him to be here forever."
"Pete: Oh, no!"
Brennan: You bring your dad...
Ally: Awkward!
"Brennan: Your dad appears back in his clothes, but you see he's like, extremely changed, he goes,"
Murph: That was a very jarring way for something to happen that I'm glad happened.
Pete: Yeah. Some powerful medicine.
"Mitch: I'm gonna let my family know I'm not dead, 'cause I've been missing for months."
Pete: Very cool.
"Mitch: You're a good kid, Pete."
Pete: Thanks.
Mitch: I'll be back sometime because I'm never gonna be normal again.
Pete: Mm-hmm.
Mitch: And that's okay.
"Pete: Yeah, totally. I would agree."
"Mitch: Okay. I'm gonna get, I'm going to go, I'm going to get out of here. I'm gonna..."
Pete: I'll go back with you.
"Ally: [laughs] I go, I take a trip up with my dad."
"Brennan: You take a trip back home, your dad, you know, introduces you to everyone as his, Pete's come home for a visit. And we're gonna make it a great fuckin' visit."
Ally: Cool.
Brennan: And your dad ruins a lot of conversation with a lot of crazy shit that he didn't used to know.
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: The other things, the Sardinian Eagle ends up in La Gran Gata's bodega. Added to her treasures."
"Sofia: Oh, don't lick at that."
La Gran Gata is already licking at it.
Sofia: No.
La Gran Gata: [deep voice] Why?
"Sofia: Just, ah..."
La Gran Gata: It tastes very interesting. [slurps]
Sofia: It's been in a man's asshole.
La Gran Gata: [nonchalantly] Okay.
Sofia: Oh wait. Cool. You do you.
"Brennan: And the last scene we'll leave off on, you are giving chinny scratches to La Gran Gata in your beautiful monastery. [purring] A wonderful day of the Order and the Occult Society, Esther and you get coffee all the time. Em is kind of busy these days, but Esther, you get coffee all the time. Esther's now got a key to Gramercy Park, which is pretty wild."
"Emily: Oh, I thought you were going to say to Ricky's apartment. Oh my God."
"Siobhan: She definitely has, I feel like Ricky immediately gives her a key. He already had one made."
"Zac: Just for, you know, just to keep. Just to have."
"Ally: Just to use to come, to come in and out."
"Brennan: You look out, and you look down. You know, the Order, the Occult Society, the Vox Phantasma's got this dope sorcerer's sanctum in this old magic bookshop, and the Vox Populi reigns over and tends to his city. And the new fae court is here, New York's never been more thriving. You look down and see a little group of deer in the little woods of Staten Island move into some backyards. And you suddenly hear, [heavy breathing] and you turn. And a winged Dale, thick black eye, bloody nose, holding a questing blade says,"
"Dale: I saw the deer. They only have a couple minutes, but I wanted to come and watch them with you."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Brennan: He kisses you, puts his ripped arm around your body."
"Sofia: Did you get even, did you get even beefier up there?"
"Dale: I think it's the blade, it's honestly kind of fascinating."
Sofia: I love that you're kicking ass up there.
"Dale: I was, the angels were too much for me. And then Ricky gave me this, and now I can get out kind of whenever I want, and they, they're understanding, they get it."
Sofia: Well...
"Dale: Oh look, look at the little one, look at it!"
"Sofia: I know. That one, he just came along, I think she had 'em maybe three months ago."
"Dale: Oh my God! I also wanted to ask, because we missed this last April, but there's actually a lot of stuff that we can file for with the monastery if you're working with the Occult Society, 'cause the Occult Society can apply for grants, that's actually, so, and they're taxes, we can actually..."
Sofia: Did you beat up a bunch of angels to come give me tax advice?
[Ally laughs]
Dale: I just want everything in your life to be easy.
"Sofia: [sighs] Well, well, you're helping. Tell me the tax advice."
"Dale: Okay, it's a lot of interesting stuff."
Ally: Aww!
"Brennan: And we go away from the monastery, over the city of New York, and a spiral of wind, and Kugrash's spirit watching over his city, and his friends, as a little hairy baby dances on the breeze. And honestly, if that's not New York, I don't know what is. That's been The Unsleeping City. Thank you all so much for tuning in. Take care!"
"[applause, cheering]"
"Ally: If that's not New York City, I don't know what is! A little hary dancing baby!"
Lou: A little hairy baby dancing on the wind.
"Brennan: Only in New York, baby!"
[dramatic music]
[NEXT SEASON ON DIMENSION 20]
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: Thimble Lane was full of tiny little people, who lived in the walls and in the yard and beyond. Fairies and mice and bugs and talking toys. A little world that I'm afraid might be less whimsical than a child would first imagine."
Justin: Who are you talking to?
Brennan: The audience at home?
"Justin: Oh my God, they're filming! Hi, I'm Justin McElroy!"
NPC: What belongs to me is my business. And all the other toys in the house were smart enough to follow suit.
Car-Go: We all have reasons for being here.
Rick: [laughs] Yes! I have a lot of body.
"Bean: If I get sucked into a fan and exploded, you'll know what happens."
Boomer: I have a story in me that's gotta come out.
"Agnes: If I need a compliment, I'll look in the mirror, okay?"
TI: Can I jam the cameras with an electromagnetic force?
Brennan: Can you make up a bunch of bullshit magic in the middle of the heist?
Car-Go: Roll of quarters. That's our in.
TI: Quarters that could go in the vending machine?
"Car-Go: Not just one or two or three, a whole roll of quarters."
Rick: This job is gonna involve explosions.
[roaring flames]
[gasps]
Rick: Flips.
[sound of car bumping]
Bean: Oh hey!
Rick: And maybe space?
NPC: [shouting] Yes!
Rick: You never know!
Brennan: Tiny Heist. A world of big crimes and small people.
[dramatic music]
[devious laughter]
