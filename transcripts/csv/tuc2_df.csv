"Brennan: Hello one and all, and welcome to a brand new season in a mighty familiar setting that you know and love, welcome to season two of The Unsleeping City!"
[cheers and laughter]
"Brennan: Remote style! I am your humble dungeon master Brennan Lee Mulligan, With me as always are our intrepid heroes, say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"All: [so out of sync] Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Going around the table with us today, we have Zac Oyama."
Zac: [in a Lapinesque voice] Hello.
Brennan: Emily Axford.
Emily: [imitating Zac] Hello.
[Siobhan laughing]
Brennan: Lou Wilson.
Lou: [imitating Zac] Hello.
Brennan: Siobhan Thompson.
Siobhan: [imitating Zac] Hello!
Zac: I didn't say it that weird.
Brennan: Brian Murphy.
"Murph: [sporting a buzzcut] Hi, I messed up giving myself a haircut. Please don't dunk on me on the internet. Thank you so much."
"Zac: Ooh, thank god. Thank god for that."
[Siobhan laughing]
"Emily: Wow, broke the format for your vanity. I love my husband."
Brennan: And Ally Beardsley.
Ally: Hello! I too messed up on my hair. [turns their head to show their rat tail]
"Siobhan: No, you did that on purpose. You like that."
"Ally: Yeah, it's true. It's absolutely on purpose. I paid for it."
"Brennan: Well, as you see us here floating over our beloved Unsleeping City, you may wonder, “Hey, what happened to the dimensional dome? Where the heck are these fine people?” Well, I'm glad you're asking that question because it means that the reality of COVID-19 has placed this far in the past, and you're discovering this piece of artifact media from this time period. It's not safe for us to be close to each other."
[Siobhan laughs]
Lou shrugs.
"Brennan: But we weren't gonna let that stop us from coming back to this mystical, magical place. A place of fantasy behind the mundane, set in New York City. But a New York City perhaps a little more magical than could at first be expected. Yes, indeed, this is season two of Dimension 20's urban fantasy adventure extravaganza. And without further ado, we are going to dive back into it."
[2:25 - Kingston’s Intro (1994)]
"We descend on a blazing hot summer's day, over the New York City skyline. The pavement’s so toasty, you could fry an egg on it. And right out of the gate, I am going to throw a curveball at one of our PCs. You know it, you love it because check it out! Over the hot skyline… We notice that we don't… There's a lot of things we do see and don't see. The streets are covered in-- the street signs that we are familiar with, but the style of fashion is a little bit different. We see someone walking down the street with a huge boombox on their shoulder playing music. And indeed, picture if you will, on the bottom of your screen and your mental camera, a little ‘1994’ comes up."
[players laugh]
"Brennan: And around 30 years old, Kingston Brown is walking down the street."
[players laugh]
"Lou: Okay. Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Completely— a Kingston Brown, not concerned with being the Voice of New York, not concerned with magic at all. This is a Kingston Brown who is around 30 years old and is just trying to get where he's going. Lou, could you please go ahead and describe this version of your character for us?"
"Lou: Okay, so 90’s Kingston for sure has a high top. It's like a good… But it's like one of those dope ones. It's kind of like… It's got like a weird, like almost like a Lego shape and it's kind of angled and swooped."
Siobhan: Amazing.
"Lou: Like a thin, gold chain over a very loud, kind of color blocked red, yellow, green shirt. And like a cool, a pair of pastel shorts, and Jordans with high socks."
"Brennan: Incredible. Kingston, you are hustling down the street from a previous appointment. You have, for probably a handful of years now, already been working as a nurse at St. Owens. You're hustling outside right now to go hit up a payphone because you're expecting a call. And you see, as you approach… Normally you have bad luck with payphones. But as you get there, you see this line of people waiting for the payphone out in front. And this is like an important call coming through."
"Kingston: Oh man, come on now. This is why I gotta buy one of those cell phones that everyone's going on about. Ah, goddamn."
"Brennan: You arrive in front of the payphone. As you arrive there, you see the person right in front of you, sort of like suited businessman, looks at his watch, he goes,"
"Businessman: Ah, I don't got time for this."
"Brennan: Splits, just as the woman in front of him looks across the street and goes,"
"Woman: Oh my God, Marcy, there you are. I was about to..."
"Brennan: Runs off, and the person in front of you goes,"
"Person: Oh, great, great, great--"
"Brennan: — Actually on the phone, goes,"
"Person: Good, glad to hear it. Awesome. All right, I'll be there as soon as I can."
Brennan: Click. And a line of three people disappears right in front of you.
"Kingston: Must be my lucky day, okay."
"Brennan: The phone rings in front of you. The call you were expecting comes through. You pick up the phone and you hear the voice of your cousin Janice on the line go… Almost on the verge of joyful tears going,"
"Janice: [gasping] Kingston, I can't… I just got off the phone. I got the job at Cornell, at Cornell Medical!"
"Kingston: [laughing] Yes, yes!"
"Janice: I can't believe it! Kingston, they called me up, they talked about the qualifications, I had the phone interview. I thought I was gonna have to drive all the way to Ithaca to try and get the interview in person. They hired me over the phone! Kingston, what did you do?"
"Kingston: I didn't do anything, Janice. I mean, it's all you, all right? It was entirely you. I mean, you had the qualifications, you did the work, and now you get the results. I am so incredibly proud of you. God, you are going to do great things up there, great things."
"Brennan: You can hear her emotion. You can hear her husband, who she got married to less than six months ago, in the background. You know for a fact that this job is gonna be completely life changing for her."
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: She says,"
"Janice: Kingston, I don't know what I'm ever gonna be able to do to repay this because listen, I know that this job didn't get offered to me first."
Brennan: And you just hear that warm silence on the phone of her knowing who they offered this job to first.
"Kingston: Well, you know... whoever maybe it was supposed to go to, life has other plans for them. So, this is what you deserve, and this is what you need to do. So, you all have a safe trip up there and you call me when you get up there, all right? I'mma come visit or something. I don't know what's in Ithaca, but you know, it'd be nice to find out."
"Brennan: She laughs and says,"
Janice: I'll believe Kingston Brown leaves New York City the day I see it.
"Kingston: Well, I'm looking for a reason to go. So why don't you come give me one?"
"Brennan: She laughs and says,"
"Janice: All right, I'll let you know as soon as we land in. We have a couple of days before the job starts. We're gonna start getting packed and start looking for places out there. I love you so much."
"Lou: I love you, too."
Brennan: The phone hangs up. This was the call you were waiting for. You gave as glowing a recommendation as you could. And obviously Cornell had reached out to you based on your record at St. Owens. What's going through a young Kingston’s mind after that phone call?
"Lou: I think whatever doubt or questioning Kingston might have of whether or not he should have taken that opportunity, I think he just keeps hearing the joy in Janice's voice and is like, this is how it's supposed to be."
"Brennan: Kingston, you head off, you are way downtown taking care of some cert stuff based on the hospital, there was a sort of a course happening down here. So, it's a long walk back to-- so, probably you're the closest place cause you're near City Hall actually. Probably the best thing is the 4, 5 headed back up to Harlem."
Lou: Sounds about right.
"Brennan: You're heading over to Brooklyn Bridge, and you start walking down, a little bit distracted. Go ahead and make a Perception check for me with disadvantage."
Lou: Am I using the stats… using my now stats?
"Brennan: Oh, you don't have advantage on Perception checks yet."
"Lou: Oh, okay. Oh, well, but do you want me to add my bonuses or no bonuses?"
"Brennan: Oh, yes. But you only have a plus 2 proficiency bonus right now."
Lou: Great. Then that is an 8.
"Brennan: So you're a little bit distracted thinking about some stuff you got going on. You've got another shift coming up at the hospital. I think life for this Kingston Brown is busy in a healthy and good way, and the job that is now going to be the foundation of a solid family life for your cousin, who's now moving to Ithaca... That was a big opportunity, and the fact that you are feeling sort of exclusively joy for that, I think there's a little bit of daydreaminess in Kingston."
Lou: Yeah.
Brennan: Which is what makes it really weird when you look up and realize that the lights aren't on in the subway station you are in.
Lou: Are there other people in the subway station?
"Brennan: You look around, it doesn't look like it. I mean, the MTA has always got problems though. So, maybe the lights are just messed up here. But you don't..."
Lou: [speaking faintly] God. All right. Okay. There's nobody? Like it's just dark and I can't...?
Brennan: You could go check out an MTA booth maybe and see.
"Lou: Yeah. I think like after a second or two of like just standing in darkness, I am like,"
"Kingston: Oh, all right, what's going on? [loudly] Excuse me?"
Lou: And I go walk toward the nearest MTA booth.
"Brennan: You are at the MTA booth. You look around and see you're in a subway station that says City Hall Station. Beautiful tile work, arches everywhere, very art deco, beautiful, sort of civic structures in here. The MTA booth is empty when you get down here. And as you approach to kind of look in it and step away, you hear a kerplunk of a token falling through, and one of the turnstiles is accessible. But you didn't put a token in it. You just heard the kachunk. Someone's must've been like lodged in there, but it's a free token into the subway."
"Lou: Oh yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go ahead and take advantage of this fortuitous luck, you know? It's a good day."
"Brennan: You move through the turnstile, and now it's like darker down here cause now, you're past the turnstile into like the station proper. Everything's white tile and white marble down here, so you look around and it's… It's illuminated, even though there's no light sources down here, just because of all the reflective, shiny tile of kind of just the bouncing sunlight coming in from way far away. You get down to the subway platform, you don't see any lights down here, there's no people down here left. You see, across the rails, across the tracks of the subway, there's not another platform. So this is one of those old subway stations that only has the platform on one side and then sort of a wall."
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: But you look down, and across the rails, there is like an opening in the wall that looks like... a burrow or something. But you see that it's caked with stuff. There's like a glittering childs' top, and there's like a gilded like portrait frame. There's a model airplane, and jammed in another place, there's like a puppet, and there's like a golden candelabra. But the walls and ceiling and floor of the tunnel are so jammed with kind of these beautiful objects that you actually can't see dirt in them. And the tunnels are like… Honestly, like about six or maybe six and a half feet tall. It's like an enormous opening across from you. This is now gotten to the point where it's left what you can explain now, it's one of the weirdest things you've seen."
"Lou: And there's still no one around? I am alone in a dark… I think, yeah, Kingston's going to curiously try and see as much as he can without leaving the platform."
"Brennan: You see light down in there, and you hear a bit of… You hear some like music playing from in there, and the light is flickering from the end of the tunnel. And you hear kind of [deep laugh]-- Like a jovial laugh from off in the distance."
Lou: Kingston is gonna kind of slide off the platform.
"Kingston: Hey, if y'all are doing work down here, y'all should put a work order sign cause it just seems like the station is open. But you don't want people coming down here, it's all dark and tripping. Hello?"
"Brennan: You see more light and you could hear more noise. For a moment, you hear some music and some other voices. And I think it occurs to Kingston that there might be some younger kids or some high schoolers who are messing around down here where it's not safe."
Kingston: What are y'all doing now in here? Shouldn't y'all being in school or something? Hey!
"Lou: And I'm gonna… I'll full walk in being like… [bends his head to the side] Because I'm already pretty tall, like precarious of my high top. I kind of, head to the side, kinda walk in,"
"Kingston: Hey, I think there's some kind of work being done here. I don't think we should be down here."
"Brennan: You walk in… As you emerge through this tu-- You go though it for a while, glittering objects, scrolls, things like that. You emerge into a chamber, which is an enormous automat. Like the kind of World War II era wall of glass. Automat is one of those like automated diners. So it's just rows on rows of little slices of pie and cakes and things like that behind little glass doors that have coin-operated slots. Like back during the 40s, you would just like walk into this 24-hour place, put a nickel into a thing, and open a glass door with a slice of pie behind it and like help yourself. Huge automat. There are rows of ruby and golden-crusted revolutionary war era cannons. There is an enormous 14 foot long golden boom box that is playing like old school—- Even at this point, old school, like 70s into 80s, like Grandmaster Flash, hip hop, and it's just booming out. It's kind of fun, just like a fun trip, but it's playing to nobody. The floor is littered with subway tokens that have kind of piled up in the corners everywhere here."
"Lou: Yeah, I think Kingston is just silently trying to make sense of where he is and what this place is. Is there food in the automat?"
"Brennan: Yeah, totally. It's enormous. It's like rows, upon rows, upon rows, tons and tons of stuff."
Lou: Can I look at what's in the automat?
"Brennan: You see that there is a small apple pie that's like a hand-turned pie that is steaming in the automat, like it's fresh baked. And you look and see an old glass bottle of milk next to it."
Emily and Zac look extremely concerned at the thought of old milk.
Zac: Milk?
"Brennan: And oh yeah, the glass bottle is old but the milk looks fresh. And you look and see that there is a metal… There's like a door behind it because people load the automat from the back. So you get a feeling that you could look in the back there and push and see the space through the other side, if you were to open your little glass door and get this pie."
"Kingston: Damn, these teens. I mean, bringing milk into subway stations now?"
Cast laughs.
"Lou: Yeah, can I… I'll push that thing."
Brennan: Do you put a coin into the slot to operate the--?
"Lou: Yeah, I’ll put a… Let me see what these teens are doing with this pie."
[cast cracks up]
Lou: I'll put a coin in there to try and get this pie out.
Zac: 30-year-old Kingston is like present day Kingston.
[players laugh]
Brennan: Let's see here. Hold on one second.
Lou: What do we need to see? Just give me a pie… Just let me eat the pie.
Brennan: Cool! You put it in.
Emily: Don't eat strange pie!
Siobhan: Don't eat pie that you found in the subway.
"Lou: I don’t— hey, this is a good day and now there's just fresh pie and a glass bottle of milk, you know?"
"Emily: Sniff the milk first, please."
"Brennan: You push it in, open the glass door. You have fresh pie, and the milk is like cold. And yeah, you see that there's a metal back that you think you could kind of like slide open."
"Lou: Yeah, I'll take the pie out and then slide the-- slide the metal back."
"Brennan: Looking through the metal, you see a sunny field of grass."
Lou: What?
"Brennan: With a small homestead in it. There is no city skyline, but you do see like other kind of stuff around. Off in the distance, you see some buildings closer. This is not at the right level, you're deep underground."
"Lou: Kingston is gonna like jam as much of his head as he can into the slot, just to make sure that what he's seeing is what he’s seeing."
"Brennan: You jam your head trying to see what you're seeing? It's too small. You can't get your… Your head can get in, but your shoulders can't get through. So, you're looking out. The Dutch woman is wearing… There's like a young Dutch milkmaid wearing a bonnet, like a colonial era bonnet. Comes out, she's hanging laundry on a line, there is a goat nearby. She turns to look at you and like cocks her head to the side."
Kingston: He— hello?
Dutch Milkmaid: Hello.
Brennan: And she speaks a string of Dutch and waves over at you.
"Lou: I full like, rip my head out and slam the automat closed. Is there— What else is going on in this room?"
"Brennan: You hear— There's a large door, there's another one of these treasure burrows that leads out, and you hear through that, another booming laugh going, [deep laugh]. You see a button presses on the boom box behind you with no one touching it. And a new track, some Grandmaster Flash comes on, and you hear a voice booming deeper through that chamber sort of singing along with the music, it sounds like. This booming voice going like,"
Voice: [laughing heartily] Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge!
"Lou: Yeah, I think Kingston is gingerly going to get closer to the source of that sound."
"Brennan: You move through the burrow-- on a mountain of subway tokens, in a huge dome with the celestial heights and clouds on the top of it, gilded columns everywhere, a just suspended subway car is just resting on a-- The dome is large enough that there is just a subway car in here as like an object of interest in this massive dome. The subway car seems to be studded with gems. It has X as the letter on it, which is not a New York City subway line. A massive, serpentine dragon. Pearl white scales mixed with azure blue and emerald green. Long whiskers, both a furry like beard and sort of drooping mustache, but then, also like long, catfish style whiskers. A set of like six horns coming off of a head that is at once draconian, but also kind of canine, but with almost like feline eyes. Multiple limbs, like about eight different limbs. His claws are massive, but compared to the length of this giant, serpentine body, his limbs are kind of scattered few and far between. His head is the size of a taxi cab. And he rears up, looks at you as you come in and goes,"
Dragon: [laughs] Kingston Brown from Uptown!
"Kingston: Yeah. Yeah, yeah yeah, that's-- that's me. Are you the... dragon from that movie?"
Dragon: Huh?
Kingston: The Never Ending Story?
Cast laughs.
Kingston: Are you the dragon from the Never… Is The Never Ending Story real? What's happening right now? Did you trap a Dutch woman down here? What's going on?
Dragon: Did I trap a Dutch woman? Who?
Kingston: Well there’s a Dutch woman in a box!
"Dragon: No, no, no, no. Did you go for the Dutch apple pie?"
Kingston: Yeah.
"Dragon: That’s— No, she's fine. She's in New Amsterdam. You're completely fine. She's not here. She's not in this pla… Well, she in this place, but she's not in this time."
"Kingston: What? What is that… Hey. Uh, don't eat me, please don't eat me."
"Dragon: No, I’m not Falcor."
Kingston: I don’t wanna— What's happening?
"Dragon: Ooh, sorry, let me explain."
"Brennan: The dragon greatly reduces his size to the point now where he's still very long and serpentine, but now, his head and sort of front quarters are more the size of a tiger or some kind of similar animal. He goes,"
"Dragon: Kingston Brown, what an honest pleasure to meet you. An honor, truly. I am the Dragon of Bleecker Street, and you... you have a very special life ahead of you."
"Dragon: He reaches down and from the massive pile of subway tokens, pulls a single, gleaming subway token. He grabs a piece of leather, spins it through the hole in the center of the subway token, extends it to you and says,"
Dragon: This is a gift from me to you.
"Brennan: And puts it over your head. You begin to hear voices speaking to you, voices of people far overhead and all around. It doesn't feel like you're “hearing things”. It feels like you are hearing... things. You're just now hearing the voices of people out in the city. The Dragon smiles at you and says,"
"Dragon: I am aware. I'm sorry that I was sort of having a good time. I've been listening to some of my favorite tracks and have been enjoying some of the automat’s fine foods, and life is for the living, you know?"
Kingston: Yeah. And you got good taste of… What is this? And what am I… What are these… Who is this?
"Dragon: Oh, Oh. Let us have a walk through up my chambers, you and I. I have much to tell you."
"Brennan: And the dragon puts a reassuring claw on your shoulder. And it doesn't… It feels cool and scaly, but reassuring. There is something about the dragon's claw that doesn't alarm you like it otherwise might. And the absurdity of all this-- somehow the coin around your neck anchors you, in a way. And the dragon goes,"
"Dragon: There was much to explain, and you have already paid for your pie. Let us eat, and I will talk to you and tell you what it is you are now seeing."
"Brennan: Over the course of the next hour or so, Kingston walks and talks with this ancient dragon about the nature of the Unsleeping City, and the fact that for many long years, there has not been a Vox Populi within the Unsleeping City, but there greatly needs to be. As the conversation arrives at sort of a natural conclusion, Kingston's questions all get either wholly, or in most cases, only partially answered. The dragon has a massive sort of silver cauldron full of ice cream. You're now back on the subway platform outside the horde. And he's sort of stretching out his full form on the subway platform. What shape is Kingston in after the dragon divulges all of this information?"
"Lou: I think very much overwhelmed, but I think if this token seems to be anchoring me, I mean, I think that, for the most part, a lot of what Kingston's hearing is that there's the ability to do good, and there's the opportunity to do good. And as scary as that may be, there's also something exciting about that."
Brennan: The dragon looks up at you and smiles. Go ahead and make a Medicine check for me.
Lou: Okay. That's gonna be a 25.
"Brennan: As Kingston is sort of meditating on the lifesaver to get out of the total collapse of your mind when faced with the fact that everything you ever knew about the nature of the world is wrong. That Kingston's lifesaver is, “This is a way to help people more than I can now.” The dragon smiles, and you see much like a reptile, some of his scales kind of molt off. And you see the dragon takes like a deep wheezy breath. He goes, [breathing in heavily]"
Kingston: You all right?
Dragon: What?
"Lou: Well, can I push… I don't know where this Dragon's lungs are, but can I push my ear up against its chest?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you see, you go up. You try to find where it's lungs would be in this long, long body, and you put your ear up against it. On a 25, you hear a rasp from within the Dragon's breathing, and you also hear a heartbeat that to you sounds, for a creature of this size, I mean, you're not a veterinarian, but you're like that's a pretty weak heartbeat and the blood pressure is pretty low."
"Kingston: You don't seem to be doing so well. I mean, I don't know. Maybe this is normal for you, but it doesn't sound good."
"Brennan: The Dragon looks up and smiles at you and says,"
"Dragon: I am doing very well, actually. The past few days have been very, very rewarding. Knowing that my time is coming means I have been able to engage in my vices more than normal. Big bowls of ice cream, trips to the automat, filling my time with my favorite memories, the best music, the best art, the best books and plays and music and..."
"Brennan: And you see as the Dragon says that, his scales shimmer, and you see like motes of light and hear ragtime, and jazz, and hip hop, and you see Vaudeville and Broadway shows. You see like street art, spray paint, but then turn of the century, you see like ticker tape parades, all these things throughout the history of New York City. And you see the Dragon looks up at you and says,"
"Dragon: My only fear was I wouldn't make it long enough to find the right one. The right one. And you are the right one, Kingston. [sighs] Frightening times are coming. There will be friends and allies in the Unsleeping City for you, and they need you. That will be your journey, I'm afraid, Kingston. There will always be those who need you. And you will have to decide how much of yourself you can give because it's always nice to keep a little slice of pie for yourself."
Brennan: Eats little piece of pie.
"Kingston: This is my city, this is my community. And for everything that it's given me, I'm ready to give it right back, I think. I mean, I really don't understand. So there's just… There are goblins just out there, just in New York City?"
Dragon: Extremely.
"Kingston: I know I've asked this before, but just 100% [they begin to talk over each other] And there's another police department?"
"Dragon: [interrupting] Kingston, I'm so sorry. But actually, I'm sorry, looks like your train might be--"
"Brennan: The dragon vanishes as a train speeds by. Kingston, you're standing on the platform of the Brooklyn Bridge 4, 5 station. And the 4 train pulls into the station. And you watch scintillating motes of dry, shed scales filled with memories fade off. You've still got the coin around your neck."
Kingston: I am not gonna get used to this. I'm not gonna get used to this at all.
"Brennan: And you wake up three years after the events of the Unsleeping City season one, in your apartment in Harlem, hell yes. And we're gonna cut over, roll a little die here. Okay. It is the morning of October 30th, three years after the events of season one. It's a beautiful fall in New York. Oh, baby, fall in New York is so wonderful. The air is crisp..."
"Emily: So, Halloween is tomorrow?"
"Brennan: Halloween is tomorrow. The group chat thread of the champions of New York has pr… Even those of you who have retreated a little bit from magical life, know that Halloween is tomorrow and Halloween is always a shit show, and some magical business happens. We descend on this crisp, bright fall morning, sun shining, New Yorkers walking around in light sweaters and jackets. The perfect time to be in the city."
[36:06 - Ricky’s Intro]
"We move across the East river from Harlem, all the way down to beautiful brownstones and Ivy and trees to the wonderful Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. And we see out on the corner, there is a tall building of apartments. And on top of it, a miniature clock tower. And we approached the glass face of the clock tower, which is frosted white glass, so it's not completely transparent, but light comes through. And we move through that clock tower to see a gorgeous apartment. There are plants everywhere around, away from the clock tower face, behind the clock tower. There are windows on the other side with rows and rows of plants suspended. And we see a massive kind of open, complex, open plan apartment with two figures lying in a giant bed together, one of whom should be described by Mr. Zac Oyama. Zac, can you describe your character?"
"Zac: Yeah. Hey, what's going on? I'm Ricky, as you all know. Ricky, just as strong as ever, absolutely ripped still. Fully asleep, has no… Just the type of person who just lays down in bed and fully falls asleep for maybe as long as he needs or longer. No, nothing in his brain will slow him down in that way. Ricky is just fully passed out asleep, maybe smiling in his sleep."
Emily: [laughs] What does Ricky dream of?
[Brennan laughs]
"Emily: His life is a dream, what does he dream of?"
Zac: It's the exact same picture of…
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: And by the way, I was actually mistaken. There are two figures in the bed, and a third on the bed because Ox the dalmatian is curled up the foot of the bed. Ricky, you're fast asleep. Next to you sleeping, oh, so peacefully as well is the current head and Chairwoman of the Gramercy Occult Society, Esther Sinclair. Esther has fully barnacled, like fetal position, around you in her sleep. You see her constant internal wizard work has her brows… She's almost always in like rapid eye movement as she sleeps, thinking or something. But..."
Zac: Whatever the opposite of a furrowed brow is what Ricky has.
"Ally: A loose brow, a sprawling brow."
"Brennan: You see that Esther has her hair wrapped in silk with like star and moon, like wizard patterns around it. And is like sleeping next to you, breathing very slowly, but still working on something in her mind. And whatever it is, as you slowly wake up, you see whatever she's working on her mind, she solves it. And her brow and unfurrows and she smiles, and just softly snores a little bit. Around you are like huge, beautiful, deep, dark, reclaimed wood shelves that kind of are structured on like that very chic like exposed pipe. You know, it's that sort of like pipe, and exposed wood, and exposed brick. Huge collections of tomes are here, her personal arcane library. On her bedside table. You see there's like glass of water, humidifier, glasses and contacts, and a bunch of other… And her silver baseball bat arcane focus, leaning up against the bedside table. And this place is like plants, lovely furniture, big old TV, magic books, floating, hovering, arcane thing, huge workout area over in a corner, with a ton of weights everywhere. And you wake up as Ox gets up first, licks your face for another beautiful morning."
"Zac: Yeah, Ricky's eyes just immediately open. He licks Ox back— no. Pats Ox on the head. And then is like,"
"Ricky: All right, it's time to rise and grind."
"Zac: Ricky goes… He has this like morning routine where he gets his coffee going. And as soon as he starts the coffee timer, he just goes and does pull ups until it's done. Then he just carries around his morning. I think he probably gets a shake going as well."
Brennan: Hell yeah. The shake going is Esther's alarm. She wakes up as the shake goes.
"Esther: [yawning] Oh, wonderful, wonderful. Another perfect day. Good morning, sweetie."
"Brennan: And she floats out of bed, levitates over somewhere."
Zac: Trying to hand her a coffee like in the sky.
"Esther: Thank you, my darling."
Brennan: Takes it.
"Esther: Mm, perfect."
Ricky: Thank you.
"Brennan: And scoots over to a very sunlit window, surrounded by plants, other things like that. Your guys' morning routine is very synchronized. She comes over, alights on a chair, a big armchair, and takes a bunch of sort of like arcane stuff, puts it to the side, takes coffee, takes a little snack of some kind of like cashews and Brazil nuts just something to get her body started. And it's like,"
Esther: Okay.
"Zac: As she’s snacking, I start trying to like sketch her with charcoal and my big… My new hobby is art, just the idea of art. I'm just taking a stab at drawing, concentrating really hard."
"Brennan: Yeah, you see that Esther has… Still has a little bit of that punk edge, but also is now like cozy core punk, like long, long cardigan that she's wearing. She sort of smiles, looks over to you and says,"
Esther: Should I hold a pose over here? Is there some sort of way I should be? Or am I free to...?
"Ricky: Yeah. You know, from what I understand, it seems like people talk about people staying still. But if you feel like moving around, maybe I'll just figure it out."
Esther: Sounds--
"Ricky: It could be cool if you're moving around in the picture, but I'm not sure how to do that yet."
"Brennan: She says,"
Esther: I'll try to keep it still here.
"Brennan: Your guys' morning progresses. Esther grabs some breakfast for herself, dives into reviewing stuff. A lot of her work these days is not only arcane, but like running the Occult Society. You see a couple of minutes later, she grabs her phone, FaceTimes her mom real quick, Gabriela Sinclair. No longer one of the Furies of Tompkins square park, but rather the curse having been broken by Kugrash, Gabriela is now living elsewhere in Brooklyn. She see that, she goes like,"
"Esther: Hey Mom, thanks for jumping on the call real quick. I just wanted to go over some of this stuff with you because it's a little bit baffling to me, but I wanted to check and see if you would be familiar with any of this stuff."
"Brennan: And is like screen sharing with her mom from a laptop some like arcane symbols and stuff. Her mom, Gabriela, as the phone is scribbled around, looks over and goes,"
"Gabriela: Is that Ricky I see in the background? Good morning, Ricky!"
"Ricky: [waving] Hey, how's it going? I'm just sketching… I'm gonna incorporate you into the sketch."
"Brennan: You see that Gabriela smiles and goes,"
"Gabriela: Ah, oh, that's so sweet Ricky. Oh my goodness, you look amazing. You look wonderful..."
Zac: I'm doing squats while I...
"Brennan: You see that Gabriela looks at Esther and goes like,"
"Gabriela: Oh Ricky, I wanted to send you something I was looking up."
"Brennan: And you see a text [buzzing] shows up on your phone from Esther's mom. She says,"
"Gabriela: There was something very interesting that's happened in our neighborhood, a jewelry store opened up. It's very interesting, there's a whole new jewelry shop around the corner from me that opened up. And I was wondering, you know, I need to go-- you understand that I was cursed to be a sort of fury, like this sort of sorceress spirit of New York City for a long time. So I'm just trying to kind of pick up the pieces, start back up, get back into the world of mortals so to speak."
Ricky: [confused] Did I talk to you about jewelry?
"Gabriela: Well, no, it’s just--"
Ricky: Did we have a conversation about jewelry?
"Gabriela: Well, no cause you were saying you might want to lend a hand, and I have some jewelry shopping that I wanna do, and I was thinking that maybe you would..."
"Ricky: I'm not… I mean, I'll go with you. I don't know that I'm necess..."
"Brennan: You see, Esther says,"
"Esther: Oh, that's all for now, mom! Thank you."
Brennan: Click. And hits the button.
"Ricky: I just forget, did we talk about..."
"Brennan: Esther looks and says,"
"Esther: You didn't forget anything, sweetie. You didn't forget it. You didn't forget a single thing. You forgot nothing. My mom is being a pest, and you don't have to worry about her."
Ricky: What a weird conversation.
Cast laughs.
"Brennan: As you get ready to head out to work for the day, you see Esther looks over and says… looking over and it's just sort of feeding herself… She's kind of talks her work out loud to you a lot, and says,"
"Esther: It's just so cool because like, we have all these applicants, and just Sofia has been working so hard, and we've been able to devote so much more time to looking for applicants. And there's so many cool people. Like, look at this guy. I think this guy we have to induct into the society. We're gonna have to figure out some way to open up a secret magic alley and have him stumble down it and discover that magic is real. This is the fun part of the job, 100%."
Ricky: It sounds really cool. I can picture what you're talking about.
"Esther: Oh, it's great. It's getting to show up and tell people, “Magic is real, you might be a wizard.” Extremely, extremely fun. Oh, look at this."
"Brennan: She says,  "
"Esther: I think this guy's it for sure. This is a guy who's working at Columbia University on… This physics work is phenomenal, and that's the thing."
"Brennan: Then she starts sort of going off about it and then says,"
Esther: Am I keeping you here? You have to run off to work?
"Ricky: Yeah, I probably should get going."
"Zac: Do I know any of these people, that she's looking at?"
"Brennan: You go ahead and look at it. It seems like there's a couple of different people here that all… Esther is kind of like, branched out and is looking for people that are not just like people who are interested in the occult, but people that are like in the humanities, in STEM, people that are doing incredibly advanced mathematics and physics and stuff. She's like,"
"Esther: I don't know why it feels… I just feel like there's a way to involve more people here in the order to get a variety of perspectives. I feel like a lot of times the more fusty and old school a person has their approach, like we're never gonna be as good at the old hermetic magic stuff as those old timers were. But you can bring a fresh perspective from another discipline and really reorient what we understand about the Umbral Engine, the Umbral Arcana… Did you know, I just learned after inheriting the headmaster stuff--"
"Brennan: And you see a moment of sadness pass over her face any time she kind of talks about inheriting the headmaster. It's been three years since Alejandro died, but still, that was like her mentor. She says,"
"Esther: Alejandro was so smart. And there was so much stuff. Like I didn't know, the Umbral Arcana is not a spell effect. The Umbral Arcana is a naturally occurring substance, and the Unreal Engine is just like controlling it. The magic is about harnessing a thing that already exists naturally in the Sixth Borough. Like I didn't even know that until I got access to this stuff. There's so much exciting work ahead of us."
Ricky: Wow. Sounds like a dam.
"Esther: Kind of, yeah. It kind of is like that. Yeah, exactly. It's..."
"Ricky: I read an article about a dam three weeks ago, and it sounded similar to that."
"Brennan: You see she gets up, she sees you, comes out of her hyper work state and comes over and says,"
Esther: That's awesome. It's exactly like a dam.
"Ricky: Awesome. It sounds like a really exciting work. And yeah, what you're talking about, it's always great to get like a fresh perspective. Like when I'm doing, I don't know, CrossFit. And then, when I'm going to mix it up, and I do like a dodgeball league or something, that's fun. And that's like I'm learning a different way to exercise."
"Esther: That's exactly it, sweetie. It's a different way to exercise, that's exactly right."
"Brennan: She just smiles and wraps her arms around you, gives you a kiss and says,"
Esther: Have a great day at work. I know you're gonna do amazing things. You're… Uhg. My goodness. Mr. March.
"Ricky: Oh, I mean, I don't know. I feel like my days of being on a calendar are long gone."
"Brennan: You see that she waggles her eyebrows at you and says,"
"Esther: We can always do like a private photo shoot. Do just like a calendar, just every-month-is-March calendar, [wiggles eyebrows] if you want."
Ricky: Every month is March?
Cast laughs.
"Esther: All right, sweetie, you have a great day at work."
Zac: I hand her my horrible drawing and I get out.
"Brennan: You head out to the street. Ricky, you head off to the street. You're walking Ox along, you're headed to the place where you’ve been working for the past two and a half years or so, the Helping Hands Homeless Center and Outreach program. And you are walking through Clinton Hill, how's Ricky feeling as he heads to work?"
"Zac: I think Ricky's feeling good, you know, it's like a good morning. He got up, had his routine. Everything felt like a normal, good day so far. And I think he's just ready to get after it."
Brennan: Hell yeah. You run by… Give me a Perception check real quick.
Zac: Do I still have advantage from...
"Brennan: Yes, you do."
Zac: I rolled a 22.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You're heading off to the homeless outreach center where you work, and you see, off from the distance, just sort of on sort of a side street, sort of rolling around the corner, you just look and see your old company's fire truck kind of round the corner and head off down the street for the moment."
"Ricky: I mean, I should say “hey”."
Zac: And I sprint after it as fast as as possible.
"Brennan: Summoning that superhuman speed, you rip around the corner and go along. And you see the three Johns are in the back of the firetruck."
Ricky: John cubed!
"Brennan: You see they turn around and they go,"
Johns: [gasps] Ricky!
"Brennan: And all of them in their full gear leap off the truck, pick you up in a big hug. And they're like,"
"Johns: Dude, how is it going these days? Man, look at you. Dude, you look swole as hell. Looks like you're taking care of yourself."
Ricky: I am taking care of myself because that's how you take care of others. You take care of yourself first.
Johns: You take care of yourself first.
"Brennan: You see all of them at the same time go,"
Johns: You put your own oxygen mask on before you put it on the p...
"Ricky: I mean, that's just being safe. But yeah, I'm doing good. Me and Esther moved in together."
John: Nice.
"Ricky: I'm working at the Helping Hands Homeless Outreach place. And yeah, shit's great."
"John: Dude, that is awesome, dude. It's so great that you found someone that takes care of you, that you can take care of. That kind of intimacy, that's what life's all about, dude. And the number one thing you can do when you get is you can give, man, and that's you to a T, dude."
"Ricky: Aww, that's you, John."
Zac: I pick him up.
"Brennan: Yeah, he goes,"
"John: Yeah, getting picked up!"
"Brennan: Each of you guys take about a minute and a half to each pick up each of other, including the three guys who are gonna go back into the same fire truck together."
"Ricky: So, what are you up to? What are you guys up to you?"
"John: Ah dude, there's a fire. We gotta get going, man."
"Ricky: Yeah, sorry."
Zac: I put them back onto the firetruck.
"Brennan: You lift them up one by one,"
"Johns: Rock and roll, dude. Huge core strength man, way to go. Take care, Rick."
Brennan: And you see the truck takes off.
"Zac: I think a part of Ricky misses it a little bit, but also, he's happy"
doing what he's doing.
"Brennan: Yeah. You get to Helping Hands, you have a great day working at the center. There's like a food drive going on right now, you're helping unload boxes for that and get things stored and separated. And yeah, just that little wistful pang of seeing the fire truck drive off into the distance."
[54:16 - Pete’s Intro]
"We whisk away from the firehouse to our next character. We are up in Uncommon Knowledge. We actually dive all the way up back to Harlem, to a tiny little bookstore, an awesome second-hand bookstore, all used books, a lot of old awesome things like that. There's a small little wooden sign outside that says Uncommon Knowledge, sort of tucked off the corner, a few blocks away from 125th street. This beautiful, magical, rich smelling of old dusty paper. And even as old and crowded as the bookstore is, you see that there is a little shelf outside where people can just take books. There's books that the store has basically said like, hey, just take one. There's also a little wheelchair ramp leading up into this sort of old building. And we go inside to see the man behind the register at the front of the store. Ally, could you please describe your character for us?"
"Ally: Yes. Hello, everyone. Yeah, Pete is just at work. He's been trying to sit up straight lately. He realized his posture is kind of lacking, and I think he's just kind of really focusing on that, kind of having like an anxious day. Just kind of like clothes are fitting weird and just like,"
"Pete: [moving his shoulders around] You know, maybe it's a posture thing. Yeah, all right."
"Ally: So he's just kinda like at the register, like [Ally sits up, chin down almost touching their chest]"
Cast laughs.
"Brennan: Looking around, posture's kind of weird. You see that your… One of your coworkers comes in to replace you. You see, they come in… Their name is Zee Silverman. This is actually one of the few close work buds you have. You see, they come in, they got big glasses, kind of little flop of like fluorescent orange, pink and yellow hair. They have their little pronoun pin on the lapel of their jacket saying “they/them” on it. And you see that they are also a wheelchair user. So coming across the ramp, give you a little peace sign and go,"
"Zee: Hey Pete, how's the morning shift going?"
"Pete: Hey Zee, it was great. We actually had one of those school tours, so, you know. The place was full of kids, and I just kind of had to clean up a bunch of juice."
"Zee: Sorry, is there like... Are there like juice stains around?"
"Pete: No, I got most of them up. But you know the place fills with kids. It's like let's really inspire a love of reading in these kids, but they always spill juice multiple places."
"Zee: Okay, I feel like that's actually… Okay, that might be a bigger deal if the books all have juice on-- How many kids had juice? You said it was a high school group?"
"Pete: No, no, no. They were little kids, it was like third grade or something. They were probably like 30, 35 of them. And I would say at least 15 of them had an open juice."
"Brennan: You see that Zee goes,"
"Zee: Okay, I'm gonna run to the bathroom and kind of just like eat my lunch super quick, and then I'll come tap you out."
"Pete: Yeah, no worries. Yeah, yeah, no worries. No rush. I got all the juice up, I dunno if I made that clear. I'm not leaving you with a big mess."
"Zee: Gotcha, no worries. That's totally, totally fine. Cool, I'm gonna go scarf my lunch down real quick. I'm gonna run to the bathroom."
"Brennan: You see that they head back, they say,"
"Zee: You need to be out of here at like pretty sharp cause you said you're looking at an apartment later today, is that right?"
"Pete: Yeah! Yeah, I am. I would love to get to that on time. It seems like when you show up late, they're always like... upset."
"Zee: No, it's like hell, finding a place in the city, for sure."
"Brennan: You see that they head back to the bathroom in the back of the store, and you hear the door kind of jingle again. One of the school chaperones comes back in with one of the young sort of like third or fourth grade kids. And they're the chaperone goes like,"
"Chaperone: All right, sweetie. Where do we think we lost it? It's gotta be somewhere here, right? We gotta find it so that we can grab the..."
"Pete: Oh, what'd you guys leave? I can help you find it."
"Brennan: You see the kid looks up at you, and they are looking at you with like wide, wide eyes. You see, they've got like a little school uniform with a skirt on, like beads in their hair. And you see the kid looking up at you in like wide-eyed amazement. Go ahead and give me an Insight check with advantage."
"Ally: Ooh. Oh, yeah, honey, that's an 18."
"Brennan: Pete is looking down at this kid— who very clearly is in like a school uniform skirt, like beads in their hair— You're getting two different vibes from this kid at the same time. You're getting number one, kid looking at a queer adult and with a look of like recognition and wonderment. And you're also getting maybe something else beyond that as well. The kid looks around and is like,"
"Kid: Yeah, I was looking around at the different books and stuff and found a bunch of… So, it's like a little teddy bear backpack."
"Brennan: And you see that they look up at you and say,"
"Kid: It's a little brown teddy bear, but it's got backpack straps built into it. It's my little teddy bear backpack."
"Pete: Oh, that's really cool. I love stuff like that. Okay, man. Yeah, let's look around."
"Ally: And I just kinda like help look around. And then I say to the chaperone,"
Pete: Do you know where they left it? Do you know which areas they were in?
"Brennan: The chaperone shrugs. And you see the kid points over at a stack of books and says,"
Kid: Maybe it might've been behind there.
"Brennan: The chaperones start looking. And the kid just turns to look up at you. And they're again, like about nine years old. And you see that they just sort of wave at you and go,"
Kid: Hi. What's your name?
"Pete: [struggling] Um. It's Pete. Oh, that's so hard to do. Sorry, it's Pete. My real name is Pete. I'll tell you my real name, and it's Pete."
"Brennan: The kid sort of nods and looks up and says,"
"Kid: Cool, cool."
Pete: What's your name?
"Brennan: The little kid says,"
Kid: Amanda.
Pete: Cool.
"Brennan: Yeah. And I think Pete on the 18 Insight can tell that this little nine year old is having those early, early feelings of like, “Maybe I don't want this to be my name forever.”"
"Pete: Cool, do you like that name? [Amanda shrugs.] Do you have any nicknames that you go by or?"
"Amanda: Well, there's a lot of other Amanda's in the school, and my last name is Daniels, and so sometimes, I get called Amanda D, and sometimes I get called Dee for short, and I kinda like the nickname Dee."
"Pete: Yeah, that's a cool nickname. We have someone who works here, their name is Zee."
Brennan: You see that Amanda's eyes light up as they look at you. And they quickly look over your shoulder as a little flicker of a green light in the shape of a butterfly just moves around. And that one was not one that you even made visible to other people. It just moves around for a second. But you see that Amanda sees it.
"Pete: Huh. You know, you can start to make your own reality. You know, you can tell people how you'd like to be perceived, and it's never too early to start that. You should tell everyone that your name’s Dee."
"Brennan: Dee looks up at you with just tears like forming, and just smiles. The chaperone lifts the teddy bear up out of the thing and says,"
"Chaperone: Is this it? Okay, let's get out of here."
"Brennan: And Dee smiles at you. And just again, is looking at you with like that rapt fascination of like, what a cool person! And like, I'm nine, I don't get-- Yeah, like."
"Ally: I think I have the butterfly fly around and then I make a circle with my hands and the butterfly flies through it. And I'm like,"
"Pete: Bye, Dee!"
Emily: [laughs] Like vape tricks with it.
"Brennan: Dee waves so excitedly, goes,"
"Dee: Bye, Pete! [excitedly blows kisses]"
Brennan: And like blows kisses and waves and smiles and walks off back into the street.
"Pete: [sighs, smiling] Ah, best part of the job."
"Brennan: Yes. The Vox Phantasma of New York City bringing a little bit of the dream world into the waking. Zee comes out, replaces you, cuts you loose. You guys have an apartment to go head out and see. You check your phone for the info, and as you're sort of heading to the subway, I think Pete recognizes that you hadn't checked your phone for a good like 40 minutes. And there are no texts waiting on it when you look up. And it's just a very different life."
Ally: And I only have one phone now. A total bore for me. Hmm.
"Brennan: You begin to head off towards the subway looking at that phone. Probably the most recent texts are from Dr. Lugash. And actually, yeah. The most recent text is morning from Dr. Lugash checking in about coming to tomorrow's meeting and just making sure you're there."
"Ally: Oh, yeah. I shoot him a text back."
"Pete: Oh, sorry, was at work. Yeah, I'll definitely be there."
"Brennan: Awesome, great. You head off into the city."
Ally: I think I'm eating just like the worst food ever before meeting someone good. I have like a four-pack of like White Castle sliders.
Murph: You’re eating them cold?
[speakers cross talking over each other]
"Ally: Mm-hmm, just eating them so cold."
Siobhan: No.
Ally: I got them on the way to work.
"Murph: So, they're defrosted?"
"Zac: You just didn't have time, yeah."
[1:05:45 - Sofia’s Intro]
"Brennan: Incredible. From there, we move and zoom up away from Harlem all the way back down, moving, moving, moving, all the way to Staten Island."
"[Emily laughs, Murph claps]"
"Brennan: All the way to Staten Island, to a small… I honestly think one bedroom apartment shared--"
"Emily: Okay, one bedroom. We upgraded from studio."
Brennan: Upgraded from studio. A one bedroom above Spaghetti's Bakery.
[Lou laughs]
Emily: The smell of the cannolis wafts in through the windows.
"Brennan: Coming back from a morning shift at first-class luxury, beauty hair salon, Sofia Lee, you walk through the door of your apartment after you had about like three back-to-back appointments today."
"Sofia: They all wanted the Rachel. It's back, I guess."
"Brennan: You walk in and see that all the living spaces are completely occupied by yet another deep clean of the entire apartment. The curtains have been laundered, there's piles of laundry being folded everywhere. Your mom walks in, who you are now living with, Marie Bicicleta walks in and goes,"
"Marie: Okay, I couldn't tell cause you're separating your whites from the colors, but you're also separating the delicates from everything else. So, I went through and re-separated and rewashed. If anything's not in the right place, you let me know."
"Sofia: Mom, I don't care. Throw it all in one load. It's clothes, who cares?"
"Marie: I'm not gonna put your delicate-- I'm not gonna put lace or anything like that. First of all, this is--"
"Sofia: [shouting] Mother, what need do I have for delicates in my life? Do you think anyone sees my delicates besides you?"
"Marie: [shouting, clapping hands together as if wearing acrylic nails] Maybe you want to find someone who wants to see your delicates!"
"Sofia: [tearing up] Maybe my delicates are just private for a little while, okay?"
Marie: [clapping again] “Private” doesn't mean “nobody's” sweetheart!
"Sofia: Let them get destroyed by the dryer, I don't care! No one's looking at my delicates, end of sentence!"
"Brennan: You see, she looks out and says,"
"Marie: [tearing up] I don't understand why you yell at me, I'm trying to help you—"
"Sofia: I know, I know—"
"Marie: — God forbid, your own mother-- I mean, you think I like to go through and look at my daughter's lingerie? You should be able to do this for yourself. But you got these—"
"Sofia: I know, I know—"
Marie: — Who has a hair appointment at 1:30 in the morning? Why do you have hair appointments at such strange times of night?
"Sofia: I told you I have some very particular clients and I'm on-call. I'm an on-call hairdresser, this is absolutely normal. You didn't know that the salon has a graveyard shift? It does. Okay? Nothing to see. I cut hair, that's all I do, Mom. That's all I do."
"Marie: But why are they making you pull so many doubles? You go work in the morning, you work a graveyard shift at night. Sweetheart, [clapping] where is the time in your life to meet a man? Nobody is co— There are no men at the hair salon, sweetheart."
"Sofia: Mom, I absolutely appreciate what you're doing. But you got to understand that right now work keeps me out of the bottle. And so, maybe it's not such a bad thing."
"Marie: [holding hands up defensively] Okay. All right, forgive me. She knows! She knows the card up the sleeve to make Mom agree. So, there you go. There you go, play the card that makes Mom have to shut up."
"Sofia: Yeah. And just so you know, if you try to sign me up for Tinder one more time-- I mean, you shouldn't do it, because what did you do? You uploaded my high school senior photo, and then the bio was a Bible quote? Mother!"
Marie: You look beautiful! Why shouldn't we--
"Sofia: It was… nothing but predators, I'll be honest. It was just not a strategic… It was not strategic."
Brennan: She holds up an iPhone that she has had made so that the font is like enormously large on it.
Sofia: I can read one word on that.
"Brennan: She says,"
"Marie: Yes, there only needs to be one word, which is “match”! And you've gotten 18! I run your account better than you do. Look at this conversation, this guy is a sergeant in the fire department. And look at this, he texted me saying, “Hey, what's up? I love the corsage in your main photo.” And look what I said. I said—"
"Sofia: What did you say, mother? I wanna know what you said."
"Marie: \-- “Me—”, I said, “Me, parentheses Sofia, am single and available.”"
"Sofia: I take it back, you just seem like you're catfishing. You just seem like you're catfishing."
Marie: What's catfishing? People keep saying I'm doing that. Does that mean you're doing well?
"Sofia: No, it means that people think that you're pretending to be one person and you're not. And honestly, that is what's happening here. You're catfishing for a good cause. But nevertheless, the cat has been fished."
"Brennan: You see she goes,"
"Marie: Okay, well, I guess I can't win. There's a lot of lovely men on here. The ones that— There are some that I find distasteful, but you gotta throw a lot of lines before you land a fish, sweetheart!"
"Sofia: Okay, Mother, I'm just gonna say one thing. I'm not the only single woman in this one bedroom apartment. So."
Marie: First of all...
Sofia: Is it possible that you are focusing on me because you don't want to look at what's going on with you?
"Marie: First of all, I am not single. I am still married to that scum of the ear-- I don't even want to say his name, all right?"
Sofia: I don't want you to say it either.
"Marie: Women in my generation, we don't get divorced, okay? And if I ever see the man I'm married to again, whose name I won't say, I'll kill him. And I want you to know that. He's dead to me. But I am not single, okay? I have beautiful children, my beautiful daughter."
Brennan: And she comes over and grabs your face. [He mimes holding her face and kisses one side then the other]
"Marie: I love you, I love you, I love you. I know I can be a nudge, I just want you to be happy, okay?"
"Sofia: I know. I know, mom, I know."
"Marie: All right, I'm gonna finish the laundry. I'm gonna go get some sandwiches downstairs, and we'll get you something to eat cause I know you gotta head out again in not too long."
"Sofia: Yeah, absolutely. A lot of hair needs to be cut in this city. A lot of Rachels. I got to turn a lot of zeros into Rachels."
"Brennan: Your mom heads out. Also, introducing a new little game system here for those watching at home."
"Emily: Oh, right."
"Brennan: Yeah, so for everyone at home, Dimension 20 for this season, the Unsleeping City, because Sofia and Pete are both sober at the moment, we actually consulted with some awesome sobriety and addiction consultants to create kind of an extension of the Adaine Abernant panic attack system into a system to accurately reflect our characters as they work on their sobriety. So both Ally and Emily have a list of sort of sobriety triggers for Sofia and Pete. Fighting with your mom is one of Sofia's. So you go ahead, you're at a D20 right now because you've been doing meetings and you are doing very well."
"Emily: I've been sober two years, three months, and 17 days. Not three years because after Kug passed, I went on a nine month bender, but um. I, yeah. Okay, I passed, I got a 5."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, great. Awesome."
Lou gives an “OK” hand sign.
"Sofia: It's okay. Sofia, still your mind. She wants the best for you. You don't let the shame of starting a fight with someone who wants the best for you just fall off of you like water in the shower."
"Brennan: You center yourself, you're feeling good. Sofia and Pete, you guys feel free to make those rolls even when I'm not calling for them as well. So, very cool. Sofia, you look at your phone. I think Sofia is probably the most on the ball in terms of tomorrow being Halloween."
"Emily: Oh, yeah. I've got pumpkin earrings. I'm wearing leopard print pants. I know you're talking about magical, but I am saying Sofia is also decked out for Halloween. Pumpkin earrings, big pumpkin shirt, a pumpkin full of Halloween candy that she brings to every place she works."
Brennan: Incredible.
Emily: And also she's aware that magic will be in a potent stage tomorrow.
"Brennan: Hell yes. So before you sort of have your business tonight, you see a little reminder of an appointment that you actually have in the city on the upper west side. You got a spot with your psychic today as well."
"Emily: Ah, yes. Okay. Well, yeah, you know what? This will be good because I just had a fight with my mother. I'm like feeling just kind of icky from that. So I will just… I don't want to take the Staten Island ferry. So do I have a car at all?"
Brennan: Go ahead and make a flat Wisdom check for me.
"Emily: Okay. I got a 19 plus, hold on. 19 plus 3, 22. This is probably just gonna tell me I absolutely don't."
[Siobhan laughs]
"Brennan: You absolutely have access to a car. Your brother, Mario, stole a car, which you stole so he can't report it."
"Emily: Okay. [laughs] Yes. Great, I get in the car. I plug my iPhone in, I start blasting music, and I hop on the Verrazano bridge to take a really indirect route to the Upper West Side."
"Brennan: Yeah, go on the Verrazano upf the BQE over the Triborough down to the Upper West Side."
"Emily: I love traffic, it's something to do when you're sober."
"Brennan: A while later, as you're driving, you see that in the radio... So, what kind of music do you have playing on the radio right now?"
"Emily: I think I just, whatever station was on."
"Brennan: You see that the stations are [imitating signal change] and settles on a super fun merengue station, as you— and starts playing. And as it happens, appearing next to you is your patron in the passenger seat made of light, purring."
"La Gran Gata: [licks paw and grooms herself] Ah, mija, you look beautiful today."
Sofia: Gracias.
"Brennan: You see, La Gran Gata smiles at you, the great bodega cat of New York and says,"
"La Gran Gata: Are we perhaps going hunting later tonight, or perhaps tomorrow? I know there are many that will steal the visage of the sexy cat."
"Sofia: I mean, we've gone hunting every single night since I've been sober. So yeah, we'll be hunting, yeah. What are you in the mood to hunt for?"
"Brennan: You see, La Gran Gata says,"
"La Gran Gata: It is all good to me whatever, wrongdoers, wicked, and licentious orcs, wander the streets threatening the innocent people of this city. If we could also find some... mice or say-- I know that you don't ever want me to..."
Sofia: No rats.
La Gran Gata: No rats.
Sofia: We don't do rats.
La Gran Gata: We don't do rats.
Sofia: We respect the rats.
La Gran Gata: We respect the rats.
Sofia: Okay.
"La Gran Gata: But maybe a full pigeon one time, you know?"
Sofia: Hmm. I'm kind of torn because I knew a pigeon that once loved the rat. But I'll let ya have the pigeons.
"La Gran Gata: Okay, good, good, good, good. [meows]"
[1:18:54 - Iga’s Intro]
"Brennan: And La Gran Gata sort of twinkles out in light. And you arrive on West 72nd street. Not like-- around Columbus, like not too far away from Central Park. Tucked away, not one of the main avenues. But there's a series of metal stairs going down to a shopfront that is partially subterranean. You see a neon sign flickering ‘Psychic’. And it's a weird neon sign cause it's flickering. But you can only see this storefront if you look down the stairwell outside of the building. You see a kind of crystal ball in the windows, psychic, cards read. You see the name on the front that says… That's like partially in Cyrillic letters, sort of Russian font that says “Madam Anastasia” on the front of it."
"Emily: And I've been here before, right? Cause I'm kind of using… I'm leaning on this psychic instead of being an adult and going to a therapist."
"Brennan: Yes. Also, you know this psychic because this is a psychic who got recommended to you because you can actually talk about your Unsleeping City stuff here. This psychic is partially connected to or inducted into the Unsleeping City. And you are familiar-- In other words, you can be your full self here."
Emily: Okay. I go in.
Sofia: Madam Anastasia? Madam Anastasia?
"Brennan: A woman emerges from the back. Siobhan, could you please describe your character for us?"
[Lou cheers]
"Siobhan: [elderly Polish lady accent] Yes, I am Anastasia, Madam Anastasia. I am one of the great psychics of New York City. All of those other psychics I've got to say are frauds, but me, I am the real thing. I read cards for my ladies, the Upper West side, the Upper East side, the Lower West side, the Lower East side. All kinds of people all over the city, they come to me from my readings because they're so accurate and real. I'm 45 years young, I've got beautiful curly hair that I have wrapped in a scarf because people have a certain expectation of what their psychics are looking like. And I do have a pair of Tevas on also because you can’t really see the Tevas underneath the beautiful tablecloth that I have to do my readings on."
Ally: [delighted] Secret Tevas!
Emily: Can I do a Perception to try to see the Tevas?
[Siobhan and cast laugh]
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a Perception check.
"Emily: Okay. Shit, sorry."
"Brennan: And Siobhan, give me a Stealth check."
Lou: Gotta hide those Tevas.
Siobhan: I got a 10 Stealth.
Murph: Oh no.
"Ally: Oh no, there is a Teva poking out."
Emily: I got a 16.
Siobhan: I quickly pull my Tevas underneath.
Emily: I make a note to get her a nice pair of shoes.
"Anastasia: You’ve gotta be comfortable, you know it's important to be comfortable. You got to walk around the city a lot, you know what I mean?"
Sofia: Madam Anastasia.
Anastasia: Mmm.
Sofia: I got into a big fight with my mother.
Anastasia: Oh dear.
Sofia: It's the same song and dance.
Anastasia: Yes.
Sofia: She wants me to start dating again. I don't really know how to... be someone who is not living in... the memory of Dale. And I guess I thought maybe we could just do some tarot cards.
"Anastasia: Yes, of course, you want to do tarot cards--"
Sofia: Seems like that would be the adult solution.
Anastasia: What is your question that you would like to ask to the cards? I want you to close your eyes and concentrate very hard on this question.
Sofia: Okay.
Ally: I love this.
Sofia: My question will be… [sighs] is it okay to fall in love again?
"Anastasia: Hmm, a beautiful question, very good. Okay."
"Sofia: Thank you so much, your support means everything."
"Anastasia: I'm going to cut the deck when you tell me to cut the deck, okay?"
Sofia: Okay— [immediately] Cut the deck! Did I surprise you?
Anastasia: Okay.
[Lou laughs]
Sofia: Okay.
"Anastasia: Let us see what the cards they have in store for you, Sofia."
Sofia: Okay.
"Anastasia: Hmm, your past: the Ace of Ones. One man, strong, virile. [holds card up to camera]"
"Sofia: Yes, he was strong, he was virile. He was-- we had a really quiet, beautiful relationship, but also a [quietly] nasty sex life."
[Murph bursts out laughing and covers his face with his hands]
"Anastasia: [crosstalk] Oh, that sounds… honestly? Sounds perfect to me. Absolutely."
"Sofia: [crosstalk] So I think you're right, you're right. That card is absolutely right."
"Anastasia: The present, what are we saying? Oh. Oh my goodness. [holds card up to camera] A card of ill omen, the Tower. I think, my dear, you're not ready to date yet. It's a card of change, of fall. Your life is in a time of flux."
"Sofia: Oh… [rapt expression][nodding] Okay… you’re right, you’re right, it is."
Anastasia: Things are moving around—
"Sofia: [quitely, nodding] Yeah…"
Anastasia: — You don't have time to date—
"Sofia: [quietly, shaking her head] No…"
Anastasia: — You are falling out of a Tower!
[Ally bursts out laughing and covers their face with their hands]
Sofia: [speaking faintly] I don’t have time— I’m falling— I'm falling out of a tower? I’m falling—
"Anastasia: You're falling out of a tower, but it's okay because [crosstalk] we're going to rebuild this tower together."
"Sofia: [crosstalk] Okay, how do I stop falling? What do I grab onto, Anastasia? What do I grab onto?"
"Anastasia: No, you grab onto yourself."
Sofia: [quietly] What?
"Anastasia: Because you are the strong one, you see?"
"Sofia: Ah… ah, there was a time in my life when I was supposed to choose myself, and it took me a long time. [laughs]"
"Anastasia: I understand, you— you know, when you're a woman in this life, sometimes it takes a long time to be like, “Oh, I got to choose myself sometimes.” You know what I mean?"
Sofia: Yeah…
Anastasia: That's okay. But you got to choose yourself.
Sofia: Okay.
"Anastasia: And let's see what this future holding for you. Oh, well this is a very handsome looking man. [holds card up to camera] We don't see his face yet. We're not sure who he is. The Three of Wands."
"Sofia: Oh… Wow. [crosstalk] Three wands, huh."
[Murph wheezes in laughter]
"Anastasia: [crosstalk] But it looks he's going on a journey. Three of Wands. Hey, maybe it is. Maybe you've got three wands coming to you. Maybe this is what's happening in near future."
Sofia: [crosstalk] Oh my… oh my...
Anastasia: [crosstalk] It's three men. Do you think you can handle three men at a time?
"Sofia: I don't know, my palms are sweating. I feel guilty about even handling one man. Oh, Anastasia, you always give me so much to think about."
"Anastasia: I think having things to think about is very important for you. You know it— I think it's okay for you to not date for a little bit. It's okay. But also, we're looking for these three men. We're looking for these dark, handsome three men who are coming into your life. Keep your mind open, keep your heart open."
"Sofia: Okay, [laughing] my heart is open."
Anastasia: And keep other things open as well. You need to keep them open.
Sofia: [chanting] My heart is open to three men. My heart is open to three men.
"Brennan: The bell of the door rings, and a man walks into the psychic shop. He is wearing a sort of blue windbreaker, sweatpants, and socks and sandals. He's got a sort of gold chain, chest hair poking out of the sort of top of the windbreaker, chin strap beard. You recognize this as Yagdash Scrovich."
Lou: [laughing] Yagdash.
Brennan: It's Yagdash. It's Yagdash!
Lou: It's Yagdash!
"Brennan: You see Yagdash comes in, looks over at [air quotes] “Madam Anastasia” and goes,"
"Yagdash: Hello, Mrs. Liskowski, I have bag of illegal drug money?"
"Siobhan: Mmm, I say in Polish,"
"Anastasia: Yagdash, what are you doing? I'm clearly in a reading, you're saying “illegal money”. What are you doing?"
"Yagdash: No, but you are cash business, so we do the money laundering here?"
"Anastasia: No, no, Yagdash, you know when the sign is popping, you don't come hopping, you know what I mean? I'm doing a reading. It's basic crime stuff here, Yagdash."
"Yagdash: Oh, wait, you do the card reading for real? Because… because like, we own the pizza place, but it's not… We don't really make..."
"Anastasia: Yagdash, if I don't do the reading for real, the cops, they know that it's a fake business."
"Yagdash: Ohh, and the cops arrest you for crimes."
"Anastasia: No, they arrest you for crimes!"
"Yagdash: What, you know this? Do you read this in the cards?"
"Anastasia: If you keep on… Yes, I read it in the cards, Yagdash, if you don't-- [crosstalk] you can’t start being smarter about this--"
Brennan: [crosstalk] Yagdash pulls a gun out of his— He pulls a gun out of his bag of money—
"Anastasia: [wagging a finger] No, the cards say you've got to just be smarter."
"Brennan: He runs into the bathroom, locks the door, and you hear him go,"
Yagdash: [yelling] Nobody let the cops inside!
"Brennan: You hear, BLAM!, and then you hear-- [scream]"
"Anastasia: [pressing her fingers exasperatedly into her brow] Yagdash… My roof… This is a rented office space, Yagdash. If I don't get my deposit back, this is on you-- Why are you shooting guns inside?"
Yagdash: They are for the cops!
"Siobhan: I turn to Sofia and I say,"
"Anastasia: I am so sorry, this..."
Yagdash: The bullets bounce off the pipe and hit me in the ass!
Anastasia: [crosstalk] I don’t know what [laughing] this boy is doing.
Sofia: Is this a former lover of yours?
"Anastasia: I will do another card for you, Sofia."
"Sofia: That was all Polish, I don't know what you guys said. Was that a former lover?"
[Lou laughs]
Sofia: [crosstalk] Current lover?... Future lover?
"Anastasia: [crosstalk] Let's do another card for you just to see what about this future lover, you know? So let's close your eyes and concentrate, maybe your ears as well. Concentrate very hard."
"Sofia: Oh… Okay, close my eyes… Okay."
"Emily: Okay, I put some airpods in. [closes her eyes]"
Siobhan: I open the door to the bathroom and kick Yagdash out.
"Brennan: He limps out with just an ass covered in blood. And he goes,"
"Yagdash: Okay, I still leave— I leave the drug money still for you."
"Anastasia: Yes, leave the drug money, go to the hospital you idiot. What are you doing?"
Yagdash: That's where the cops will be looking for me first thing.
"Anastasia: No, go to Dr. Lugash, what are you doing?"
"Yagdash: I go to Dr. Lugash, you see."
Anastasia: You’ve been doing this for yea— I've got to talk to your aunt.
"Brennan: He takes a burner out and calls, and he goes,"
"Yagdash: Dr. Lugash, I did a crime in the bathroom."
Anastasia: [interrupting] Not in here! Leave the-- leave!
Yagdash: Okay.
"Brennan: You see he walks out the door, Yagdash leaves. So, Sofia, you conclude your reading there that afternoon with Madam Anastasia. And Madam Anastasia, or as her real name is actually Iga Lisowski. Iga, you know that your daughter's having a sleepover with some school friends tonight."
Siobhan: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: This was your last appointment of the day. But your daughter is like hosting a big friends’ sleepover for the first time. It was like a big middle- school deal tonight. You see a text on your phone asking if you can get snacks from the store. And then under that, there's sort of an ellipses... and then the ellipses again, and the ellipses again, like she's thinking of saying something and not saying it."
Iga: What are these dots? What are these dots mean?
Siobhan: I text back.
"Brennan: She says,"
"Jessica: They mean I'm typing something, mom. But can I ask you a favor about tonight?"
Iga: Yes.
"Brennan: She says,"
"Jessica: It would be great if we could just get regular snacks from the store, like Oreos and chips and stuff like that, and not make a bunch of Polish snacks for my friends."
"Iga: Oh, so the Polish snacks are…you are too good for Polish snacks now? My little borscht bites, you don't like them?"
"Brennan: She texts back and she says,"
Jessica: I just want my friends to have a normal time.
"Iga: Goat's cheese is a normal cheese. Sheep's cheese is a normal cheese. But just because your friends... they only eat this American cheese, which is bad."
"Brennan: You see, she texts back and she says… Just one-word texts in like a stack, and just say,"
Jessica: please
Jessica: just
Jessica: be
Jessica: normal
Jessica: tonight
"Iga: Okay, okay. I'll get you the Oreos. I'll get you the trash food, the trash sugar food."
"Brennan: She texts back,"
"Jessica: Thank you, mom."
"Brennan: And then there was another ellipsis for a second. And then she says,"
"Jessica: Also, can we have borscht bites tomorrow? I love borscht bites."
"Iga: Yes, we can have borscht bites tomorrow."
[1:31:46 - Cody’s Intro]
"Brennan: You head off to go back to Greenpoint. We are going to cut now over to Queens, New York, baby. Massive signs hang. Caution tape all around the resplendent Queens Center Mall. One of the only true malls in New York. Manhattan of course has so many shopping districts that a real mall could never really have lived in Manhattan. But out here in Queens, the space and the population density were just perfect for the mall to end all malls, that has been shuttered and slated for demolition."
"All around, we see signs as part of a huge public relations blitz for the new largest-in-the-world, state of the art Gladiator shipping and fulfillment campus. Gladiator is one of the largest internet companies in the world. It is streaming services. It is shipment. It's online shopping. It is education. It's all kinds of stuff. It's an enormous company. And there's all these signs of like happy, enterprising professionals and smiling people talking about the new Gladiator Campus of shipping and fulfillment centers. There will be Gladiator dorms for people to like, live in the company structure, as part of the structure here. There's like a whole food court for the employees that are gonna be living here. And there's even a sign outside saying like, “Get ready for your neighborhood to have the brand new Gladiator shipping and fulfillment center. Say hi, neighbor.” And there's someone holding a little payment card that's basically like a credit card that you can get, like it's part of a rewards program to have people that can fully move off of cash and just be using like Gladiator currency."
"So you see all of this. And then— it's daytime, there's construction workers all around. This is like a long way away from being built, but the demolition is getting set up actively. Men with hard hats are walking around, construction workers. Probably across the street from this, hiding in the shadow of an awning… we see…"
[Emily cackles]
Zac covers his face as Siobhan smiles.
[heavy metal starts playing]
"Brennan: Murph, who do we see?"
"Murph: We see Cody who is a… He's a mall goth without a mall. He has a like Skrillex kind of haircut with like, long, black hair on the one side, and then shaved on the other side. And then he's got a blue streak going through his black hair. Very pale, he’s got some like eyeshadow on. So much leather."
[Siobhan laughs]
"Murph: A duster, like a long black duster. And then I think... he hates Halloween because people always think he's dressed up and compliment his costume."
[Siobhan and Emily laugh]
"Murph: And he has like, he's a real sword guy. He's got like a big replica Buster sword from Final Fantasy VII on his back, and a bunch of other swords around him, and like kunai and things like that. And ninja throwing stars."
Zac shakes his head.
Lou: [groans] Oh man.
"Murph: And always has a cigarette in his mouth, and is just eternally pissed off and was pissed off before the mall got closed down and is even more pissed now and he's just waiting for the construction workers to turn around so that he can chuck a ninja star at some of the Gladiator signs."
Cody: ‘Cause I fucking hate Gladiator.
Zac: Oh my god.
[Cast laughs]
"Emily: You have the tiniest cigarettes, it's like… smooshed."
Murph: He picks up butts off the ground and he relights them.
Cody: [takes drag from tiny cigarette] Times are lean without the mall.
"Brennan: You see a group of the construction workers kind of turn their back to you for a moment, and start moving away. You see one of— this sort of old foreman, this kind of like squat, Irish-looking guy, like white hair kind of foreman, he got a clipboard. He's going like,"
"Foreman: Yeah, so we’re gonna take this down ‘cause we gotta get the… So, the landscapers are going to come through here, they're comin’ in from 68th down to 63rd. So this is all goin’ to be campus, but we gotta get that leveled out ‘cause we gotta get the backhoe in here to uproot this tree over here."
Murph shakes his head.
"Brennan: And they sort of move a little way as a way, giving you an opportunity to huck a ninja star."
"Murph: I huck a ninja star, I try to hit… You said there was somebody with a happy face. I try to hit him like right between the eyes."
Emily: You mean a person or a poster?
"Murph: Oh, a poster. Definitely not a… [crosstalk] I'm not committing murder."
Emily: [crosstalk][laughing] Okay.
Lou: [crosstalk] Cody’s a murderer. Cody just like a—
Murph: [crosstalk] Yeah he’s— he’s not—
"Zac: [crosstalk] Murph kills a man, like a—"
Lou: Attacks all these innocent construction workers.
"Murph: No, no. Cody's a real defacing property guy. He's the guy who you'd like, sneak out at night with in high school, but just start like kicking a mailbox. You'd be like, “Dude, stop.”"
"Brennan: Cody, you huck a ninja star straight into the poster's face. As you do so, you hear the thunk. And you see that the foreman whips around and says,"
"Foreman: Hey, hey! It's that— it’s that fucking kid. Kid, you get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck out of here, buddy!"
"Cody: I'm not going fucking anywhere, dude. You get out of here."
"Foreman: Oh, I get out of here?"
Cody: Yeah.
Foreman: Go ahead and give me one good reason I shouldn't walk across this fucking street and kick your ass!
"Cody: [takes a drag] Where's your sword, bro?"
Foreman: Where's my fucking… I don't need a fucking sword.
Cody: Where's your sword? I have twelve!
"Foreman: Yeah, I'mma rip that sword out of your hands and shove it up your ass, kid!"
"Cody: [reaching over his shoulder] Yeah, you can try."
Murph: And I pull out the Buster sword.
Brennan: Immediately behind you hear [imitating a siren] and you see...
"Cody: Fuck! Oh, I'm sorry, is it illegal to fucking hit paper with ninja stars? Is it fucking illegal?"
"Brennan: You see— [laughs] yeah, you see the cops come out and they say,"
"Cop: Hey man, we clocked that Buster sword from a while away. You can't pull that on people."
"Brennan: And you just see the foreman and across the street goes,"
"Foreman: Yeah, that's right, kid! You're a long way from Transylvania, asshole!"
"Cody: Yeah, I'm not from fucking Transylvania! I worked at the fucking Hot Topic that you're fucking destroying. So actually, I belong here and you belong... on the internet? ‘Cause Gladiator’s from the fucking internet? Fuck you dude! Where's your sword? [takes a drag]"
"Brennan: You see that, [laughs] another construction worker goes,"
"Construction worker: Hey, where's your..."
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Construction worker: How come you're out in the daylight, Dracula? What the fuck is going on, man?"
"Cody: Uh, I'm actually like Blade, I'm a fucking daywalker, dude. Read a comic."
[Emily and Brennan laugh]
"Brennan: You get hassled by the cops. Do you think Cody has… This is by the way, Cody [finger quotes] “Night Angel” Walsh. Do we think Cody has like a permit for this replica Buster sword?"
Murph: [laughs] No!
[Cast laughs]
Murph: Absolutely not!
Brennan: The cops fully jack this sword.
Cody: You said I couldn't have the fucking blade sword. This one's different.
[Siobhan laughs]
"Brennan: They see, they go,"
"Cop: Look, man, it's really simple. If you're gonna have a replica weapon, you either can't have it filed down to an edge like this, or it needs to be double-bladed. A single-bladed weapon in the state of New York is an illegal weapon. You can’t, unless you are transporting it, right?"
"Cody: Yeah, I'm transporting it... to that dude's fucking head."
"Cop: Okay, so that's…"
Murph: And I point to that construction worker.
Cop: So that absolutely is assault. That's verbal assault.
"Cody: This is real assault. They're taking cars and shit, and driving it like, construction vehicles and driving it around my fucking job, man. I'm just trying to do my job. [takes a drag]"
"Cop: Okay, this-- Sir, I don't need to know a thing about you--"
"Cody: So I’m allowed to have nunchucks, is what you're saying."
"Cop: Again, if you are transporting them to a martial arts studio where you are licensed and have the insurance for that, yes, absolutely."
"Cody: So, if I sign up for a fucking Tae Kwon Do class, I can just freak out with these weapons? Is that what you're telling me? Is that what’s allowed?"
Cop: You can never freak out with these weapons.
"Cody: Not that I would freak out, I'm fucking very controlled. [takes a drag]"
"Brennan: The cops— You see that the guy leans in and says,"
"Cop: Look man... I'm gonna let you off with a warning because frankly, I don't find you threatening. So."
[Emily laughs]
Cody: That’s fucking weird. Do you not find the devil threatening?
Ally: [laughing] You don’t find the devil— [doubles over in laughter]
"Brennan: But they say,"
Cop: You've got to get out of here.
"Brennan: And so they send you off packing. Go ahead and give me either Investigation, or give me Perception."
"Murph: Ooh, baby. That is a 19."
"Brennan: 19, hell yes. You know that there's a way to get into the Hot Topic, just not with this many people around. There's so much good shit left in there that didn't get moved back out, and you know that they're just gonna raze this place to the ground and junk all of that shit."
"Cody: If anyone touches those Jack Skellington hoodies, I'm gonna fucking freak out."
"Murph: And I just like, kick a Halloween decoration on the side of the road."
Lou covers his face.
Brennan: You just kick a full pumpkin that like a coffee shop had carved for their stoop.
[Emily laughs]
[1:41:54 - Kingston and Pete get lunch]
"Brennan: And you head home. As Cody marches back, knowing that you'll be able to return tonight to get those things, you know the way in. We zoom back over to the third story apartment of a beautiful family-owned building in Harlem, New York. As Kingston Brown awakes from his beautiful dream of himself as a younger man, because guess what baby, Kingston Brown, for about a year or more now… Actually, yeah, almost three years has been having lovely dreams at night, and remembering them on waking in the morning."
"Kingston, you awake to see the most beautiful woman in the world sitting on the bed with a giant mug of coffee placed next to you on the bedside table. She leans down and gives you a kiss. Liz is in her apartment uniform, which is— Liz wears very professional clothes to work. She's a lawyer. She works in city buildings and works with the city. So the moment she comes in the door at night, it is one of your oldest, softest, most threadbare T-shirts, and one of your oldest, most comfortable boxers, and that is what Liz wears in the apartment. That is the apartment uniform. It is a steady war of attrition as your old T-shirts move from your dresser to hers over the course of weeks."
"Kingston: You can’t be— hey, that's one of my favorite T-shirts, all right? That was the time… You know, my uncle got that for me from the Playboy jazz festival. You can't just take— You just can’t wear… you know, that’s..."
"Liz: This was at the bottom of your shirt drawer. Tell me, do you actually wear this? Do you actually wear this shirt?"
"Kingston: [stuttering] M-maybe. I don’t— No. No, I don't wear it. But, you know."
"Brennan: You see, she leans down, gives you a kiss on the cheek and says,"
"Liz: It's comfy, it's nice."
Kingston: Okay.
Liz: I promise—
"Kingston: Well, you look good in it."
"Brennan: You see, she winks at you and says,"
Liz: I know I look good in it.
"Brennan: And she walks out. You wake up— beautiful morning, that you're— you’re off in your living room, this is a classic old railroad apartment. You got like old vinyl playing in the morning. Liz came back with some of her furniture, you have a little like one of those small, marble top cafe tables, like the kind that you'd find in Paris, just like a little Parisian thing over by the window near the sunlight. Liz is sitting there having her coffee, old school, like reading a paper, newspaper. And lying down on the couch, next to you, is the most stately, comfy, sleepy, bulldog in the world, Bruce, who's right there next to you."
Lou: I go give Bruce a good old belly rub.
Bruce: [puts paws up in the air and pants]
Kingston: There he is. There he is.
Lou: And then like toss a toy across the room for him to go chase.
"Brennan: Bruce loves to play fetch, and he plays it at a glacial speed. The toy goes, he likes swivels his head, looks, gets up, shakes himself a little bit, moseys on down the couch to make it to the Ottoman. From the Ottoman, to a little sort of like a nice, folded blanket. Rolls off the blanket. Waddles his way over to the toy, grabs the toy. Kind of forgets where he came from. Remembers, goes back up with the toy to the couch, and plops it on the arm of the sofa in front of you."
"Kingston: You're perfect, you know that? You're perfect."
[Cast laughs]
Lou: And I go join Liz over at our Parisian table.
"Brennan: Those beautiful little… You can tell it was like one of those like stone and metal tables that was made for like an outdoor Alfresco kind of dining. But you guys have it here, beautiful seats. For like 40 minutes of your morning, there's an old vinyl of just some of the best jazz in the world playing. You guys drink these huge pots of coffee that are like— you have this old reliable coffee maker. Liz usually puts one or… She like mixes it up a little bit, this morning there's like a little dash of cinnamon in there. You see... life couldn't be more beautiful."
Lou: It's great.
"Brennan: Liz looks up at you and goes,"
"Liz: [yawns] All right, I better start thinking about getting to work. You know, I'm working on this case, and you know who's actually helping me out, who we’re pulling some evidence from is um…"
Kingston: Who is that?
"Liz: Well, it's your friend Kugrash's son, David, is actually..."
Kingston: Oh! Yeah.
"Liz: He's doing a lot of help. But looking after this thing, it's a whole Rico case right now. We’re lookin’-- you know, after Don Confetti and the whole thing, like finally, it's been years, but we’re actually, have the case ready to kind of dismantle that whole pixie organization."
"Kingston: Mafia, whole situation, yeah."
Liz: That’s right.
"Kingston: Okay, that's good, you know. I'm sure Kugrash is out there somewhere watching it all, very proud."
"Brennan: You see that she puts her hand over her heart and says,"
Liz: [kisses up to the sky] Thank you Kugrash for watching out for us.

"Brennan: She looks at you and says… [laughing] Aww, Murph doing hairy baby."
[Cast awws]
"Emily: I feel like I, as a player, have to roll one of my things..."
"Brennan: You see, she looks up at you. You got a relaxed morning ahead of you. You're not working until later today. She looks up and says,"
"Liz: All right, I'mma get ready to head to work, hun."
"Brennan: She looks and says,"
"Liz: Oh, by the way, because we're kind of gearing up, I actually have some depositions this Friday, so I'm gonna have to pass on that Islanders game I know that you got tickets for."
"Kingston: Oh, come on. I mean, it's okay. It's completely okay. I was looking forward to it, that's all."
"Liz: I know. We'll go, I promise. I have to miss the Islanders game so that we can go walking by the river on Sunday. That's sacrosanct, nothing's gonna touch that."
"Kingston: Okay, that’s what’s important, that's what's important."
Brennan: She gives you a kiss goodbye. Kingston's got a spare Islanders ticket for Friday that he's got to figure out what to do with.
"Lou: You know I'm hitting the phone. Let me text Pete real quick. Just,"
"Kingston: What's going down Friday? If you got the time, I got a spare ticket to go see New York's best team."
"Ally: I write back,"
"Pete: Oh, the Yankees?"
[Cast laughs]
Ally: Cause I'm fucking with you.
"Lou: Okay, good. Kingston gets truly like, viscerally upset."
Ally: And then I write a laughing emoji.
"Lou: I text back,"
Kingston: Hahahahahahaha.
Lou: Send.
"Kingston: Cool, so you're down?"
Pete: Yeah. I'm super down.
Kingston: Very cool. Let me know if you want to grab dinner or something beforehand. Liz's working long shifts this week. Would be great to see you.
"Ally: I say,"
"Pete: That sounds great, let's go to that Pupusa spot."
"Lou: Oh, I text back,"
Kingston: I love pupusas. Cannot wait for pupusas and the Islanders.
"Brennan: Yeah, I'll say. Pete, you're actually… You're near Kingston right now. It's like near lunchtime. If you wanted to grab pupusas now, you have a moment before you head out."
Pete: Dare I say we go grab some right now. What are you up to now?
Kingston: Hungry for pupusas.
"Ally: We get there, we get there."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Kingston: Headed downstairs, meet you at Cosmo’s."
"Lou: And I immediately toss on my coat over my comfortable sweater, and bound down the stairs, excited for pupusas."
"Ally: I quickly finish my sliders and throw the trash away, book it...."
Brennan: You bound down the stairs. You've also probably got… You gotta take Bruce for a walk before you had to work yourself.
"Lou: Oh, perfect."
"Brennan: Kingston, you hit the street. The music of the city comes to life, you walk in a synchronized heartbeat with those around you, your friends in the neighborhood all say hello to you as you pass by. The dogs of the neighborhood all nod to Bruce as Bruce passes by. You get to Cosmo’s, Cosmo goes,"
"Cosmo: Ay, Kingston Brown, man."
"Kingston: ‘Ey, what's up Cosmo? Can I get a tall black one just to kick the day off?"
"Cosmo: I like it my man, here you go."
"Brennan: Your coffee lands in front of you on the city's tab. Blam. Cosmo says,"
"Cosmo: Ay man, I got to say, thank you again for that and help with my lease man. Those renters, they were trying to rake me over the coals, I appreciate it."
"Kingston: Happy to do it. You know, hey, they gotta make money, it doesn't need to be at our suffering, all right? We can talk this out. There's always a conversation to be had, you know? Don't hesitate. Do not hesitate to ever call on me if you need me."
"Cosmo: Absolutely. Yeah, you got it Kingston, you got it."
"Brennan: You see that Pete joins you here as well. Pete, you show up, and there were probably some mixed emotions here because it's awesome to see Kingston again, but probably you haven't seen Kingston in a minute. Kingston has been kind of like, you know, with Liz and like living his own life for himself for the first time in literally forever."
"Ally: I give him a really big hug that lasts like, pretty long."
"Lou: And it's like right in front of the counter at Cosmo's, it's like a good hug that kind of takes over the entire entryway of the store. There's just a lot of like quiet, like,"
"Kingston: How’ve you been man? It's good to see, good to see you, man."
"Pete: Man, it's really good to see you."
"Kingston: It's so good to see you, man. It's been too… I'm sorry we haven't gotten this together sooner, all right? That's on me, all right? That's on me."
"Pete: Nah, don't worry about it. Really, don't worry about it. I've been busy, so yeah."
"Kingston: Yeah, yeah. Everything's good over at the bookshop?"
"Pete: Yeah, it's been great. Yeah, things are… Honestly, can I be honest with you? Things are a little slow, and I'm still getting used to that, you know? It's like I can just go to bed at like 10:30 at night, and get a full night's sleep. And that's not boring, that's normal."
Kingston: Yeah.
Pete: It’s not boring.
"Kingston: You're making a big shift, big shift from what your life used to be, to what your life is now, all right? And that takes some adjustment, that takes some growth. And growth is always gonna be uncomfortable because it's different."
"Pete: Yeah, yeah, it's true. It's so true."
"Kingston: Anyway, let's talk about it more over pupusas."
Pete: Let's do it!
Brennan: You two have a beautiful lunch of pupusas. Each of you guys give me an Insight check.
"Ally: Ooh. 20, but not nat."
Brennan: Cool.
Kingston: 25.
"Brennan: 25\. I think both of you can kind of see each other here. Like I think Pete is seeing… Like Pete ended up moving out of Kingston's place because Kingston was… his life was healing. He was going to get back together with Liz. And I think you see how truly well Kingston is doing. I think Kingston, you clock the little 60 days sober chip on Pete. And again, Ally, what do you think Kingston's seeing on Pete with a 25 Insight check?"
"Ally: I mean you're probably seeing that I'm really still trying to figure it out. I haven't quite gotten there, but I'm sure you're getting that vibe of like… you know, when people put on their most put together front for like their parents or something. So, you're really getting like the report card, like, “School's good, yeah” like, version of me."
Lou: Got it.
"Kingston: I don't want to get too personal, but did you— did you and Rowan, like, you know, like you know, do— do it. I don't wanna— I don’t wanna ask. I'm not trying to get all up in your business, you know? But, you know."
"Pete: No, I… Yeah, you know-- ah, god, it was so stupid. I was just having like a pretty hard time. And I'm just so used to meeting up with people not sober, you know? I pre-gamed it a little bit too hard and yeah, I think I just really like, embarrassed myself in front of her. Pretty much, I got there, I met some of her really cool theater friends, and then I barfed in what I thought was a potted plant, but was her lap. And then I started crying, and she kinda… I don't really know what happened after that, but I woke up at her house and she didn't talk to me, and I just kinda like, left."
"Kingston: Cool, yeah. That sounds really bad, just like rough."
"Pete: Yeah. I had like a little thin blanket put over me, so that was really nice of her to like, maybe tuck me in. But yeah… She— I— [shrugs]"
"Kingston: But you always know, if somebody's putting a thin blanket over you, it's because you did a bad thing."
"Pete: It's a sign, yeah. There were thicker blankets that she could have used."
"Kingston: Exactly. She could've given you a thicker blanket if it was in a positive light, but she wanted you to feel a little bit of that coldness. I hear that, that's rough. I'm— ‘ey, I've gotten a thin blanket before, all right? It happens to the best of us."
"Pete: Yeah. I mean, I get it. It was just a lot. And that's part of the journey is realizing when you're a lot. And not everybody wants to take care of you, especially if you just met, even if they are like, really hot."
[Brennan laughs]
Pete: She was so hot.
"Kingston: Uh huh, yeah. Well, hey man, you know, I'm sorry. You know I've been busy. You know, got the Liz and Bruce and just moving in and--"
"Pete: That sounds so great, man. How's it been? Has it been like—"
"Kingston: Incredible. I don't know, man. It's been weird. It’s been weird, I'm having my own confusing feelings about not being in the streets with you guys anymore, and not being out all hours of the night. You know? But things are good. We watch shows on Gladiator Prime and just kind of hang out."
Pete: Cool.
"Kingston: Like I was just sitting at this little table we got, and the light was shining in, and she just looked perfect. It was just like this moment where I was looking at her and I was just like, I don't want anything else. I want not right now. And I don't know, that's new, it's different."
"Pete: You deserve it, man. You really do."
"Kingston: Yeah, well, hey, and you're gonna get it, all right? [crosstalk] And you let me know if there is anything I could do to help."
"Pete: [crosstalk] [laughs] Yeah, right."
"Kingston: I don't know many like… I don't know if I can wingman you, I don't know if that's my vibe, but I’d try. I mean, I don't know if you want a 58 year old man, you know, hitting the clubs with you, but you know. We can figure something out."
"Pete: Hey, I'm gonna hold you to that. I'm gonna bring you to a club."
"Kingston: I mean, hey, you already made me get this tattoo. So, you know?"
Ally: [miming pulling up a short sleeve] We show off our tattoos.
"Lou: Yeah, I full on take my shirt up in the back."
"Kingston: This thing hurt like a mother, all right? You know, didn't tell me that. You didn't tell me how much it was gonna hurt. I'm still mad about that. [crosstalk] I'm creased."
"Pete: [crosstalk] Hey, I'm sorry."
"Brennan: Kingston and Pete have finished your wonderful pupusas. Kingston, you're gonna head back to drop Bruce off at home and get ready for an evening of work. Pete, you begin to head off, excited to see Kingston for the first time in a long time. As you head out on the subway… No, sorry, not even the subway. You grabbed the bus going down 125th street across the Triborough, that'll take you right to Astoria. You're like looking around at your phone. The last text you got from Rowan was a long, long time ago. She has kind of checked out of the Unsleeping City. She's mostly in Faerie now. Like she is a very different incarnation of the same being that Misty was, and has been like, hasn’t left the Faerie court that she created in a long, long time. And the faerie court is kind of thriving, it seems like she's thriving. And let me ask you a question here: Would Pete still follow Priya on any social media channels?"
[Emily gasps]
Ally nods.
[players laugh]
"Ally: Yeah, definitely."
Zac: The saddest nod.
"Brennan: You've been doing really well about not visiting her pages. So the algorithm has died down and has not shown you any of her stuff in a while. Her hand, superimposed over a beautiful white sand beach. A diamond ring around her finger, and an enormous, muscular hand warmly grasping hers alights at the top of your Instagram feed."
Ally: I immediately see if anything's tagged or who--
Brennan: The giant fucking hand is tagged.
Ally: I-- Is this a joke? Was she on Game Changer?
[Cast laughs]
Ally: Sorry.
"Brennan: Game Changer, only on Dropout."
"Ally: No, no. I go to the profile of muscular hand person."
"Brennan: The dude waiting for you on the other end of that link is a guy who is a woodland survival influencer. So he's got like an Instagram around living off of the land sustainably, but seems to be at a lot of like, openings and premieres for stuff. It's like a lot of brands associated with it. He is this huge, like a little… Like as broad shouldered and muscular as superhero actors, but still being very lean. All of his flannel shirts are fitted. He's got this like, cow catcher chin with a perfectly manicured stubble. He seems to make his living off of like, wilderness brands on his social media. He's got a tremendous amount of followers, verified."
Ally: Can I do some sort of roll to look through old tagged photos and see if he is cis?
Brennan: Give me an Investigation check.
"Ally: Yeah, that's huge. 23."
"Brennan: 23, you look through and see one of the rare moments in his early Instagram where he went off brand, there is a childhood photo of him, which is the best you're gonna get. But it appears that— at an early birthday party, like missing teeth, little kid photo, that you see “Happy Birthday Calvin” which is the name he's still going by today, up on a banner behind him."
Ally: I throw my phone on the bus.
[Cast laughs]
"Pete: Interesting! Sorry. Oh gosh. My hands are so sweaty. I'm so sorry, that slipped!"
"Brennan: To continue these rolls. And again, you're over Priya. But there's just… This is some kind of, some kind of thing..."
"Ally: Of fucking course, yeah. Huh."
"Brennan: You see that his most recent posts, other than a reshare of the post being like, “Priya Danger is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life.” The post right before that is him… It's like a branded thing where he's out on a felled log holding this drink called Cipher, which is Gladiator's branded, flavorless nutrition beverage. And him being like, “All the nutrients you need with none of the hassle”, you know?"
"Ally: Oh my God. I think they deserve each other. I think I'm trying my best to think like, “Good luck, you two.” But there is a part of me that's hurt by this."
"Brennan: If you have not already, this is one of Pete's triggers. Go ahead and roll that d4. And again for everyone at home—"
[Ally holds up two fingers]
"Emily: Ooh, good."
"Brennan: Two, okay, great. Good, good, good. For everyone at home, we'll put up the sobriety rule somewhere. The really dangerous roll is to roll a one on a d4 in terms of your sobriety because there are no other dice to go down to to maintain your sobriety."
"Ally: Yeah, and this is just… I'm able to work and bump myself up dice and invest in that, yeah."
Brennan: Yeah. But Pete's not in a great place right now.
"Ally: No, he's not! No, he's not, Brennan!"
"Brennan: Kingston, as you walk away from this meeting by the way, you're heading back to go to your spot, everything's good. And you're stopped short for a moment. There was a huge electronics spot on 125th Street. And a buddy of yours ran his electric shop. It's a fucking ghost town, it's empty. It's boarded up. You look at it, this dude, Reggie, you you've known for like 30 some odd years, like a long… Like before you were Vox Populi, you knew this dude. Plaster, spackle, painter's tape up, and it's just empty. It's just an empty store. It doesn't even have a for sale sign on it, it's just empty."
"Lou: Is it open, or is there like, the ability to see inside?"
"Brennan: You can see inside, it looks like they've had painters in here. But you go to open the door and the door can't open. I mean, it's locked. It's not that unusual that there'd be a locked door. But it seemed like it happened fucking overnight, this place is gone."
"Lou: I text Reggie and just,"
"Kingston: Hey, walked past the shop, seems like rough business. So sorry to hear that, please let me know if there's anything I can do to help."
"Brennan: You get a text back from Reggie that says… You get a text back from him real quick that says,"
"Reggie: What, if anything, stays?"
[a long pause]
Lou: Just that?
"Brennan: Just that. You were mistaken. You saw something that, for a moment, you thought you saw that, but it’s not there. There's an ellipsis, he says,"
Reggie: Hey man.
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Reggie: All's well, got a huge offer to buy me out of the building. A lot of money. They're going to put a new, some phone company, some kind of front up there. Not sure exactly what."
"Brennan: But he says,"
"Reggie: Sorry for the neighborhood shop to go. But it’s enough money that I’m thinking of getting a spot, probably up in Westchester somewhere. Sorry to not say goodbye before I headed out from the neighborhood."
Kingston: Sorry to see you go. Don't spend it all in one place. Laugh Out Loud.
Ally: Written out?
"Lou: Written out fully capital L, capital O, capital L"
[2:07:10 - Pete’s new apartment]
"Brennan: Yeah, and Kingston walks back to drop Bruce back off at the apartment. Pete arrives in Astoria at the spot you're looking at. The spot you found here is a very small room in a house in Astoria. You'd actually be staying in a house out here. It's an upstairs room, it's like an attic. You found it for $750 a month."
"Ally: Wow, amazing."
"Brennan: So, you arrive at the house to take a look at it. House opens up. This young, skinny looking dude, Arab-American guy, glasses, kind of a little poof of hair on top, wearing pastel blue T-shirt, goes up. He goes,"
"Dude: Hey, how's it going? Pete, right?"
"Pete: Yeah, hey, what's up?"
"Dude: Hey, Nasir, nice to meet you, man. Come on in and take a look at the spot. I'm going to give you… Not every roommate is home right now, so I can’t show you every single spot, but I can show you your spot and kind of where we're at. Thanks for coming out, man. You would complete the puzzle here."
"Pete: Hey yeah, good to hear. I'm really looking for a spot. This place is really nice. A house!"
"Nasir: It's not bad, right? I mean, yeah. I mean, when it like, when it snows, it's like more than a 20 minute walk to the subway or the nearest bus. But, y’know, hey, y’know walking's good for your legs. So check it out."
"Brennan: You see that he brings you through, he introduces you to a couple other roommates. You get a sense that Nasir is like the guy on the lease. He says,"
"Nasir: This is my work station out here, which is sort of-- I know it’s in a public, shared area but it's just ‘cause that's where it it's helpful for internet speed. And also, just like my room is kind of small. I pay..."
Pete: What do you do?
"Nasir: I'm a web designer, so I work from home. Here, I'm like working here in the living room a lot, but I do pay more. I’m not like screwing you guys out of that money."
"Pete: Okay, cool."
"Nasir: Check it out, we got a couple other people. This is Josh."
"Brennan: You see in the living room, there's just like a curtain. This young dude, Josh Mendoza, walks out. He looks over at you and goes like,"
"Josh: Oh, hey, man. Are you coming and looking out for the attic room?"
Pete: Yeah.
"Josh: Hell yeah, dude. I'm Josh, nice to meet you, man."
"Pete: Good to meet you, too."
"Brennan: He looks over and says,"
Josh: Have you introduced him...?
"Brennan: Nasir goes,"
"Nasir: So there's a couple that lives here in one of the other rooms. They do, again, pay more than just their room would be. Their names are Lars and Brita. They... [a pause] have a lot of guests over."
"Pete: Uh huh. Like they're just really like, they have a lot of friends?"
Nasir: They don't really have parties. They sort of bring a lot of guests back to their room. So that's kind of something that's going on here.
"Pete: Ooh! Oh! Oh, yeah."
Nasir: Hell yeah. There's one other--
Pete: Okay.
"Nasir: Yeah, for sure."
"Pete: Like sex, right?"
"Brennan: You see, they look at each other. And Josh looks at you and is like,"
"Josh: [laughs] Yeah, it's sex. They do have a lot of sex in there."
"Pete: Ok, cool, cool. Great. I'm working on being straightforward in my life. So yeah, cool."
"Brennan: You see Nasir looks at you and says,"
"Nasir: Yeah, but they're chill. There's one other dude that lives here that actually lives in sort of the cutoff part with Josh--"
"Brennan: And Josh goes,"
Josh: He's super rad and super friendly. He's like my best friend.
"Brennan: The door opens, Murph, your character walks in."
Cody: Fuck!
Murph: And I punch the wall.
Cody: They took my Buster sword.
"Pete: [shocked and confused] I'm sorry, man."
Cody: Thank you.
Pete: Who's they? Like— Is—
"Cody: The cops, freaking Gladiator’s taking over the mall. You heard the mall closed down, right?"
"Pete: No, there was a mall?"
Cody: [offended] [throws his hands up] I'm going to my room.
[Brennan laughs]
Murph: And I start to walk away.
"Pete: Wait, sorry, no, I just don't do a lot of shopping! I do a lot of used-- I like to hunt the bins."
"Brennan: You see that Josh leans over and says,"
"Josh: Um. Yeah, the mall got shut down, and that… that's Cody. I worked at the PacSun, and Cody worked over at the um… Hot Topic."
Pete: [in sync with Josh] Hot Topic?
"Brennan: [laughs] He goes,"
Josh: And we both kind of landed up here. So we kind of split… We're actually planning on getting some plywood in here and kind of actually partitioning this chunk of the living room off.
Cody: And we're going to hang like… We've got like a Soul Edge. Have you ever played the game Soul Calibur?
"Pete: Yeah, yeah, actually."
Cody: Yeah. So we're just going to put that like right front and center.
"Pete: What? Just like a poster, or...?"
"Cody: No, like a sword, dude."
"Pete: Oh, for sure, yeah. You're a big sword guy."
"Cody: Are you interviewing, are you like here for the room, or...? [takes a drag]"
"Pete: Yeah, I'm Pete, what's up?"
"Cody: Cool, what's up? Night Angel. Listen, how do you feel about… Because this is a point of contention and I could use somebody on my side. How do you feel about mounted scythes in shared living spaces? [takes a drag]"
"Brennan: You see Nasir actually says,"
"Nasir: Actually, we don't need to ask Pete about that because that actually, it has already been a house vote."
"Cody: But there would be a new one if Pete moved in, would there not be?"
Nasir: Right. So—
Cody: ‘Cause Josh is on my side.
"Nasir: Okay, yes. I know that Josh…"
"Brennan: You see Josh goes,"
"Josh: Always, dude, mall for life."
"Brennan: You see that Nasir goes,"
"Nasir: Cool. So we're not gonna do that, pretty much."
Cody: This is what it's like to live here. [takes a drag] [crosstalk] He’s got his desk out here.
"Pete: [crosstalk] Honestly, I welcome the energy. This is fun."
"Nasir: Hey man, Pete, actually, I'm gonna head out with you in one sec."
"Brennan: You see Nasir gets really close to you, Cody. It's like,"
"Nasir: For real dude, I'm just gonna say it again, you cannot smoke in here. If you want to go into your room where you pay rent and you want to smoke in there… And I still actually sort of demand, because I am on the lease, so you need to open the window to be able to do that."
"Cody: Cool, there’s actually-- we're gonna have a house vote cause there's actually no working out in the shared living spaces either. So you can go in your room if you want to like, do your job or whatever cause I'm just trying to do mine. [takes a drag]"
"Nasir: Listen, I pay more for the shared workspace..."
"Brennan: So, Pete, you see this kind of unfold."
"Ally: I'm trying really hard to not laugh and just be like, really invested like, [nods] whoa, this is, yeah, important convo."
"Brennan: So Pete, but yeah, you do see the spot. The attic room's not bad. It'll be hot, it would be hot as hell during the summer, but it's October right now, and it's kind of not a bad place to crash for a little while. And it's a sublet, so it's totally month to month. Like it's an illegal sublet. So you're..."
Ally: Speaking my language!
[2:14:39 - Cody sneaks into the Mall]
"Brennan: Cool. You and Nasir work that stuff back out. Cody, you head off to the mall that night. And go ahead and give me a Stealth check, if you'd be so kind."
"Murph: [laughing] Cody's not that stealthy, let's see."
[Siobhan laughs]
Ally: You brought an even bigger sword.
"Murph: Yeah, he’s got…"
"Siobhan: Clank, clank."
"Murph: Oh, actually my stealth is okay. Ooh, 23."
Brennan: Woah!
"Murph: Naruto running, jumping between each foot."
"Siobhan: Parkour, parkour, parkour."
"Brennan: You fucking Night Angel your way into the empty mall. You are back. The tiles where once Taco Bell was consumed and happy, happy shoppers moved to and fro all of their favorite stores brought into one central location. You see the Hot Topic before you."
Murph: I take my Soul Edge from my back.
Lou: Oh my god.
Murph: I put it down and I take a knee. [a pause as he bows his head] I put it back on and I enter the Hot Topic.
"Brennan: You still have your manager key from your many years of managing this Hot Topic. You open the gate, push it up, move through, there’s still so many treasures in here worth saving. Hopefully tonight, you can get like a couple loads done. But what do you go to grab first?"
"Murph: You gotta go Breaking Benjamin, P.O.D. posters, all the pro wrestling T-shirts, Adventure Time sort of hats and whatnot."
"Ally: [drinking water, then they laugh] Mmhm!"
Murph: Studded belts.
Ally holds their nose as they try to swallow the water.
"Brennan: Under the studded belts, and some of the wrestling tees--"
"[The cast laughs as Ally continues to try and recover, they cough]"
Siobhan: We broke Ally.
[Zac imitates the noise Ally made]
Murph: This is from a very-- Cody is from a very particular time. I don't think Hot Topic has most of these things anymore.
Ally: The Adventure Time hat sold me.
"Brennan: You are scrounging around underneath some of the wrestling tees. You grab something, it looks like a giant nov— one of your giant novelty wallets. It's like this crazy infernal kind of devil-looking book. Do you guys sell some of these that have secret compartments where you're hold a whiskey flask or something like that? As you flip through this, it's just a straight up book. It also doesn't smell rad. It doesn't smell like Axe, or some of these would be like, kind of like cologne or whatever. It smells like nasty, rotten, old meat. It is a bad smelling book. But the production quality of it is incredible. It's like some of the pages are stitched into the binding with leather cords and shit. There's like nasty ass old runes and stuff."
"Murph: I think Cody is just looking for rad stuff. Just as soon as he sees the... He skips over all of the words. When he sees the runes, he's like,"
"Cody: Fucking hell yeah, dude."
"Murph: And just like looks for the weirdest, most occult stuff in it."
Zac: You think it's Evil Dead merch?
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: You find some occult stuff. Also give me a Perception check with disadvantage.
Murph: I have a -1 Wisdom.
Brennan: Oh no.
Murph: That is a nat 1.
[Brennan claps]
Emily: It becomes a 0. [laughs]
Brennan: I'm gonna tell you all the things that Cody doesn't notice. Cody doesn't notice the motes of red light that bubble up from the ground where this book was laying.
[Murph mimes obliviously paging through the book]
"Brennan: Nor does he notice the strange pentagram that kind of unseals, almost as if an orifice of some other hidden world had just finished belching this book out into the bottom of this Hot Topic. Cody doesn't notice any of this. You just notice the page that finally has like high Gothic script Latin that you actually think you'd be able to read."
"Murph: Hell yeah, I read it."
"Brennan: As you read it out loud to sound out the Latin, [makes explosion noise] the book erupts in flame as a pentagram surrounds you. The book slams to the ground, and a column of fire belches out from it. As it does, you see the fire is flickering. And you see momentary beads of neon light cutting into it and see movements of light coming along these pathways, almost like cars traveling on highways. And you hear motors, and the motors are like fucking with the infernal flame. It's almost like these like highways made of light constrict and bind. [makes crackling demonic noises] And you see something crawling up out of the flame going,"
Voice: [demonic growling] Who dares summon me? Give me a fucking hand. Give me a hand!
"Murph: I think Cody is like, looking like, just… ‘Cause they have a lot of rad shit. So he just assumes this is some kind of crazy smoke machine thing. So he's just looking at how the book works. He's like,"
"Cody: This fucking rules, what the f— [reaches a hand out] My name is uh, Night Angel. AKA Cody, I guess."
"Brennan: You grab a hand. You rip this being out of the flame and those highways of light, sort of runic highways vanish. The fire dissipates, and a four and a half foot tall devil appears before you standing on the book-- I will try to describe this as best I can. Four and a half feet tall is a horned… The head of a marmot. So a like, marmot-headed hamster-y or guinea pig-y kind of face with curling ram's horns. About the size of a human head. On an extremely weak, humanoid, hairless torso with long clawed hands. But then at the waist of the torso, it is a full four-legged capybara body with a long rat tail. So it's kind of like a centaur rat tail with marmot head. And then a pair of vestigial wings on its torso's back. And you see that this devil goes,"
"Devil: [very raspy] Ah! Holy fucking shit dude, what the fuck?"
"Cody: Dude, what the fuck?"
Devil: What the fuck? Where am I?
"Cody: Are you… you're in… [chuckles] You're home. [takes a drag] It's where darkness is born, this is Hot Topic. Are you Lucifer? ‘Cause I've been fucking waiting for you my whole life."
"Brennan: You see, this devil looks at you and says--"
[Cast laughs]
"Zac: “Are you Lucifer, because I've been waiting for you my whole--” [laughs]"
"Brennan: You see that the devil goes,"
"Devil: [hesitantly] Uh. Okay, yeah. I'm Lucifer, I'm the real devil."
"Cody: [nodding] That-- I mean, yeah."
"Devil: Okay, so this is the real world. You're a human mortal, I'm the devil."
[Lou laughs]
"Devil: I'm not asking these as questions, I'm saying this. This is all— This is true. Okay, holy shit! Ah, the mortal world. Okay, what...? Oh. Mortal! Answer this riddle! What city are we in?"
Cody: City of sin.
Devil: Las Vegas?
[Emily laughs]
"Cody: No, the other city of sin. It's fucked up here. [takes a drag]"
"Devil: [excited] Oh, we're in New— [crosstalk] [gasps] We’re in New—"
"Cody: [crosstalk] Please, let me work for you. Please."
Devil: You wanna work for me?
"Cody: Please, let me work for you. Lucifer, please. We need to kill Gladiator and save the Mall, and I will sell my soul just in a second. Take my soul."
Devil: [chuckling] Ho-ho-holy shit. You just broached that topic. I didn't have to like set anything up.
"Cody: Just take whatever-- do I need to like, give blood, or...?"
"Devil: Yeah, blood's great. Yeah, shit. Okay, hold on. Do you have something we can--"
"Murph: I just like Andrew W.K. it, [laughing] and I just start like, grab a brick or something and just."
Cody: [hitting his forehead] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
"Devil: [waving his hands] No! Dude, no! Shut up! Stop! No, listen! Do you have something to write on? Something blank that we can write on?"
"Cody: Yeah, I found this weird fucking book that you came out of that I can--"
"Devil: Not that, not the book. How about this?"
"Brennan: You see, he goes and grabs a WWE poster and unfurls it."
"Cody: Whoa! Dude— Oh wait, okay. It's Roman Reigns, it's fine. [takes a drag]"
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: [laughs] Just on the back of a Roman Reigns poster, he goes,"
"Devil: Okay, [writing] in exchange for working-- For the privilege of working for me, you will sell me your soul, full deal."
[Lou laughs]
"Cody: Well, you need to give me like powers and shit, man. Like you have to like fucking kill… [crosstalk] We have to get rid of..."
"Devil: [crosstalk] Yes, powers, powers, powers."
Cody: We have to get the mall back.
"Devil: I will give you powers, great, great, great."
"Brennan: You see, he says,"
Devil: Hold out your hand.
"Cody: Okay, just, I have to be able to like, freak out and be strong."
"Devil: You got it, pinprick of blood. You're good."
Murph: I just give my hand.
"Brennan: You see, pricks your finger and says,"
"Devil: All right, now put it on the dotted line."
"Brennan: It's just like some Sharpie dots that he just put on the back of this poster. He’s like, he’s using his hooves to keep it from rolling up."
"Cody: All right Lucifer, I sell my soul to you."
"Murph: I write— [laughs] at first, I write “Night Angel”. And then I realized that it might be binding, and then I change it to “Cody”."
"Brennan: You do it. You see, he goes,"
Devil: Great. I'm gonna sign my name as Bazathrax. Don't worry about that.
"Brennan: And then you see, signs “Bazathrax” on the line. He goes, fwah! It turns into fire. He goes,"
"Bazathrax: Holy shit, I can feel it. There’s no— The infernal realms can't reach here. There's some kind of hex preventing them from… Cody— sorry, Night Angel— we could do a lot of good work here, man. It's wide open field, baby. There's no one else doing what we're doing in town right now."
"Cody: [nodding] Let's bring the flames of hell to raze Gladiator, and from the ashes, the mall will grow."
"Bazathrax: Hell yes. Great, good job. I'll always know where you are. Just say my name."
"Cody: So, Lucifer, are we… So now that we're working together, are we just gonna get like a bunch of your fallen angels and we're just gonna go like kick those construction guys’ asses, or what?"
"Bazathrax: Cool. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run a little bit of recon, and I'm gonna get back to you about all these plans, okay? What you should do for right now—"
"Cody: You are Lucifer, right? Just to—"
"Bazathrax: 100% dude, 100%. Would never lie to you about that. I am the person you mentioned. But, like— Like you know how you go by Night Angel, right?"
Cody: Yeah.
"Bazathrax: So, that's like a code name, right? So Lucifer is a very powerful name. And so, we're gonna go by my [finger quotes] “code name”, which is Bazathrax, okay? [holding hands up on each side of his mouth] It's a secret name only you— [gets very close to the camera] only you and me know about."
"Cody: Bazathrax, I got it."
"Bazathrax: Okay? Great. You go home, I'm gonna do— I'mma some snooping, but— you got all kinds of powers now, don't even worry about it, okay?"
"Cody: Um. All right, Bazathrax."
"Brennan: You feel filled with infernal might. And Pete, you sign on that apartment. You're free to move in whenever you want. You can..."
Ally: I Venmo immediately.
"Brennan: Cool, you Venmo immediately. You roll in with like an air mattress that night. And you see Cody come home, and your Vox Phantasma shit goes wild. That guy wasn't part of the Unsleeping City when he left, and has come back part of it now."
Ally: Can I summon my lime green butterfly?
Brennan: Yes. [twirls hands] Butterfly appears.
"Pete: Hey, what's up man?"
"Cody: Oh, hey, um. What's up? So you moved in?"
Pete: Yeah. [a pause as he moves the butterfly between his hands]
Cody: Do you work…
Murph: Cody looks in both directions.
Cody: [quietly] Do you work for Lucifer too?
Pete: Do you work for Lucifer?
Cody: You're doing cool shit. Do you work for hell?
Ally: Can I do some sort of check to see what the the fuck is going on?
Brennan: Give me an Insight check.
"Ally: All right, 19."
Brennan: This dude has sold his soul in the last 45 minutes.
"Pete: Hey man, what just happened to you? What? You— Are you okay?"
"Cody: I'm better than I've ever been. Listen, we should go up to the attic because technically I wasn't supposed to ever say “Lucifer” to anybody, and I said it to the first person I saw. [Cast laughs] And the walls are thin here, [crosstalk] and my bedroom is a sheet, Josh— Josh is just here."
"Pete: [crosstalk] Yeah, come on up, come on up. Yeah."
Ally: We go up to my room.
[2:29:24 - Iga’s chest]
"Brennan: You guys head upstairs. Iga, what's Iga doing at home as your daughter Jessica— You see that your husband, Oskar, comes in and goes,"
"Oskar: [slight Polish accent] Okay, the girls, they are downstairs, and you know, they are watching a movie, having a good time."
Iga: Okay. You don't think I should go down there?
"Oskar: It's just, you can if you want. Actually, I might go see about— see why the pizzas are not here yet. They asked for some blankets and stuff like that maybe. Do we have some up in the upstairs, maybe?"
"Iga: Yeah, no. Yeah, absolutely, we got blankets. They didn't bring their own blankets though? What's their parents doing? Isn't that what you do when you go to the sleepover, you go to somebody else's house, you bring your blankets? I'll get them blankets."
"Oskar: Sarah only brought the sleeping bag, it’s not as fun. She cannot make a tent."
"Iga: Ohh, okay, okay, they're making tents."
Brennan: You head upstairs to your bedroom. What does Iga and Oskar's apartment look like?
"Siobhan: There's a lot of wood. It looked like it was decorated really nice in like, 1979. So there's like a lot of floral carpets, and everything is really well kept, but old. A lot of mismatched prints. The bed has handmade quilts on it. Like, it's a lot of sturdy furniture that's built to last."
"Brennan: Hell yes. You go up, grab some blankets. You pick them up off of a very old wooden chest in the corner of your room. As you pick them up, you see the chest almost has like, lichen or moss growing on it, ancient rusted metal. The chest is carved with thick trees, and a heavy latch on the front as it sits in the corner of your bedroom. You bring the blankets and stuff downstairs. You see, Sarah says,"
Sarah: Thanks Mrs. Lisowski.
"Brennan: You hear Dana, another friend of one of the girls over in the corner whisper over and go."
"Dana: [whispering] I wanna as— Let me ask, yes. [normal] Mrs. Lisowski, what is a borscht bite?"
"Brennan: And you see Jessica looks over and goes,"
"Jessica: [agonizingly] Guys, no. No."
"Iga: A borscht bite’s— it's delicious. You take a little round of sheep's cheese, and then the pickled beets, you chop them very, very small. And then you roll the sheep's cheese in the pickled beets..."
"Brennan: You see another girl goes,"
Girl: Sheep's cheese?
Iga: It's delicious. It's very good. It's traditional.
"Brennan: You see, Jessica says,"
"Jessica: Thanks, Mom. Thank you."
"Iga: [holds hands up] Enjoy your high sugar treats. I’m not in— I'm not interrupting, I'm not interrupting."
Brennan: You get back upstairs. The chest... is askew.
"Iga: Oh. Spirits, what are you doing? Are you messing around my bedroom?"
Ally: [laughs] So unfazed.
Brennan: You see that the wooden trees carved into the chest sway in the wind.
[dreamlike music]
"Iga: Oh boy. Oh boy, okay. Misiek!"
"Brennan: Crawling out from behind the bed is what to the world looks like a Chihuahua, but is actually an incredibly tiny, very old, oh-so-sick little dragon."
Misiek: [coughs and moans]
Brennan: Misiek flies up onto your shoulder.
Iga: How are you doing my little Misiek?
"Misiek: [pants, then coughs]"
"Iga: Ah, so good."
Siobhan: I give him like a tiny little… I have like a little strip of jerky that I give him.
Misiek: [eats noisily]
"Iga: Misiek, what is with this box? You've seen this box before doing this thing?"
"Brennan: You see that Misiek looks down, the trees sway. Misiek raises his back up into an arch and leaps to the bed and starts whining at you."
Misiek: [whimpers]
"Siobhan: Oh, I pick up Misiek."
"Brennan: He scrambles away and goes under your pillow, and is whining for you to like come to him."
"Siobhan: Okay, I do that."
"Brennan: As you approach, you see that the chest collapses and shrinks in size with a violent jerk and re-expands. You see that it warps, and you are seeing the space of the room warp around you. Distances between the walls and the corners of the room are shifting."
Iga: Hello?
"Brennan: The trees begin to fade, almost like something is trying to make the chest smooth. And you see the box snaps back out and roots and leaves slam out from the chest into your walls and floor. And the chest starts thudding violently into the floor and ceiling. [quickly waving his arm up and down] Bam-bam-bam, bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam! Light starts to emit, thick green light emitting out from the seam of the chest."
"Siobhan: Okay, can I try and like settle it down?"
Brennan: You can leap on it and try to rodeo this bad boy.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'll try and do that."
"Brennan: You leap on it. You hear from downstairs like,"
"Jessica: Mom, we're trying to watch a movie."
[Brennan makes more thumping noises]
"Iga: It's okay, don't worry about it. It's just the, uh— it’s the neighbors."
"Brennan: [laughs] You hear from next door,"
"Neighbor: Liar, it is not the neighbors. You are the one banging."
"Iga: It is you, you are wearing your shoes inside again. We talked about this."
"Brennan: [thumping noises] You hear something from inside the chest going [scary demonic noises] Looks like something's trying to wrench the chest open. The light turns to dark green, purple, gold, indigo, violet, spill out from the chest. Momentarily, the light becomes gray. As it flickers, you hear the buzzing and zapping of fluorescent lights. [more thumping] And FWOOM. The chest slams down. You hear cracking coming from inside the chest, and you see the magic of the chest flickering. A chest that has belonged to your family for more generations than you can count."
"Iga: Okay, well, this is new. This is a new thing. It's a new thing. What do we do?"
Siobhan: Can I do like an Arcana check?
Brennan: Give me an Arcana check.
"Siobhan: Ooh, a nat 20."
Brennan: Holy shit.
Ally: Ooh!
Lou: There you go.
"Brennan: Iga, you are a resilient woman. You are tied to the earth. You, like someone wrestling a rodeo steer to the ground, wrestle this chest to the ground, and to grow some roots of your own as you slam it down. You slam it shut, close it. The light seals. You can feel that whatever was trying to break inside, hasn't broken. Something was coming for it, but it didn't get to it. As you step away from the chest that has been covered in trees for centuries... you look and see, at the corners, at the edge of the forest are ancient Polish wood carvings... of skyscrapers. Set into the wood of the chest."
"Iga: Oh now what are these buildings doing here? No, okay. What? See, I don't like it when they look new, but they look like they've been there for hundreds of years. This is not a good sign for me, okay. Blah. Misiek!"
Misiek: [whimpers]
Iga: What is it?
"Brennan: Misiek flies over, looks at the buildings. And you see on top of one of the buildings is a woman very familiar to you and another man that you maybe have not seen. You do not recognize Ricky Matsui on top of that skyscraper, but you do recognize Sofia Lee. And that's all for this episode."
Emily: What!?
"Brennan: We're not even gonna get to the battle, gang. We'll pick that up next time. That is where we are going to leave off for this first episode of The Unsleeping City season two."
Ally: [scoffs] What?
Brennan: Hell yeah.

(Unsleeping City music)
"Brennan: Hello, one and all, and welcome back to another thrilling episode of ""Dimension 20: The Unsleeping City"". I'm your humble dungeon master Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me, as always, are our Intrepid Heroes. Say ""hi,"" Intrepid Heroes!"
"All: Hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"Brennan: Lovely, incredible, wonderful. Last we left them off, the champions of New York City were in the midst of a lovely October day. The day before Halloween, wherein we saw Sofia Lee living with her mother above Spaghetti's Bakery, heading out to her psychic. A new character that we're meeting for the first time, Ms. Iga Lisowski who runs a little illicit money laundering slash psychic operation out of the Upper West Side as Madam Anastasia. We also saw Pete the Plug working at a bookstore, looking for a new spot to live, get- together for pupusas with the wonderful Kingston Brown, living with Liz back in their spot together. And also saw a little flashback to Kingston's earlier days back in the early 90s. We saw Ricky Matsui in a clock tower loft with the wonderful Esther Sinclair, living a wonderful life heading off to work at the homeless outreach shelter. And also met Cody AKA the Night Angel Walsh, mall lifer and now infernal paladin of [finger quotes] ""Lucifer"" who is just going by Bazathrax."
"Emily: I wore a demon necklace for you, Cody."
Murph: I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
"Brennan: We saw a day in the life of our wonderful and familiar heroes, some emotional turmoil here and there, some engagements announced over Instagram, some fights over underwear, nothing too far."
Emily: [wheezes] Delicates.
"Brennan: Delicates. Your delicates, exactly. And an Islanders ticket that needed to go to a friend. We also saw the summoning of a devil into the slated for demolition Queens Center Mall, soon to become a Gladiator shipping and fulfillment campus, bringing tons of jobs and new buildings and a wonderful state-of-the-art campus to Queens, New York, along with a strange relationship with an arcane chest in the bedroom of Ms. Iga Lisowski in Greenpoint and a changing of a chest that has been unchanged previously for some hundreds of years."
[2:26 - Ricky at Helping Hands]
"Brennan: We return now to the Unsleeping City where that same day, we see Ricky Matsui working his heart out at the Helping Hands Homeless Outreach Center. What kind of work is Ricky getting up to today at Helping Hands?"
"Zac: Oh, man. Well, I think Ricky has recently watched a lot of YouTube videos on organization and is trying to organize like hygiene kits as best as possible, and just like really knocking out a ton of kits."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Ricky is getting these kits good to go.
Zac: Nice. Doing it.
"Brennan: You're doing it. Tasha Keane, who is the director here at Helping Hands comes in and goes,"
"Tasha: Oh, look at this. All these ducks in a row. My goodness, Ricky, you are a gem. What a hero."
"Brennan: She pats you on the shoulder, and mentions, she says,"
"Tasha: Oh, by the way, Rusty is here and would like to say hello to Ox if you get a chance to."
"Ricky: Oh, yeah. Of course."
Zac: Is— I feel like... is Ox inside? Can he be in with...
"Brennan: Ox? Yes, he's a super well— I think that you have like support dog qualifications for him."
Zac: Mhm. He's hypoallergenic. He can't be allergic to this animal I summoned.
[Cast laughs]
"Brennan: Exactly. Rusty comes in. Rusty's an old fellow. He's by here a lot and is very sweet to specifically Ox, but you look up as he comes in, and he looks up and says,"
"Rusty: Hey, look at that. There's Rick the Man. How's it going, Rick the Man?"
"Ricky: It's going pretty good, Rust the Man. How are you?"
"Rusty: [laughs] I'm better now that I got this boy here. Look at this guy. Come on, you bud."
"Zac: I mean, I hope that Ox is not being manhandled too much by an old man, but it seems like they have a good relationship, I imagine."
"Brennan: Yeah, he's being very sweet to him. You see that Rusty looks up and says,"
"Rusty: Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been around too long to say hi to the fellow. I've been busy, busy. I'm glad to see this fellow. You're looking good, Rick. How're you doing, Rick?"
"Ricky: I'm feeling good, you know, I just made a bunch of kits here, and, you know, I feel like I got my routine in order. You know, I got no complaints. How are you doing, Rusty?"
"Rusty: Good. Coming by-- coming by, you know, come by to help. I'm gonna help out a little bit, gonna get a bite to eat, but you know, it's all good. I'm glad to see you and the dog are good here, and I tell you, it's wild out there, you know?"
Rusty stares off very intently.
"Ricky: Yeah, yeah, I think I know what you mean, but if you... [he notices Rusty staring] Rusty, are you okay? You just..."
Rusty: Huh?
Ricky: You sorta stared at the ground pretty hard.
"Rusty: Nah, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. [Brennan gets very close to the camera] There used to be a rat."
[a pause]
Ricky: What? You used to be a rat?
"Rusty: [Brennan returns to his seat] No, no, there used to be. He would come around, you know? I remember sometimes, you know, having a hard time getting myself here."
Ricky: And a rat would show up.
Rusty: A rat would show up and help me out.
"Ricky: Hey, Rusty? There did used to be a rat."
Rusty: What?
"Ricky: There was a rat. And it was huge, and it was gross, and it would help people. That's real. Rusty, that's real."
[Murph and Emily laugh]
"Brennan: You see, down the hall, Tasha kind of turns her head. She's not fully listening, but she just turns to see Ricky talking to Rusty. He goes,"
Rusty: I knew it. [taps forehead then points at the camera]
Ricky: Yeah.
Rusty: I knew it.
"Ricky: That's not a thing you made up. I just want you to know 'cause I've seen that rat, and I think he's... I think the rat's gone now, but I think, you know, other people will help in his place."
"Brennan: You see, Rusty smiles and gives you a sort of ginger but warm embrace and says,"
Rusty: I know they will. They're doing it right now. They're doing it right now. Hey.
Brennan: He gives you a little punch in the arm.
"Ricky: Ow, so strong, dude."
Rusty: [laughs] Troublemaker. We got a troublemaker here.
[Lou laughs]
"Zac: I get Ox to do a backflip, I dunno."
Brennan: [woof!] Does a backflip.
Emily: [laughing] What?
Brennan: How late does Ricky tend to work at Helping Hands?
"Zac: I think he helps close up whatever the like, hour is that happens."
"Brennan: Cool. Rusty stays for a little while to help close up. Rusty is one of a couple of people at Helping Hands who both use the services here and also donate and volunteer their time here, and you have a lovely day making a tangible difference in the lives of people who need it. It's later at night. Sofia, after meeting up with Iga for that card reading, what does Sofia get up to that day?"
[8:34 - Sofia on the rooftops]
Emily: Wow.
Brennan: Or I should say into the night. I should say.
"Emily: I mean... Sofia's a little shook by the description of “you can't fall in love, you're falling off of a tower”. So I think Sofia is like,"
"Sofia: Okay, if my present is falling off a tower, I'll go climb some towers. I'll do a little falling and catch myself."
"[adventurous, dark orchestral music fades in]"
"Emily: So I climb some skyscrapers. [laughs] But I'm also keeping an eye out for any trouble because part of not drinking is... excruciating boredom, and so a little adrenaline rush from getting into a scrap with someone who deserves it is perhaps acting as a substitute."
"Brennan: Copy that. Go ahead and make a Perception check for me. This is if Sofia gets lucky, and if Sofia is really looking for a scrap, you can add an Investigation roll there as well."
Emily: She's really looking-- I got an 18 for Perception and a 10 for Investigation.
"Brennan: Cool. You climb up some skyscrapers. What, I guess, you..."
"Emily: Scaffolding, fire escapes, window washer units."
"Brennan: [laughs] You're just standing up on the precipice of a skyscraper looking out. You're kind of like near the Manhattan Bridge on the Brooklyn side. You're partway home to Staten Island before you get home, and the sun is setting. Gazing out over the city, you look... yeah, and there's just something about jumping from roof to roof of these tall buildings where the moment that you are in motion, and all you can do is anticipate landing and rolling into the next leap, there is a gleeful surrender of having to think about or do anything other than jump, and you're leaping from place to place. As you do so with that 18 Perception, you see sort of early night. You're a little bit closer to like the Clinton Hill area. You see there's some trees lining the street. There's some sort of dining areas out here. There's some bars. You see that there is a couple outside of a bar kind of engaged in a... it's just an argument, but man, are they being nasty to each other."
"Emily: Okay. I suppose out of curiosity, this could be almost like a reality show. I suppose I... Is there like an area of darkness near them?"
"Brennan: Yeah, there's an area of darkness nearby."
"Emily: Okay. I'm a Shadow monk now, so I teleport to that area of darkness to eavesdrop from the shadows."
"Brennan: You teleport across the street through the shadows. In Sofia's departure from the Way of the Drunken Master, having embraced the way of the shadows, you are a ghost in the night, and..."
"Emily: I'll listen 'cause if it's a lover's quarrel, you know, I'll stay out of it, and in fact maybe it's kind of fun to hear some lovers really get into it, and be reminded that romance isn't all, you know, roses and bed and breakfast."
"Brennan: A hundred percent. Yeah, you hear that this is a couple that for all intents and purposes, should not be together. They are having a clearly bad time. They are not communicating well."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: It's a big argument going on, and yeah, I guess for Sofia being like, “Hey, this is great, a couple that's on the rocks”."
"Emily: I think if that's the case, then I come out of the shadows, and I say,"
Sofia: [with increasing distress] Life is too short. Do you know how nice it is to be with someone that you belong to be with? You are preventing both of each other from finding that person. Go! Leave each other! Right now!
Brennan: Give me an Intimidate roll.
"Emily: [laughs] I'm gonna intimidate you to not ruin, to not waste your lives. Nat 20!"
[Cast cheers and laughs]
"Sofia: [loudly] Do you understand there people out there who would not make you feel the way you both make each other feel? [quieter] Do you understand how it will feel to feel that, right?"
"Brennan: You see the woman looks up at you. Tears burst into her eyes. She goes,"
Woman: Oh my God. I can survive being single. I don't need to be in a bad relationship.
Sofia: Yeah.
"Brennan: She turns and goes,"
"Woman: Steve, go fuck yourself."
"Sofia: Yes, Steve."
"Brennan: And she flips this dude off. Steve is mostly angry at you, so he goes,"
"Steve: Who the fuck are you, lady? Get the fuck out."
"Brennan: You see that as the woman turns to walk away, he reflexively grabs her arm, hard."
"Emily: [laughing] Okay. I disarm him. And I flip him over. I flip him over into the shadow, so that I now have all advantage on all attacks against him, and he has disadvantage on every attack against me."
Brennan: [laughs] Go ahead. Go ahead and make your attack rolls.
"Emily: Okay. I think I— mm. I don't like that he touched her, but I'm not really trying-- I'm trying to like, I'm trying to control his body but not really hurt him."
Brennan: Okay. Copy that.
Emily: Not really like— Okay. So I think I just want to physically control his body so that he doesn't try to do that to another woman again. The first one is gonna be a 27 to hit.
Brennan: [laughs] Yeah. For sure.
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna go for a Stunning Strike. That's gonna be, okay, so that is eight damage, and then I'd like to try and Stunning Strike him, so just to stun him."
"Brennan: This dude is, you flip him into the shadows and move his arm in such a way that it like, pinches a nerve, and you see he goes into a full muscle back spasm where his full body can't move as he breathlessly gasps in pain. The young woman turns around to see that 'cause his hand is on her arm until you pinch his wrist so that all his fingers snap open off her arm so that she can watch as he, just like a sack of dirty laundry, flips off into the shadows and just-- thud. She looks at you and goes,"
Woman: [a pause as she looks confused] Th— you’re—
Sofia: Zumba.
"Brennan: [laughs] She puts her fingers over her lips like you've said a secret name of God to her and goes,"
Woman: [hushed] Thank you.
"Brennan: And rushes off into the night. Ricky. You... Oh actually, first of all, you know, Sofia, you get a text on your phone, but the guy is still muscle spasmed in the shadows."
"Emily: Oh, I think I wanna like release him from it now that he— now that the girl is safe."
Brennan: You release from it. He's gonna take a swing at you.
"Emily: Okay, he'll do it with disadvantage 'cause we're standing in the dark."
"Brennan: You see a terrible, sloppy, bullshit, break-your-wrist haymaker from someone who's never been in a fight coming your way."
"Emily: All right. I catch his wrist, and I break it."
Steve: [screams]
Brennan: He falls to the ground.
Sofia: I was trying not to hurt you.
Ally: Oh my god.
"Brennan: He goes,"
Steve: [screams and groans]
Brennan: Just on the ground.
"Sofia: See, this is what bothers me. I was trying to teach you a lesson about touching women, and you fucking did it again, so."
Brennan: [laughs] Incredible. Superhero Sofie Bikes is standing over this dude. You hear a little bling! on your phone.
Emily: I look at it.
"Brennan: You see a text from Esther saying,"
"Esther: Hey, Sofie. Miss you. Hope you're well..."
"Brennan: And then you see another one dropping a pin from her find-a-friend’s, which several months ago, she asked for you guys to turn on your mutual find- a-friend, and she was like,"
Esther: Cool that you're in Clinton Hill. Seems like you're doing some roof hopping. Hope everything's okay.
"Brennan: Then under that says,"
Esther: Seems like you're in the neighborhood. Wanna grab a bite?
Emily: Yeah. I think I call her back.
"Brennan: Cool. Okay, she picks up, and she's like,"
"Esther: Hey, oh god. Sofie, how's it going?"
"Sofia: Sorry, I just thought it was easier this way. Yeah, let's get a bite to eat. Where do you wanna go?"
"Esther: Let's go run the car somewhere. I'm not gonna be free for another like two hours. Does like a late dinner, like a 9:30 dinner work for you?"
"Sofia: Oh, okay. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Uh huh."
"Esther: Okay, all right, well, miss you! It'd be great to see you. Hope you're well!"
"Sofia: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I know, I am. Yeah, you too. Bye."
"Brennan: Phone goes off. Ricky you get a text immediately being like,"
"Esther: Sweetheart, Sofia's in the neighborhood. Looks like she's roof hopping. I'm not gonna be able to get away from work for another two hours. Can you go check on her?"
Ricky: I could go hop on some roofs.
[Brennan and Emily laugh]
Zac: I send her a selfie of me and Rusty and Ox.
Ricky: Just hanging out.
Brennan: [laughs] Immediate heart emoticon on the selfie.
Ricky: Roof hopping crew.
[Emily laughs]
Ricky: Rusty will not hop on roofs though. I think he's too old for that.
(laughing)
"Brennan: You immediately get a little notification as Esther adds this photo to a Dropbox folder called ""Ricky Selfies."""
(laughing)
"Brennan: You take off. Sofia, after a little while, Ricky finds you on a rooftop somewhere in Brooklyn. I don't think you got any advanced notice that Ricky was gonna swing by necessarily, but Ricky, give me an Insight and a Persuasion check."
"Zac: Insight would be, sorry. Oh, 14, and Persuasion, is what you said?"
"Brennan: Oh, Perception. Perception."
"Zac: And I do Perception with advantage, right?"
Brennan: Yes. Ever since you got turned into a dog momentarily.
Zac: 18 on Perception.
"Brennan: Cool. You smell a little bit on Sofia, just some of those like those dog’s senses. You smell a little bit of adrenaline and the fear sweat of bad men."
"Ricky: Sofia, are you cool? Sofia, hey."
"Sofia: Whoa. Oh, hi, Mr. March, How are you?"
"Ricky: I'm good. Hey, are you okay? 'Cause I can smell, it seems like there were some bad vibes around here recently."
"Sofia: Yeah, it's okay. I broke their wrist though."
"Ricky: Oh, shit."
"Sofia: Yeah, there was a bad vibe. I broke his wrist. I'm hoping that it leads to meaningful introspection."
"Ricky: Okay. Sofia, I."
"Sofia: Yeah, how are you?"
Ricky: I'm good.
Sofia: I feel like I haven't seen you in a while.
"Ricky: I'm pretty good. I, you know, I sort of changed jobs. I have a different, you know."
"Sofia: Yeah, I know. I got the calendar this year, and you weren't in it."
(laughing)
"Ricky: Yeah, that's been, you know, an adjustment, not being in that calendar. Look, are you okay? What are you doing right now?"
"Sofia: Oh, I mean I'm just kind of, you know. My psychic said that I'm falling from a tower, right, so I'm just taking it very literally."
"Ricky: Well, you know, I'm not a firefighter anymore, and so safety is not one hundred percent my goal all the time, although it is a pretty heavy hobby of mine. And I should say that you probably shouldn't jump off a giant tower. It seems maybe not the safest thing in the world. I have faith in you that you have abilities to handle a situation like that, but just would, you know. I recommend caution to everyone."
"Sofia: Yeah. You know, Ricky, I think it's really sweet, but I do want you to feel comfortable that I can jump off a lot of things, and I have a lot of resources at my disposal to make it as convenient as possible, and in general, I think the people you should worry about the most are the people who cross my path."
Ricky: Wow.
(laughing)
"Sofia: I mean like who cross my, you know."
"Ricky: Are you out for vengeance right now? I feel there's a bit, you know."
"Sofia: No, I'm just out. I just, you know, going home is always a little bit of a reality check, so, you know, I stay out late."
"Ricky: Yeah, well I don't know. It seems like Esther talked to you, but if you want to hang out with us, you know in a little bit."
"Sofia: Yeah, that'd be great, yeah."
"Ricky: I think that'd be fun, and also like it's just, I mean, I don't really get to like have this conversation with that many people, but hopping on roofs is fucking tight now, you know."
"Sofia: Thank you. See? That’s what I'm saying. I absolutely appreciate how you feel about safety, but when you practice something enough, you can kind of put safety in the backseat a little bit, you know?"
"Ricky: Yeah, when you get a level of comfortability with something, you can just, you know, you can have fun with it."
"Sofia: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, so if you wanted to just like hop a bunch of roofs, we could do that until Esther was free."
"Ricky: Tight. Oh, did I show you this?"
Zac: And I make Ox do a backflip again.
[Ox woofs]
Sofia: Oh my God.
Emily: Sofia faints.
Ricky: I've been training him.
Sofia: Did that dog just do a backflip?
"Ricky: Yeah, he can do the thing where he hops off my shoulder and catches a frisbee, and he can dart between my legs like dog show style."
Emily: Can I Minor Illusion a frisbee to try to see this?
"Ricky: As long as it's over the roofs. I'd appreciate that, but yes."
Sofia: Okay. Wow.
"Brennan: You hurl a frisbee, you see that as you hurl the frisbee, Sofia, it's made of sparkling light, and the sparkling light around it transforms into La Gran Gata who catches it herself, going,"
La Gran Gata: It is mine. [chomps frisbee]
(Emily and Ally laugh)
Sofia: She's very greedy. I love that about her. Yeah. How are things with Esther by the way?
"Ricky: Oh, I mean, we just..."
"Sofia: You know, I know a jewelry shop around here that stays open late."
Ricky: ...Okay. Um...
Sofia: If you wanna go. I'm just saying I might go there to look for some stuff.
Ricky: Late night jewelry shop?
Sofia: Yeah.
"Ricky: Hey, you know this is honestly interesting to me. It's the second person who's asked me about a jewelry shop lately, and do I come off like a jewelry guy? Like, I don't, it's usually not very functional to me. I don't think about jewelry."
"Sofia: Yeah, no, sometimes it's like a fun present or a fun like, a token meaning something else."
"Ricky: Oh, cool. Yeah, well, I guess I'll go with you if you wanna go."
Sofia: Okay.
"Emily: [laughing nearly too hard to speak] Me and Ricky go look at engagement rings, but I never call it out. I pretend like I'm looking for myself."
Ricky: These are cool.
Ally: Bummer.
Ricky: Are you gonna buy a couple of these? These are really expensive.
"Sofia: No, Ricky. I'm not. I'm not, no."
"Ricky: Okay, so I guess I'll see what Esther's doing."
"Sofia: Yeah, okay. Okay."
"Brennan: You guys do some roof jumping. Ox and La Gran Gata keep their respectful distance from each other, and you eventually end up at a tiny, little, very... You end up at a tiny, little Italian restaurant around the corner. Like couple of tables, very small, great food, not that expensive, and Esther comes in and sees you, Sofia. You've probably been working with her not too infrequent, so it's not like you've gone months without seeing her, but she walks up and goes,"
Esther: Sofie!
Brennan: And puts her arms wide and gives you a big hug.
Emily: I lean into the hug.
"Sofia: Esther, I'm actually really glad to see you. I have some sort of more official business to maybe talk about unless you wanna just shoot the shit. We can talk about it later in a more official capacity."
"Esther: No, go for it. Let's sit down."
"Brennan: You guys sit down, get some bread and olive oil, and some like little candle light. She goes like,"
"Esther: Yeah, absolutely."
"Emily: Wait, now I feel like I'm crashing their date."
Sofia: This is very romantic. Do the two of you just wanna be alone?
"Brennan: She says,"
"Esther: No, I mean, this is like our, one of our like local go-tos, but it's not here all the time, yeah."
"Sofia: Okay. It's just, it's much fancier than we have in Staten Island."
"Esther: Yeah, I mean it's like at Clinton Hill. This is, I think this is sort of pretty, yeah, you know. I'm sorry if it made you uncomfortable. I didn't want to."
Sofia: You're fine.
"Esther: Yeah. But yeah, what did you wanna talk about?"
"Sofia: Okay, well I guess I've been doing a lot of reading at the library at the monastery because they actually have like many interesting texts, and, you know, reading is a hobby I picked up in sobriety that's actually a pretty underrated hobby. It's..."
"Brennan: Esther nods vigorously. She says,"
"Esther: Yeah. Yay books. Yeah, a hundred percent."
"Ricky: Honestly, I agree. I feel similarly."
"Sofia: Yeah? What's your favorite book, Ricky?"
"Ricky: Gosh, my favorite book. 'The Mind Hacker,' it's a near future a novel about water rights and, and also Bitcoin. I didn't kind of catch a lot of it and didn't quite understand what it was about, but."
Sofia: That's cool.
Ricky: There's definitely layers of mystery throughout.
Sofia: Wow.
Ally: It just says that verbatim on the back of the book.
(laughing)
Zac: He's been reading this book for two years.
"[ethereal, soft background music]"
"Sofia: Well, yeah, I've so I've been going through a lot of the books at the monastery, and a couple things keep coming up that are a little strange, and I was curious if Gramercy Occult Society knew anything more about it, but, you know, a lot of the books at the monastery, it's very practical, very pragmatic, you know, how do you defend yourself against X, Y, or Z, but they keep referencing sort of like monsters and beasts from like deep dreams."
"Brennan: Esther sort of furrows her brow a little bit, and..."
Sofia: Like something deeper than what we went and saw.
"Brennan: She sort of thinks for a moment and says,"
"Esther: Huh. Well, I feel like a lot of that is conjecture. I mean,"
"Brennan: You see that she looks very interested. She says,"
"Esther: I remember you talking about finding some of these older scrolls about like the most dangerous forms of dream entities, but, you know, there's so much we don't know about the geography of Nod. This is sort of, I mean, I've read some things that are talking, that talk about like different other cities' relationships with the dreamscape and other things like that. What have you kind of read about the... Have you read anything about like deeper dreaming or no?"
"Sofia: Well, I guess the thing that's kind of bumping me is that like, you know, that you say, “Oh, it's just conjecture,” but like the Order of the Concrete Fist is all about what is. They are the opposite of conjecture, and so when I read, you know, bestiaries about deep dream beasts that only come out sometimes that doesn't feel, it's not in their style to be hypothesizing."
"Brennan: She looks to you and says,"
"Esther: Okay. Well, yeah, it's true that we, there's a lot we don't know about Nod even still. I mean the society is trying to bring on new members right now to kind of engage in all the work that needs to be done. Do you think, look I don't wanna... the order and the society have had periods of tension in their working relationship over the past century and a half in New York City."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Esther: It... I would be op- listen this is, it's you and me, you're the chosen one. I'm the chairwoman and head of the order, head of the society. If we said thumbs up, do you think you and the other monks might be into a more formal exchange of resources? I mean, if there's stuff the monks know about, things deeper-"
Sofia: I mean.
Esther: Yeah.
"Sofia: Yeah, I haven't really... If anything, it was probably a little, a little... I probably jumped the gun by telling you because we're friends. I probably should have run it by the other monks. I mean Nadia at the library knows I've been looking into this stuff, but I'll bring it up with them, I'm sure I can."
"Esther: Yeah, I mean that sounds..."
Sofia: I'd love to pool our resources. I don't think that there's any reason that we shouldn't.
Esther: I think we should.
Sofia: Right?
"Esther: I mean this is the order, the society, and two Voxes in the city at the same time. We have..."
Sofia: A rare moment.
"Esther: The planets have aligned as they say. Yes. Talk to the monks, and let's put our heads together."
Sofia: Okay.
Brennan: You see that she... Go ahead and give me an Insight check real quick.
Emily: Nat 1.
"Brennan: Here's the deal. Sofia has been burning the midnight oil researching, and basically what you had discovered that about the nature of Nod was basically that the sixth borough is the part of the dreaming that touches New York and the Unsleeping City, right? And what Sofia's revelations were about were about the relationship of like, is Nod, I guess like what started Sofia's journey was, is Nod the fullness of the dreaming, or is there more dreaming past Nod the farther you get away from the Unsleeping City in New York. And Sofia's found out some troubling things. You were about to see Esther connecting dots in her own head with some of the society's resources until your guys' food arrived, and you saw her, in perfect rhythm with Ricky setting up his plate, just take something from her plate that she knew Ricky would want, that she wouldn't want and put it on his plate, and there's just a small squeeze of his arm."
Emily rolls a die on her screen.
Zac: Puts a whole meatball in his mouth.
"Emily: Okay, that was a trigger for me, but I passed."
(laughing)
Brennan: So you...
"Ricky: The book says it's a, you know, it's a thrill ride of suspense."
(laughing)
"Ricky: So, that's also..."
Ally: He's holding the book.
Ricky: Important to consider that.
"Ally: He's trying to be one of those guys that has a book in his back pocket like,"
Lou: [crosstalk] Always ready to go.
"Ally: “Oh, just on the go. I'm just reading.”"
Ricky: This is my favorite book.
"Brennan: Sofia, Esther and Ricky walk off arm in arm that night, and Ricky, Esther walks away with you and looks up and goes,"
Esther: How do you think Sofia's doing?
"Ricky: That's a hard question. I feel like she seems really busy. I don't know if she's too busy, you know? I think she's, maybe like there've been times where I wasn't feeling so great, so I worked out super hard, and I just would do two three-a-days."
"Esther: Sorry, two three-a-days?"
"Ricky: So sometimes, so you know I do two-a-days, right?"
Esther: Of course. Yes.
"Ricky: So I would add two three-a-days to every week, and so three days, so two days of a week, I would work out three times, and that was usually 'cause I wasn't feeling great."
"Brennan: As you do that you see Esther just nods, and her eyes just sort of slowly migrate down to your abs through like your baseball shirt. She's like,"
Esther: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
"Ricky: You know, you know what makes me... Hey, Esther? Sorry, my eyes are up here."
"Esther: Yeah. [jerks her head up] Sweetie, yes of course. Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely."
"Ricky: What's interesting to me is like, I feel like in the past when I had questions like this, I used to ask my ax, and I'd feel like, I dunno, I was just thinking about that today."
"Brennan: See, she looks and says,"
"Esther: Yeah, I mean, what you did with the questing blade was incredibly selfless, sweetie."
"Brennan: You guys get back to the apartment together, and Esther takes a moment to sort of put some stuff away and then sits on your couch. Again, super lovely, cozy home together, and she looks at you and says,"
"Esther: Sweetie, you... You're very good all the time, and it's not like you don't take care of yourself. Like, you do take care of yourself physically, mentally, like you're all about safety. Is there... It was a huge sacrifice when you gave up the questing blade because that was that was your key into the Unsleeping City. That's how you met me. We went to the Hall of Heroes, and you saw the other champions of New York, the defenders of the city, and I think you know you always do that, like hero Ricky Matsui thing of anytime you make a big sacrifice, you're so quick to go, 'Anyone would have done it. It's the right thing to do. It's the thing I have to do.' But occasionally, if you do something selfless, it's okay to acknowledge that it like stings a little bit. It's okay if part of you misses that."
"Ricky: Yeah, I hear you. Well I'll, I mean anyone would have done that. It was the right thing to do..."
"Esther: [covers her face] Goddamn it, Ricky, no. No."
"Ricky: That's definitely true, but..."
"Esther: No, that's not, I wasn't saying it in that."
"Ricky: You know, to be honest, every now and then, I instinctively reach for my ax, and it's not there and I, I feel a tiny bit sad, not so much 'cause I want to hit things or whatever, but, you know, he was kind of a bud, and..."
Esther: You deserve a bud.
Ricky: Yeah.
"Brennan: She gives you a big warm comforting hug and buries her face and your neck, and goes,"
"Esther: Well, you know, questing blades are pretty rare, but who knows? Maybe, maybe the questing blade will return or come back, I don't know but..."
Ricky: I looked on Craigslist. I couldn't find anything.
"Esther: Probably not Craigslist, hun. Yeah, probably not Craigslist. Probably a different website or maybe not a website at all, maybe something more magical than that."
Ricky: A magical website?
Esther: No.
(laughing)
Esther: You see...
"Ricky: It just feels like, sometimes to me, the magical thing could be honestly any regular thing that's magical, you know, like, magical podcasts or something like that, you know, or a magical..."
"Esther: We should start a magical podcast. I feel like we, if we did release a magical podcast, it's not a huge audience of people that can perceive magical things, but that could be very fun, that could be a fun couple thing to do."
Ricky: Yeah I would do that.
"Brennan: You see, she looks at you and goes,"
"Esther: I'll keep an eye out for anything like that. In the meantime, I know that Sofia is gonna need some help tomorrow just like keeping an eye on the city during Halloween, and questing blade or not, I know you're off from work tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow like tag along with Sofia and like hit the old stomping grounds again, you know, go keep the city safe."
"Ricky: Uh… Gosh, I like safety. Gosh."
[Brennan laughing]
"Ricky: Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. I'll hop some roofs hanging out with Sofia. It sounds like a good Halloween. Thanks, babe."
"Esther: You got it, babe."
"Brennan: And you guys get ready for the night. Sofia, you head back to Staten Island, what do you do as you arrive? How do you make your return to your home in Staten Island?"
"Emily: I get in my car. I go all the way back to the Upper West side where my car is, and then I drive back, once again going through Bay Ridge and taking the Verrazano Bridge."
"Brennan: You take the Verrazano. You're driving to Spaghetti's Bakery. You pass by the empty lot where your house used to be, and you see a shimmering, scintillating column of light very faintly but almost like fireflies or something like that, and you see a shape turns and beckons to you there as a mama deer and two fawns come out of the woodline."
"Emily: I put the car into idle, leave the keys in it, and open the door and try to follow them."
Brennan: You go.
Zac: Is the car still moving?
"Brennan: Yeah. (laughing) The car just kind of inches forward very slowly. Ghost riding. Sofia, you walk over. It's been a couple weeks, but as you approach, you see that the light sort of motes, the fireflies coalesce, and with wings on his back, Dale appears before you."
"Emily: And, but I saw him a couple weeks ago?"
"Brennan: Yeah, probably like six weeks ago."
Emily: Oh. Can I touch him? Is he corporeal?
Brennan: He's corporeal.
"Emily: Okay, cool. I make out with him."
"Brennan: He, 'cause he's covered in angel blood. He's got the questing blade on his side. He's beaten his way out of heaven again. You guys make out hard. You can tell that he's so invested in this tiny amount of time he'll have, and the spaces between visits get longer and longer as the angels find ways to stop him from using the questing blade to get back out again. He's making out. You can tell the only thing as he's making out with you is every once in a while, he'll come up for air and go,"
"Dale: Look, look, look, look, look, look. They're licking the dew off the grass."
"Sofia: Oh my god. I mean it's just, I was gonna say it's heaven on earth, but you're literally heaven on earth, so I mean, there's just a lot of that right now."
"Brennan: You guys fully make out. I will say that like, you see that the deer start going back into the woods. As the deer retreat further into the woods, Dale's like,"
Dale: Do you wanna follow them?
"Sofia: Okay, yeah."
"Brennan: You go follow them with Dale into the woods. You quickly lose the deer in the woods and return to making out, and I would say whatever... Dale is down for whatever Sofia wants to do in those midnight Staten Island forests with the smell of the New York Times printing factory and the world's largest or America's largest landfill."
(Emily laughing)
Zac: Beautiful.
Brennan: Beautiful. Off in the distance.
"Emily: I think we do exactly what you imagined. And she's gonna be like,"
"Sofia: I don't know, is this gonna work? Is this... Okay."
"Dale: It’ll work, it’ll work."
"Sofia: Yeah, I don't entirely understand how you're physically here, but I'm not gonna take it for granted."
"Dale: Hey, these are not, you don't have to ask these questions. If it works, it works."
"Brennan: And you see, he smiles at you and winks and says,"
Dale: It is what it is.
"Sofia: It is what it is. It's, yeah, which is honestly a bad motto. It's not a great motto. It's not inspirational, but it is what it is."
"Brennan: He nods. You two are in a tiny clearing off in these sort of Staten Island trees lying down on the ground, looking up at no stars at all because of all the light pollution from New York City. Just looking at the underside of gray clouds and empty sky. Just going."
Sofia: Beautiful.
Dale: Wow.
"Sofia: So, Dale, just so I can kind of get my bearings, what's the social scene in heaven like?"
"Dale: You know, there's a lot of wild people up there. Some people, you would expect. Some people, you honestly really wouldn't, and the people who aren't there are surprising. There's some people that you really think would be there, and they're not there."
"Sofia: Wow, wow. I guess I'm trying to understand like, what's your social life like up there?"
"Dale: Oh. I don't really, I don't really have, I don't really have one up there."
Sofia: Okay.
"Dale: You know, there's the other, I talked to other monks both from the Concrete Fist and from other orders. There's a tremendous amount of sort of enlightened people, and incredible sages and scholars and... Why do you ask, if I can ask?"
"Sofia: I just, you know, our visits are, they're not scheduled, so every time I see you, it's kind of a surprise, and then I wonder if they'll stop at some point, and if there would ever be something in heaven that would, you know, beyond the angels that are physically trying to prevent you from coming back down, if there was, you know, if there was ever going to be anything else that might prevent you from coming down. Like if you, I don't know, met someone up there."
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Insight check.
Emily: 19.
"Brennan: Also, Dale got a 24 on an Insight check for you. You look at him and see that he looks sort of confused and..."
"Sofia: I'm sorry, I know this isn't a fair conversation. I just, you know..."
"Dale: No, I understand. I don't really spend a lot of time focusing on heaven, paradise, you know, the beyond. I'm mostly just trying to plot and figure out ways to get past security and get back here."
Brennan: What is he reading on Sofia right now?
"Emily: What he's reading on Sofia is that she is in the opposite situation, but the same situation at the same time where she's not really living in the present. She's kind of just always, when she daydreams, it's daydreaming about getting to where he is."
"Brennan: He looks at you, and it gets very quiet for a while. He goes,"
Dale: How about you? How's your social life down here?
Sofia: It's awesome.
(laughing)
Sofia: I just had dinner with Ricky and Esther.
"Dale: Oh, great. Oh, Ricky's such a good dude."
"Sofia: I mean, yeah."
Dale: He's the founder of the feast. He's why I'm even able to come here.
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah. So yeah, I'm really, I'm really having a lot of fun."
"Brennan: He looks at you lie to his face, and he goes,"
"[slow, jazzy music]"
Dale: These are really hard for you.
"Sofia: Oh, please don't read that from what I just said. It would be harder if it didn't happen, and I hope you understand that."
"Dale: Right. No, you're right. I... Yeah. There's... The things that are waiting for us past here are not worse considering each and every day of your life here in this place."
(slow music)
Dale: Huh.
"Brennan: You see, he starts crying pretty hard, without sobbing, but you just see those sort of tears are coming down his face."
"Sofia: Why, why? Why are you crying? We're..."
Dale: Nothing. I'm sorry.
Sofia: We both agree that we miss each other. Isn't that beautiful?
Dale: Of course. Of course it's beautiful. Of course.
"Sofia: Is it hurting you to come see me? God, it is, isn't it? I mean, you should be enjoying paradise. You shouldn't be trying to escape it all the time. For what?"
"Brennan: He smiles and looks off and just goes,"
"Dale: I... Yeah, I got some... Sorry I'm having a hard time articulating things. [chipper voice] How is the monastery? Cindy, Nadia, Solomon, everyone's good? First Fist of the monastery. So cool. Chosen one."
"Sofia: Yeah, it's a lot of paperwork, yeah."
"Dale: Mostly I mean it's a whole monastery about pragmatism and realism. So the being chosen one is mostly paperwork, and just sort of..."
"Sofia: Mostly paperwork, yeah."
"Dale: Sorting out the kind of tax status of the monastery. Yeah, it's great. Woo. Fun."
"Sofia: Yeah, I know. I'm learning a lot, and I see why you loved it so much."
(giggling)
"Brennan: He nods and says,"
Dale: I'm so proud. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
"Sofia: Well, you are obviously the best thing that ever happened to me."
"Brennan: He goes silent, and you guys spend a nice long amount of time together, continuing to talk about favorite memories, things shared."
"Emily: Okay, so it transitions to good because I definitely feel nervous from this conversation."
Brennan: You see that Dale moves it in the direction of good and sweet things.
Emily: Okay. Cool.
"Brennan: And it almost seems like he makes it like a perfect night, like you hit every one of your inside jokes, all of your favorite bits, every great memory all the way down, and that he takes a lot of time to say like little things here and there like bits of advice about the order and things that he wished he had known back when he was a monk, and stacks all these things up until truly it's like the sky is getting light in the East, and you wake up in the middle of the day, covered in ants on a hot patch of dirt. You fell asleep in Dale's arms, and he is gone."
"Emily: Okay, I, the player, know exactly what that means. Does Sofia know what that means? What you just described mean?"
"[Brennan claps, laughs]"
Emily: Does she pick up on the fact that he made it the perfect night and also gives all of the tips that he needs to give?
Brennan: Go ahead and roll. Give me a DC 20 insight check.
"Emily: Okay, I desperately want to fail this 'cause I don't wanna know. 6 plus a 3. 9. I don't know it! Great. Good."
"[Brennan and Lou clap, Emily laughs]"
"Sofia: Wow, that was just an awesome evening. Wow, I feel really... I mean, Dale really went out of his way to like have a good time. That was awesome."
"Brennan: [laughs] Incredible. The following day. It's Halloween. We have some characters that had a lot of crazy shit happen the preceding night. The following morning, Pete and Cody, you guys are now living in the same spot. The following morning. Cody, you know like the nearby like bagel spot and place to get like a breakfast sandwich and stuff like that. Pete, this dude who got infernal awakened into the Unsleeping City last night is now your roommate."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: What are you guys... As you guys dive into it the next morning on your way to get breakfast, you're walking down like Steinway street and Astoria, what are you guys talking about?"
"Ally: Okay, I think I wanna know like everything about what you promised, what the like, do you have the contract on you, or like what the fuck? What are talking about?"
"Murph: Let me see. Fuck, I was so excited. Did I bring the book with me or the contract?"
"Brennan: [laughs] Give me, honestly, a DC 5 Intelligence check."
"Murph: Oh, my Intelligence is okay. It's my Wisdom that's bad."
Brennan: Okay.
"Murph: Okay, I'm fine. Dirty 20. I rolled an 18."
Brennan: Great.
"Murph: So yeah I guess I show the back of the ripped WWE poster that is signed in my blood that doesn't, I think, doesn't clarify anything. It just says that I gave my soul away essentially."
"Brennan: Go ahead, give me an Arcana check, Pete."
"Ally: Oh, great. Okay. So this is gonna be, oh, yeah 27."
"Brennan: Ooh, doctor. This is the fucking dumbest infernal contract you've ever seen. You've ever seen. It's on the back of a WWE poster, crisp out of the plastic, scrawled in blood. It's very clear that Cody got woozy from blood loss because he wrote the full word ""Night Angel"" out in his own blood, which is too long to write in your own blood without getting woozy. The deal, the contract, the bargain is in exchange for selling his soul, he gets to work for this devil."
"Pete: What? This was a bad deal, dude. What the fuck were you thinking?"
Cody: Lucifer himself fucking comes out of hell.
Pete: No. No! This is a random little devil.
"Cody: [crosstalk] And tells you that you can save the mall, and you won't sell your fucking soul?"
(laughing)
"Ally: Oh my god. Do I have any idea of like, why devils would be back or?"
"Brennan: On a 27, you know a shitload. Ask me as many, truly as many questions as you want. First of all, you know Bazathrax. Memories comes up from Emma Lazarus back when she was the Vox Phantasma of New York. Bazathrax is a lesser, lesser, lesser devil lord, like sub, sub, sub devil lord. He is literally a lord of the second out of nine pits of hell. He's in the number two, he's in one of the number two, and like kind of right through the front door, and he is the sub lord of reckless decisions. That's his fiendish domain is reckless decisions, and literally he's what you're realizing is like the, like the Highway Hex is still here, like Robert Moses is gone, but the thing that kind of shunts powerful devils and fairy creatures and celestials like out of New York. Bazathrax is one of the larger entities that could have made it through the highway hex, so also you remember that, like Isabella Infierno, back three years ago, was hell's representative here, and she was a succubus. She was like not a high ranking devil either, like again one of the most powerful... It's sort of like a net that bigger fish can't swim through, but smaller ones can, and so like, Isabella could make it through, but because no one could like, no one bigger than her could come get her, she just like joined up with Robert Moses and hung out for years, right? But with her gone, there is literally zero infernal presence in the city, so you're like, ""Oh, someone like Bazathrax who is a full-stop chump could still clean up here because there's fucking no competition, and there's 8 million people."""
"Ally: Yes. Okay, can I..."
"Pete: Hey, 'Night Angel' Cody, can you fucking summon Bazathrax please? I need to talk to this guy."
"Cody: I was super pumped when it happened. I'm not a hundred percent sure if I can, but I think I can 'cause technically he's my boss now."
"Pete: Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, cool man."
Cody: Cool.
Emily: You know how employees can always summon their boss?
"Cody: You’re cool, right? 'Cause like you can like make butterflies and shit, so you made a deal with another devil or something, right? We're getting the mall back."
"Ally: Okay. I explain like, can I just explain a lot more to Cody? Like,"
"Pete: There's actually a whole group of people. We work to keep the city safe, or..."
Brennan: Yeah.
Ally: Can I explain? Yeah.
Cody: [nodding knowingly] You guys are Blade.
"Pete: And you keep, see, I notice, man, that you keep bringing it back to the mall. We're actually, none of us are working on the mall. I'm so sorry to tell you."
"Cody: So that's sort of my thing, I guess."
Pete: I'm not the Vox Phantasma for the mall. I'm like for the whole city.
Cody: But I am.
"Pete: No, dude. Well, yeah maybe. Yeah, yeah. You're kind of the Vox Populi of the mall."
"Cody: Got it. Cool. Yeah, I think I get like the fucking gist of it. Let me call Lucifer and see if he wants to..."
"Pete: Bazathrax, yeah."
"Cody: Maybe that'll, maybe he'll sort it out."
"Pete: Great, yeah bring him in."
[Breaking Benjamin soundalike rock music]
"Cody: Oh mighty Lucifer, in the name of Jeff Hardy and the Hardy Boyz, in the name of Breaking Benjamin and all the other sick ass nu metal bands, I summon you."
Murph: And then I just like pull out a knife and stab myself in the leg.
"Pete: No, dude, you don't have... You just gotta, you just gotta say his name I think, man, don't worry about it. You don't have to hurt yourself."
"Brennan: On that 27, first of all, Cody, you fall to the ground. You have a bad leg stab."
Cody: Fuck.
"Brennan: It's bad. For Pete, you can tell that nothing happened here because the devil's name is not Lucifer, so this is, it's not gonna work."
"Pete: So, hey, man, look you just got to say, 'Bazathrax.' You gotta summon Bazathrax. You got me?"
"Murph: I say the exact same thing again except Bazathrax, and I stab my leg again."
Cody: Fuck!
"Pete: No, no, no, you don't have to fucking stab yourself, man."
"Brennan: In a burst of nasty like sewer smoke, a man hole cover pops up, and you, Pete, see Bazathrax again. Marmot head, ram's horns, slimy humanoid, very like emaciated looking torso with long claws and like a centaur, capybara lower body with a long rat tail that goes,"
Bazathrax: Holy shit.
Brennan: And crawls out of this smoking manhole.
"Ally: Okay, I'd like to grab him by the collar and shove him against a wall and be like,"
Pete: What the fuck are you doing here? Tell me everything.
"Brennan: Holy shit, okay. Go ahead and roll initiative."
"Ally: Oh, not Intimidation?"
"Brennan: Actually, yeah, before you roll, Intimidation, gimme Intimidate first."
"Ally: Okay. Ooh, that's a 28."
"[quiet, electronic, bass-heavy background music]"
"Brennan: [laughing] Cody, you've seen Pete do some like butterfly stuff. As Pete slams this demon, you see that the wall behind Bazathrax turns into pure liquid chrome, and circling daisy chains of happy, what look like, children's dolls with buttons sewed into their eyes, dancing in this technicolor swirl going into infinity, reach out, and with their little puffy hands, grab Bazathrax and restrain him in this circling phantasmagoria. Bazathrax goes,"
"Bazathrax: Whoa, whoa, whoa, I give up. I full give up. I surrender."
Ally: My butterfly is flipping him off.
"Cody: Are you fucking kidding me, dude? Can I sell my soul to Pete? Can you trade my soul?"
"Brennan: He says,"
Bazathrax: Fuck you!
"Pete: Well, I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try to get your soul back. Bazathrax, what the fuck are you doing here? How did you get here? What's going on? Tell me."
"Bazathrax: I don't fucking know, dude, I don't fucking know. The kid summoned me all right? He said my name in the fucking book, and he signed his soul. You can't sell your soul to shit, dude, you work for me!"
"Brennan: Cody, you see that he snaps one of his fingers even while restrained, and you slam down to one knee with the sword in your hand."
"Cody: It's so fucking sick that I work for a devil, but Lucifer kind of sucks."
"Ally: Can I like, with any sort of magic, create like a contract for Bazathrax to sign and try to somehow get Cody out of this?"
Brennan: Give me an Arcana check here.
"Ally: Okay. What is my Arcana? Oh, good. Ooh, 20 but not nat."
"Brennan: Cool. You feel like this devil's probably not gonna sign anything because the worst you could do to this devil really is banish him back to hell, and then he would just be in hell, but one soul richer right? So there's not, like, you and he are at an impasse because you're vastly more powerful than him, but because of the nature of what he is, there's like a short list of things you can do to a guy like this, right?"
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: But you could definitely get some concessions out of him because he's scared of you.
"Ally: Yeah, I wanna know everything or what's going on. What his plans are."
"Pete: Cody, let Cody stand back up. Jesus Christ, man."
"Brennan: You see, he goes,"
"Bazathrax: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, hey, stand back up, kid. Stand back up. Do what the Vox Phantasma says, okay?"
Cody: Yes. I serve my dark master.
"Pete: No, dude."
Ally: I put my arm around Cody.
"Pete: Look, man, you don't. This is a fucking like weird old gym teacher."
"Cody: Do you have any— I understand, I understand, but I'm just trying to make the best of it because do you know how long I've been waiting for this? Do how many fucking goth kids just wait for the devil to fucking show up and just turn you into a fucking like hell warrior."
Pete: He's not the devil.
Cody: He’s a devil.
"Pete: He's honestly, he like stocks the vending machines of hell, man, like you're fucking talking to like not the devil."
Bazathrax: I wish. I fucking wish. That's a primo gig. That is a primo gig.
"Cody: All right, Bazathrax, you can work, you can stock the vending machines, I fucking believe in you, you fuck."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Bazathrax: Cody, Cody, I'm lying. I really am Lucifer. Don't worry. Don't worry. [winks] I really am, just shh, shh, shh, shush."
Cody: I don’t know who to believe anymore.
"Pete: Hey, Cody, okay... Actually, you know what? Bazathrax, just what, what's going on? Literally spill it."
"Brennan: You see, he says,"
"Bazathrax: Look, something fucked up is happening in the city. This place is crazy."
"Brennan: He goes like,"
"Bazathrax: There's, it's like, there's, there's no fucking devils here anywhere, and like, I don't know how to put it, but there's like something that's keeping like people from noticing when shit is weird or whatever."
"Pete: Yeah, yeah, we have that."
Cody: They're doing something at the mall. they're taking over everything.
Ally: I explain the Umbral Arcana to Cody.
"Pete: No, no, it's not the mall, again. Anyway, so, it's much bigger than the mall."
"Brennan: You see, Bazathrax says like,"
Bazathrax: Yeah.
"Brennan: He's like,"
"Bazathrax: That shit, it's fucking leaking out everywhere. It's getting thick and goopy in places, which is pretty fucking crazy."
"Brennan: He's like,"
Bazathrax: There's something fucked up. It's... It's going down. Has anyone been keeping an eye on the sewers? Do any of you heroes keep an eye on the sewers or anything?
Ally: Would I know if any of us have been doing like monitoring?
"Brennan: Well, not really since Kugrash died..."
Emily: Kug would have.
"Brennan: Yeah, Kug would have."
"Ally: I think I have like on my keychain, I have a little like Class of 2019 for Kugrash 'cause we all said he graduated, and I think I got everyone a little key chain that says that to remind them of Kugrash, and I just hold it."
"Brennan: I love that. Bazathrax says,"
"Bazathrax: That's all I know. I can help you find it. Look, something's fucked up in the sewers. Something's fucked up in the subways right now. There's a, there's a confluence. There is a confluence within the subways. That's all I know."
"[ominous, tense music]"
Pete: Tell me more. Can you take me there?
"Brennan: He says,"
"Bazathrax: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can take you there. I can take you there."
Cody: Are these demons friends or foes?
"Brennan: He says,"
Bazathrax: Oh it's not demons. It's coming from people.
"Brennan: You see, he says,"
Bazathrax: It's the antipopuli. [laughs]
Pete: Huh.
"Brennan: As he says “antipopuli”, Pete, I think... you hear “antipopuli”. Give me an Arcana check again."
Ally: Let's see. That is 11.
Brennan: Antipopuli is way out of your field of knowledge. This is some Kingston shit.
Ally: Okay. When am I gonna meet Kingston for that game?
"Brennan: That's happening probably like two days from now, but today's Halloween, so probably you gotta like, today might actually... You know that Sofia is gonna be busy doing shit today. It might be time to round up the troops."
"Ally: Yeah, okay. I send out a text to everyone just saying, “We got—” Just kind of explain this whole devil thing, and just say my new roommate got roped into it, and he's cool. Just,"
"Pete: I'm gonna introduce you to a guy. He's cool, just he's cool."
Brennan: Gotcha.
"Emily: As a way to get... Oh, sorry."
"Brennan: Sorry. I was gonna say, Iga Lisowski, the next morning it's Halloween, your kids are getting ready. Your chest is still changed after being unchanged for centuries."
Iga: I do not like this. I do not like this. [groans]
Siobhan: Is there anybody I feel like I could talk to about this? Like I'm somewhat within the confines of the...
"Brennan: Yeah, you're within the Unsleeping City, but you've just made a point to avoid those people because they're dangerous, and you like have a family and don't fuck with those kind of people."
Emily: We could say hypothetically that I would have probably texted you for like a tarot reading after seeing Dale or something like that.
"Brennan: I mean, you do know that you have one client who is an important fit. You know Sofia has divulged everything to you. I think Sofia's your go-to probably."
"Siobhan: Great. I will maybe text Sofia,"
"Iga: Hey, I need to talk to you. I can give you a reading at a discount."
(laughing)
Ally: Not even free!
Emily: Sofia immediately hops on the phone to call her.
Sofia: Hi.
Iga: Hello.
Sofia: Hi.
"Iga: Hi, Sofia. How are you doing?"
"Sofia: Honestly a little confused, which is why I texted you at all."
Iga: Yes. Fun. I have a thing that I need maybe some little help with.
"Sofia: Oh, absolutely. What can I do?"
"Iga: There is an heirloom that I have, a family heirloom, it's an important, let's say powerful heirloom."
"Sofia: Hmm, necklace, brooch."
"Iga: Sure. So something happened to this heirloom. It is a, it's a box I will tell you, it's a box that has power. Now, something happened last night. It has always had trees on it, and now it has you on it as well as the trees, so..."
"Sofia: I'm sorry, me or like a hypothetical you?"
"Iga: Yes, you. There is a picture of you and also a very, very buff looking man who is taking a selfie. This is, again, a hundreds of years old box. I do not know."
"Sofia: Madam Anastasia, have you, have you gotten the firefight... Do you have the firefighter's calendar from 2019?"
"Iga: Yes, of course I have the firefighter's calendar for 2019. It's the best one. They took out, they replaced Mr. March this year. I'm like, “What is going on?”"
"Sofia: Right, okay. Is there any resemblance between the man on your box and Mr. March?"
"Iga: Oh my God, this, yes, definitely is Mr. March. He is my favorite in that whole calendar."
Sofia: He's everyone's favorite.
"Brennan: I feel like, as you're having a text conversation, Sofia, you and Ricky just have like your feet off the side of the skyscraper you're like eating lunch on. Like, Ricky."
"Sofia: Yeah, would it be okay if me and Mr. March swung by and looked at this box?"
Iga: Yeah.
"Sofia: Is that the help that you were looking for, or did you?"
"Iga: I don't know. I mean if you think, yes. Do you or do you know somebody who's like good with magical items, or?"
Sofia: I know a couple people.
Emily: I guess I'll get on that group thread. Can I just add Madam Anastasia to the group thread?
"Brennan: You absolutely can, yes."
Iga: It's fine. It's my burner phone.
(laughing)
Lou: Welcome to the thread.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, so, as Iga is going to meet up, you see that Oskar says like,"
"Oskar: All right, you headed out for the day, darling?"
"Iga: Yes, I've got to, hmm. Yes. I'm going to, yes. I'm going out for a little bit."
"Brennan: Your husband looks at you with a look of, I have known that my wife does something bizarre for, you know, like 15 years and he goes,"
"Oskar: Okay, you have a great time to go out in the city to do your business. I love you."
"Iga: I love you. Hey, I'm going. If I go by the Carnegie Deli, I'll get you a sandwich."
"Oskar: Yes, please do. Also maybe we grab some, from Carnegie Deli, if they have that, the pickled radish, you know."
"Iga: Oh, yeah, no the, yes. Yes."
"Oskar: Great, I like it from there."
Brennan: You see that your kids are getting ready for Halloween later in the day. Look at you headed out with a box that is now travel sized. After you have compacted it with your magic.
Siobhan: I have that and Misiek in like a really big sort of hand-woven bag.
"Brennan: Incredible. You head out to meet Ricky and Sofia. Cody and Pete, you had the thing Bazathrax said. You're still carrying Bazathrax with you. Cody, very humiliating, your devil lord is being dragged around by Pete. You guys can see that Bazathrax is just on a sedan chair of like, sort of, they look like they're made of light paint. Like it's made of light, but it's dripping like paint would and splashing into light on the ground. Just a small like cushion of butterflies that he can't escape from of different colors is moving him along he's like,"
"Bazathrax: Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Cody: Dark lord, could you like, do devils ever like trade? Like could I get traded? Could you just like trade me up?"
"Bazathrax: It's not the fucking NBA, dude, okay? People don't get, no one's getting traded, all right? That's not gonna happen."
"Cody: [quietly] Fuck. [normal] Yes, my dark lord. This fucking rules. This fucking rules."
"Bazathrax: Whee, dude. Whee!"
"Ally: When we're walking, can I ask Cody about the mall? Like,"
"Pete: What's your thing with the mall, and what's happening with the mall right now?"
Cody: What's not happening with the mall right now is the question.
"Pete: This is gonna be poetic, isn't it?"
Cody: I worked at the Hot Topic. I was a mall goth.
Pete: Yeah.
"Cody: All my friends were there. I had friends who worked at Spencer's. I had friends who worked at Zumiez. Hell, I even had friends who worked at PacSun even though I don't like the sun. And then people started buying shit online, and it was really fucked up. First, Spencer's closed and then Zumiez not long after."
Pete: Whoa.
"Cody: And then PacSun, and Hot Topic stayed right till the end, but then they just shut the whole mall down, and now Gladiator’s coming with their, “Oh, we're on the internet, but we're gonna, we need a fucking campus.” Fucked up, so."
Pete: So they're just mowing it all down and making a fucking Gladiator campus?
"Cody: Yeah, they're making, like they said it was gonna be like a big job thing or some fucking bullshit, like they're just, like they're crushing all the small businesses like Sears. You know what I mean? Fucked up."
"Pete: Yeah, totally. Little mom and pop shops like Sears."
"Cody: Yeah, like Sears and the McDonald's is fucking closed. I have to walk like a fucking two miles to get to McDonald's."
Pete: That sucks.
"Brennan: You guys arrive where you've been headed, which is outside of St. Owens Memorial Hospital. Kingston, you're just getting off a shift, having been reached out to by young Pete here 'cause you knew that Kingston would know about that antipopuli thing."
"Ally: Yeah, can we go to like Kingston's little secret whatever room, or?"
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Murph: What does the devil look like in real life? Is it like Kugrash where it just looks like something weird, but not a devil?"
Brennan: It looks like a bunch of sagging helium balloons right now that all have satanic logos.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: So that's what everyone else is seeing as Pete has a bunch of sort of sad, half deflated, satanic balloons behind him."
Pete: Get over here.
[Brennan and Murph laugh]
Ally: Talking to these balloons.
[Lou laughs]
"Lou: Yeah, they uh, Kingston is fully dressed up for Halloween and is dressed like a pirate."
"Cody: Oh, shit. You're a goth, too?"
Kingston: What?
"Cody: It's so fucking good to, it's so good to meet another goth."
"Kingston: I've never been called a goth before. Nice to meet you. Pete, is this your new friend and your other new friend?"
"Pete: Yeah, look, Kingston doesn't usually wear eyeliner. It's just for his thing right now. Okay, yeah."
Murph: Cody looks extremely offended.
"Pete: Kingston, devils have gotten in. This devil right here, this is Bazathrax. He conned my new roommate into giving him his soul. We'll deal with that later, but he's said something about the antipopuli."
Bazathrax: Can I interject? I really didn't con him. He was extremely quick to offer.
Cody: I’ve been fucking waiting—
Pete: I need to believe that you conned him.
"Cody: Well, the thing is that Bazathrax is like, okay, you know when you start working at Hot Topic and there's like your manager, and then there's like corporate, so Lucifer is corporate, so that's my real boss. So I work for Lucifer."
Kingston: Okay.
Cody: I'm coming for Bazathrax's fucking job.
Pete: Okay.
"Kingston: All right. Okay. We can, we'll work through this I think. I think, Cody, it's nice to meet you. I'm Kingston Brown. We'll.."
Cody: Nice to meet you.
"Kingston: We can get into Bazathrax and all of that. I think that seems to be a little less pressing than, Pete, the antipopuli."
"Lou: Have I heard the word ""antipopuli"" said before?"
Brennan: You a hundred percent have. Go ahead and roll me a Religion check with advantage.
"Lou: Oh, what a thrill. Here we go now. It's only a 14."
"Brennan: Only 14. You know the term ""antipopuli,"" it basically refers to, it's like antimatter but made specifically of ill will towards people. Antipopuli is rooted in the culture of the place that it's in. So the antipopuli of a like, you know, small, quaint, Northeastern town might be like, oh, not saying hi to Jeff down at, like, the lumber store, right? antipopuli in New York is specifically related to the misanthropic ill will and refutation of the social norms of the city that create a magically toxic spiritual substance. And when it congregates, it can become spiritually poisonous to people in a very potent way. It's extremely dangerous stuff. It is a combination of misanthropy, ill will, and substance that exists in direct opposition to the social customs and norms of a place."
"Lou: That gets Kingston real nervous 'cause I don't know. Well, it sounds like, yeah, I think I like, look at Pete and I'm like,"
"Kingston: Okay. I mean, the fact that we have anti-people building up or antipopuli building up is a bad thing, and it sounds, I mean, this definitely means that there's a bigger problem going on, but I mean, if there's something we can handle right now that your Bazathrax can maybe bring us to, it feels like we should get the gang together and go handle this."
"Pete: I think so too. Yeah, it sounds like just a bunch of this substance is being created in mass under the city. Yeah, we should get everyone and go back down to the sewers, the train station. It seems underground."
"Kingston: Hey you, in the chair, you said you have a, you know where this is coming from?"
"Bazathrax: Yeah, yeah. I've been snooping around all night. You know, taking a look around. I can lead you to it, yeah."
"Cody: My dark lord, what if people just started calling me ambassador of the dark lord and you would like not come out and you would just like talk to me in my head?"
Bazathrax: What's that?
"Cody: Dude, why don't you like, get the fuck outta here, and you can just talk to me in my head and tell me where shit is, and I could just be ambassador of the dark lord?"
"Kingston: Cody, this is a hospital. You can't smoke in the hospital. I'm sorry."
Cody: [quiet] Fuck. [throws down his cigarette]
[Brennan laughs]
"Murph: It's just like, when it's his roommates, I feel like he's like an asshole, but as soon as like an adult tells him to do something, he's like, ""Fuck."""
"Kingston: Hey, thank you for putting that out. I appreciate that. Thank you."
Cody: Fine.
"Brennan: You see, Pete, with that incredible Intimidate check from before, you feel like you could probably, at least momentarily, like imprison Bazathrax within Cody so he's not like getting up to trouble."
"Pete: Hey, Cody."
Cody: I fucking beg you. Yeah?
Pete: I'm about to do something really metal for you. Are you ready?
Murph: I bend a knee and pull my sword out.
Ally: Can I take Bazathrax and turn him into a chest piece tattoo for Cody and just slam him into his chest?
Brennan: A million percent.
"Ally: I turn him into a chest tattoo that says ""redemption,"" and it's dripping in blood."
[cast laughs]
[brief metal riff]
Murph: Cody never smiles and just like keeps trying to not smile.
Cody: [struggling not to smile] This is awesome. Thanks.
He reaches a hand up to his mouth.
"Pete: Hey, are you okay, man? Are you having a stroke, or?"
Murph: No one has ever been this happy.
"Cody: This is normal fucking stuff, and I'm just doing my job. Thank you."
Brennan: Oh my gosh.
"Pete: For sure, man, I got you."
"Brennan: You can feel Bazathrax burning inside this incredible tat that has been made by the Vox Phantasma himself of New York slamming this like raw dream magic into your chest that is now this dripping Gothic font. You hear Bazathrax in head say,"
"Bazathrax: Oh, shit. What the fuck, dude? Aw, goddammit."
"Cody: Well, okay Bazathrax, we're gonna have to fucking work something out because you can't just talk whenever you want. You need to like tell me shit, not just say like, 'What the fuck is going on in here,' because that's going to get, you're going to drive me fucking nuts, man."
Brennan: Cool. I'm going to say that you're not sure how to talk in his head so you do have to talk out loud.
[Murph and Zac laugh]
Brennan: Your half has to be out loud.
Murph: I'm just freaking out.
"Brennan: Yeah. You see, he goes,"
"Bazathrax: All right, dude, look, I'll help you out, okay? Look, there's a confluence happening on West Fourth Street by Washington Square Park, West Fourth subway station. That's where I saw it, okay? If you guys head there, that's what you're gonna find it."
Murph: All right. I relay that to the crew.
Ally: Let's do it.
Lou: Great.
Ally: We text everybody.
Lou: Exactly.
"Kingston: Wherever Sofia and Ricky can meet us, we'll meet, and the new person, you guys know who the new person in the group chat is?"
Sofia: Her name is Madam Anastasia. She's the most honest person I've ever met.
"Brennan: So, Iga. You, you head and you have your box. You meet up with Ricky and Sofia as they are taking like the L out of Brooklyn to go meet up with everybody else at West Fourth Street. On your way to this thing, I think, Iga, you're probably just getting swept up in it by virtue of like talking to these people. What do you say to Ricky and Sofia as you meet up with them?"
"Iga: Oh. Oh my goodness, Mr. March. It is truly just such an honor to meet you."
Ricky: Former Mr. March.
"Iga: Oh, yes. Well, yes, but the forever Mr. March in our, in our hearts."
"Ricky: Thank you. Thank you. I might be making my own calendar, but I'll let you know if it happens."
"Iga: Oh, w-wow."
Ricky: Yeah.
Iga: That's amazing.
Ricky: Maybe it was supposed to be for just private.
"Sofia: Yeah, I was going to say, I think as someone who's friends with Esther, I can't see that calendar."
"Ricky: Yeah, maybe I'll... We'll talk about it. We'll give you an answer. We'll talk. Sorry, nice to meet you."
"Sofia: Madam Anastasia, what is going on with this box that you're telling me about?"
"Iga: Yes, so..."
[slightly suspenseful music]
"Siobhan: Nobody but us could see it on the train anyway, right? 'Cause it's only people who are inside the Umbral Arcana."
"Brennan: If you made it full-size, everyone would think you just had a lot more suitcases than they thought."
[Emily laughs]
"Siobhan: Okay, great. So, I like elbow people out of the way on the subway and then make it big."
Brennan: Whoom!
"Iga: Okay, this, it's hard, it's, okay it's a little hard to describe because you didn't see it before, but this used to be just trees, and if you look at that's for sure, you, and that's for sure you on the bunch of buildings."
"Sofia: Oh my god, I’m gorgeous."
Zac: Can we see ourselves on it?
"Brennan: You can see two figures. This is like an ancient, medieval like Eastern European, kind of moss-covered in parts, chest. It looks like something that some ancient pagan warrior god would have had in their like, giant castle in a fairytale somewhere. And instead there are still trees carved into it, but now there are skyscrapers, and they look and feel ancient to the touch. And you see that there are two figures on top of one of the skyscrapers that look like a broad-shouldered man and a woman with like high hair swept back in a ponytail from her head, gazing heroically off into the skyline of these skyscrapers."
"Sofia: Madam Anastasia, you've been so direct with me already, and I'm sorry to ask for more honesty from you, but what does this box mean to you? What do you keep in it? How does it change sizes?"
"Iga: Oh, I... The box, we do not open. We do not open the box. I had a great- great-aunt. As a little girl, she opened the box. Who knows, she’s gone."
Ricky: So it's sort of a big haunted box you keep in your bedroom?
"Iga: I don't like haunted, I would say more it's a box of power that a powerful spirit resides inside, and..."
"Sofia: You have children, right?"
"Iga: It helps out our family. Yes, I have two children, and my daughter when I’m done..."
Sofia: How do you make sure the children don't open the box?
Iga: They know not to open the box.
Sofia: Okay. Okay.
Ricky: Feels a little like we should maybe take a few more precautions with this box.
Sofia: Put some locks on the box.
"Zac: Ricky's gonna cast Divine Sense to see if it's, to detect good or evil."
"Brennan: Powerful magic. Not divine, not fiendish, not fey, not undead, but something of a category like those things that you've never detected before. Give me a Perception check."
Emily: Can I do one as well? I guess I probably wouldn’t—
Brennan: Yeah. Give me a Perception check. Calling DC 20.
Emily: I only got a 10.
"Zac: I got, 13 for me."
"Brennan: Cool. You guys look at it, and yeah, your Divine Sense tells you that there's some powerful magic to this with a type of being like those other things but not those things. Feels deep and primeval."
"Sofia: So Madam Anastasia, was it communicated to you what your, that, you know, did your parents say, 'Watch over this box? Never open it? It is the task of our family?'"
"Iga: Yes, pretty much that. Yeah, those are all the things that were said. It's been passed down from mother to daughter for generations."
Sofia: Mother to daughter. Interesting.
"Iga: Yeah, always mother to daughter. I don't know. We always have one daughter. She's the one that takes the box. It's sort of an inevitability. I don't know. It's..."
Siobhan: I shrink the box back down and put it back in the bag next to Misiek and give Misiek a little bit more drink.
"Brennan: You guys transfer trains to go down. You take the C one stop down to West fourth, and as you merge on the platform, Kingston, Ricky and Pete, meet up with Iga, or sorry, Ricky, Sofia, and Iga meet up with Cody, Pete, and Kingston."
"Iga: Hello, Kingston."
Kingston: Hey. Hello. I was wondering if it was this Madam Anastasia.
Iga: How you doing?
Kingston: I'm good. How are you?
"Iga: Yeah, good. Yeah, pretty good."
Kingston: Interesting. I haven't seen you interacting with the Unsleeping City.
"Iga: You know, I tried. It's not my business. It's your business. I don't try to get involved, but, you know, sometimes maybe we can help each other out a little bit, you know."
"Kingston: Hey, this is true. This is true. Good to see you all."
"Cody: Hey, what's up, everybody? I am the ambassador of the dark lord, formerly the “Night Angel”, AKA Cody."
Ally: I Mind Link with everyone while he's talking.
[Emily laughs]
"Ally: I'm like, look anyway, like explaining, but nodding next to you like."
Emily: I'm nodding based on what Pete is saying and not listening to Cody.
Murph: I just like keep going on.
"Sofia: Interesting. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Powerful. Wow, wow."
"Cody: Yeah, so like Bazathrax is like, he's a manager, but corporate is Lucifer. So I work for Lucifer."
"Iga: Wait, what is your name? What's your name?"
Cody: The ambassador of the dark Lord.
"Iga: No, no, Cody?"
Cody: My name is fucking Cody. God!
"Iga: Okay, thank you."
"Kingston: Do you want us to call you Cody, or do you want us to call you something else?"
"Cody: [quieter] You can call me, you can call me Cody."
"Pete: Dude, he goes by 'Night Angel.' I don't know why you're being so shy, man."
"Cody: Well, now I'm the ambassador of the dark lord."
Ricky: He said Cody.
"Pete: Dude, you're a lot of things, and they're all badass, okay? Cody’s a cool name."
"Sofia: If you wanted to, you could just tell us which one you prefer."
Cody: Cody's cool. You can just call me Cody.
"Sofia: Okay, Cody."
"Kingston: Great, Cody it is."
Zac: Can I tell—
"Sofia: Kingston, how do you know Madam Anastasia?"
"Kingston: Oh, I mean, I just know most people, and, you know, she's been around, has chosen to, not be as involved, and I respect that choice, but it is nice to see her today."
"Brennan: Kingston, you feel a, a sharp pain. A sharp pain in your chest. If you were going to guess what it was, it'd be like a, some kind of like maybe a muscle spasm or maybe something else, but you feel sharp pain in your chest."
"Lou: Being in this group, I think I do my best to hide it. Just kind of like, be like,"
"Kingston: [holding his chest] All right, well, let's, ow, ah, let's, let's get to it."
Brennan: Give me a Deception check.
"Lou: Great. That's gonna be, wow, that's only a 12."
"Emily: What would that go up against? Our passive perception, or?"
"Brennan: That's your passive Insight, so anyone whose passive Insight is 13 or higher, Pete, yeah, you notice something's wrong with Kingston."
"Siobhan: Oh, yeah. Mine as well."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: I clock it, but I don't call him out on it, but I want to ask him later."
"Brennan: Kingston, you begin to hear whispers coming from one of the empty rails. You guys are on the platform in between the local... You have like the local train stopping on one side of the platform, the express on the other. Looking down one of the express lanes, Kingston, you see this woozy thing of the subway extending down there, and for a moment, all of you stop, like seeing certain things. Like Pete's little green butterfly like flickers out for people. Everyone kind of sees Misiek, the little sick looking dragon in Iga's bag, kind of turn into a chihuahua for a second like, and the tunnel extends. Kingston, you begin to hear, sort of like a,"
[eating noises]
Voice: Move over. I said fucking move. Why are you always like this?
[demonic-sounding gibberish]
"Voice: Yeah, I said it, he wouldn't know."
Voice: I'm not giving up my seat.
[laughing] [demonic-sounding gibberish]
"Brennan: And you see through a haze of like a heat wave, a train approaching the station, and you get this powerful sense of New Yorkers wailing out. And this is not articulately put, but you just know this is a bad train."
"Kingston: Hey, everybody, this next train. This is not articulate, but it's a bad train."
"Ricky: Whoa, did you just come up with that?"
Sofia: That sounds kind of fun to me. I like that.
"Cody: Do you wanna just throw a fucking rock at it, or?"
"Kingston: No, it's not the good bad. It's the bad, bad. I might, I'd be ready for something."
"Brennan: You guys see the train pulls into the station. As it starts slowing down, you start seeing it's filled with commuters, but it's also sort of flashing in and out of, it seems like somehow more or less normal than usual distorted somehow. As it gets very, very slow, the train is like looking at it's about to stop, and then you hear over the PA it being like,"
"Announcer: My mistake, this train is going express. Not making this stop. Not making this stop at all!"
Emily: I jump on it.
Ally: Can we try to make it stop? Yeah.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, Sofia you can leap to the very back."
"Emily: Cast Jump on myself, and jump on it."
"Brennan: You can leap to the very back car of the train. Actually, all of you can. It's starting to pick up speed again, but if every one of you guys wants to leap to the back of the train, you absolutely can."
Zac: Let’s do it.
"Lou: Yeah, let’s do it."
Murph: I do a running jump onto it.
Brennan: You run and jump on.
Emily: I'll reach my hand out to help anyone.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: I try to pick up Cody.
Cody: What?!
Ricky: I got you!
"Ally: Can I cast Cold? Can I cast like Cone of Cold to like freeze its gears and like keep it there, or does it seem like I don't have time?"
"Brennan: You can definitely cast Cone of Cold. It would potentially damage the car itself, but you could definitely do it to slow it down for a moment to let everybody like leap onto the train."
"Ally: Nah, we'll just leap. I think we'll make it."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: I'm gonna use my Elemental Gift and fly.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Iga just takes off flying off the ground. As the train begins to pick up, you hear that voice say,"
"Announcer: [increasingly maniacal] That's right, ladies and gentlemen, this train is making all express stops. In fact, just one more stop. The end of a line! (laughing)"
"Brennan: You guys leap. So trains like this have conductors, sort of like stations at both ends of the train. You guys bust through the door on your end to see this conductor's area has been completely destroyed, smashed apart, rent asunder, and as you open the door to look in, you see a bizarrely empty subway car with people crowded around the doors. You see that the people crowded around the doors are crowded because there's a bunch of just fucking spaced out people who are not moving further into the car. They're just like on their phones or reading and like leaning against poles and shit, like, and there's all these New Yorkers that are trying to get to seats that they can't get to because these people won't move further in. Kingston, as you see this, this is like a shot to the heart of like, [[clapping for emphasis] you. don't. do. this."
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: And you realize this entire train is flooded with antipopuli. There is a magical substance here. This train car is filled with a spiritual force, gleefully shredding the most basic and fundamental laws of how you are supposed to behave on the subway. And as you recognize that, all of you see the people flicker, the people that are stuck disappear as the train car morphs into a train car with the floor as grass and stone gravestones everywhere. And you see those people that are not moving further into the car just like spaced out, not being considerate, not paying attention, rotting flesh hangs from these zombies as indeed you pass by the station of everybody here on Halloween. I'm going to need everybody here to roll initiative."
Lou: Yeah!
[cast members cheer and whoop]
"Brennan: That's all for this episode of the Unsleeping City. Tune in next week as a very Halloweeny subway car filled with monsters, all engaging in the rudest acts of New York subway etiquette imaginable. Join us next week for episode three of the Unsleeping City."
[cast members eerily laugh like ghosts]
Ally: Wow.
"Emily: Oh, Kingston, nice Halloween costume."
"Lou: Oh, yeah. Full on dressed like a pirate through this whole fight."

(upbeat music)
"Brennan: Hello one and all, welcome to another exciting episode of the unsleeping city season two. I'm your humble dungeon master Brennan Lee Mulligan and with me as always are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: [high-pitched, spooky cackling] Happy Halloween for indeed it is All Hallow’s Eve! In the great city of New York, and on the hustling and bustling subways. All know the fanfare and revelry of the big apple during Halloween. Yes, many go out in their sexy versions of normal uniforms and costumes and some really artsy people do things that you’re like, wow, that's really an incredible piece of art. Like that's a mechanical wonder like, I knew a guy one time who just went as a chair and he had a stool built into the costume and when he sat down, it just was like a chair in the street. So that's pretty cool."
Emily: Could you sit on him?
"Brennan: Yes, you could sit on him while he was sitting on himself."
[Emily and Siobhan laugh]
"Brennan: Such wonders await in the Unsleeping City, where our intrepid heroes leaped onto the back of a rattling A train bound north for one final terrifying destination. The end of the line, as the conductor of the train announced over the squeaking PA in a ruined cockpit at one end of the train, you open the doors to see a crowded subway car filled with..."
"Yes, people in costume. There's a pirate and a superhero and a Dracula and other various things but those."
Emily: Another pirate?
Lou: Another pirate?
"Brennan: Another pirate, like Kingston. But those were not the people that you had to worry about. Because indeed, it was the people not in costume. Some, you know people on their way to some dreary event or other commuters people working the grind people in the rat race, just standing slack-jawed and lackadaisical, not moving further into the subway car, an act of pure malice, manifested by the presence of antipopuli, pure misanthropy in spiritual form that seems to have suffused every inch of this terrifying runaway subway car. We come now to battle, we have rolled initiative, and we are going to leap right into it. First things first, we jump now into Roll20! Oh my goodness gracious. And we see here..."
Siobhan: That’s a long map.
"Brennan: A very long map. But if you zoom in, you'll see where all your tokens are in the very upper left hand corner right here and we're going to go ahead and remove the roof here so that you may see ahead of you into the car itself."
Lou: Wow.
Siobhan: Whoa.
"Brennan: You see a vast and terrible subway car stretching out ahead of you and you see the zombies that now await. The reality of the train car flickers and you see that yes, on the surface level, this was happening here in reality, but you are all I mean, Pete, you know immediately that something is happening, Nod is being pushed out into the waking world by the presence of this antipopuli, this primordial oozing hatred for the norms and customs of the city of New York. And the subway car in front of you erupts where the benches erupt into tombstones, you're in kind of a mausoleum, a graveyard, if you will. And you see these groaning shapes of these people with no care or consideration for their fellow passengers turn their heads. The passengers who were themselves trapped, do not appear to be here any longer or if they are here, they're back in the waking world while all of you are caught in a pure bubble of dream energy, and only these subway etiquette malefactors remain. First to act in our initiative order, Vox Phantasma himself, Mr. Pete Conlan, Pete."
"Ally: [sighs] Well, okay, um, I, what is my movement again? Good lord. Okay, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna run straight ahead through that door right here."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, boom."
"Ally: Okay, cool."
"Brennan: And by the way, the cells of this battle are actually not five feet wide. They're actually three and a half feet wide because New Yorkers know how to fight with less space on a crowded subway. And we wanted to be more accurate to the actual width of subway cars."
Zac: Wow.
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: Um, so Pete, you rush forward to where that first zombie lurches."
Ally: Yes and I would like to cast Dispel Evil and Good and break enchantment on that first zombie if I can.
"Brennan: Hell yes. So break enchantment would help a possessed creature. Dismissal is a melee attack [quickly reading spell description] on a hit, you attempt to drag a creature back to its home plane, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw. So do you want to do the ismissal function of Dispel Evil and—?"
Ally: I guess can I tell if this is a New Yorker who has been possessed or if this is just a full creature itself that I could use dismissal on?
Brennan: Give me an Arcana check.
"Ally: Oh, yeah. 17."
"Brennan: Um you feel that you are interacting with an element of the real life people that is itself misanthropic and tainted. So in other words, you don't think that hurting this entity would hurt the real life person attached to it, you are effectively attacking that person's misanthropy and active disdain for their fellow New Yorkers made manifest within the dream realm."
"Ally: Okay, um, so then I guess I'll do that dismissal."
Brennan: Hell yes let's go ahead and—
"Ally: And for that, I'm gonna actually use my teapot. So it looks like I just sprinted forward and poured myself a little cup of tea, but then I like forced them to drink it. Weaponized tea."
"Brennan: Incredible this is a Charisma saving throw from a zombie. Not great, gang. Oh, this creature has a minus three to Charisma. It needs a natural 20 to make the save. Close on the die, that's a 14. Um, Pete, you leave forward into the train. Whoo! Tea surrounds you, [burbling] down the gullet of this zombie. [imitating explosion] That comes apart and the spiritual malignance of this person is shunted out of existence as the corpse deanimates and collapses into bile and goo on the ground in front of you."
Zac: Whoo!
Lou: Yeehaw.
"Brennan: Yee fucking haw, gang."
Murph: So rad.
"Brennan: That is rad as hell, Kingston that's going to be you."
"Lou: Uh, okay, as I like walk into this like subway car, can I make a Perception check to see into the next subway car or is that impossible?"
"Brennan: Give me a perception check, man."
Lou: That's gonna be a 22.
"Brennan: 22, you do see into the next subway car but on a 22 I'm going to make you choose between seeing the dream realm version or seeing the waking world version?"
"Lou: Oh, great question. I'd like to see the waking world version."
"Brennan: You see, there is a large family of tourists, like a group of families on kind of, they're wearing the same t-shirt, they have whistles and fanny packs and the dad of the family is loudly announcing to the group of tourists."
"Dad: [panicked, Midwestern-sounding] Gang, we got to be safe here, okay. If you put your arm in that subway door, it's gonna take that arm right off okay, I've seen it happen, okay? This is your first time coming to the city, you got to watch out, you gotta be careful. I want you to keep your eyes on your buddy and stay around. Don't talk to any of these fucking people!"
Brennan: That's what you see in the next car.
"Lou: Great uh, that needs to stop now. I'll charge right into like this, this throuple of zombies right here."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Lou: And can I cast Turn Undead?
"Brennan: Ooh, I would love it if you did! So yeah, Pete leaps out, teapots this one zombie and Kingston you rush out past your buddy Pete, your fellow Vox of the city, enter this group of zombies. Go ahead and let us Turn Undead."
"Lou: So they all make a DC 15 Destroy Undead so if they fail, they just die? They're instantly destroyed. Excuse me, they don't die, they're instantly destroyed."
Brennan: Oh my god and the range on that is 30 feet correct?
Lou: Yes.
Zac: Nice.
[impressed whistle]
Brennan: Holy shit.
Ally: Did that reveal some more people coming out?
"Brennan: CR one or lower, let's go and check this out here."
Lou: What's the CR?
"Brennan: What is the CR indeed? Um, hold on one second."
"Lou: This feels like at the Olympics when they have to check something. It's like, well maybe we're gonna win— This is the difference between a gold medal for me and not a gold medal."
"Brennan: Um, okay, let's roll these Wisdom checks. The DC on these is I believe 17 correct?"
"Lou: You don't have to believe, you can know, you can know that it is 17 in your heart."
"Brennan: How wise are the zombies, they're a little bit wiser than they are Charismatic, but not by much. These guys need 19s or higher to make the save. That's a 2 a 6 and a 14. Kingston, what do you say as you stride into the middle of the zombies lurching towards you?"
"Lou: I like I think I just walk forward, lift my token aloft and I'm like,"
Kingston: This only works if we are kind to one another.
Lou: And shine.
"Brennan: All of those zombies erupt in lights, full like our opening of the Ark of the Covenant. They like exalt forward, their mouths open, pure street lamp light blasts out of their mouths, and they all three of them are unmade in that instant around Kingston Brown."
Lou: There we go.
"Brennan: There we go, let's get it done, incredible. Well, gang, that would have been the zombies’ turn. But there is one zombie left in the car actually with a speed of 20 feet."
Lou: He can dash if he would like to.
"Brennan: [laughs] Yes, we are going to go ahead and this zombie right here is going to move and dash to close with Kingston Brown. [groaning] With no action left as it charges you. That is going to be Cody “Night Angel” Walsh."
"Murph: Cody is so amped. This is just, a sword guy just finds out magic is real. He is in the movie Underworld and he is happy."
[Zac and Emily laugh]
"Murph: He's going to charge down, I guess get like like run past Pete and over by Kingston here, and he's going to point at the zombie and go,"
"Cody: I am the ambassador of the dark lord, I command you to chill."
Murph: And I'm going to use Channel Divinity: Control Undead. Has to make a Wisdom saving throw or else I gained control of it for 24 hours.
Emily: 24 hours!
Zac: Wow.
"Brennan: This zombie rolled a natural 18, which is a 16."
Murph: Fuck!
Brennan: Does 16 make the save?
Murph: Yes.
"Brennan: So you go, I command you! You see the zombie goes [groans] and just checks its smartphone again real quick and seems somewhat distracted."
"Cody: Fucking pay attention to me, fuck."
Emily: So perfect that your first act of magic failed.
"Murph: I just, I look at Kingston and I look at Pete, I go,"
Cody: I don't give a shit.
"Kingston: Hey, it’s alright."
"Sofia: Hey Night Angel, are you sure you made a deal?"
"Pete: You did, okay, you did fine."
Cody: It's fine! It’s fine. [quietly] Fuck.
"Brennan: Um, incredible. That is now going to be a Sofia Lee, First Fist of the Order of the Concrete Fist, let's go."
"Emily: So okay, can I see through, so this space in between this car and the next car, right? Is there a point of dim light in there?"
"Brennan: Um, do you mean it, connecting this last car with the second to last car?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Um there, actually, no, I mean there's no light so that is the sort of darkened external connector portion between the two cars. When you go through one door, you're temporarily like, you're, I mean, you're you know, you're riding in between the two trains, but you are technically like outside and it's in darkness."
"Emily: Yeah. Okay, so I basically, um. I need to be within 60 feet so I'll walk forward like two squares."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: And then I want to teleport there, then use the rest of my movement to reveal what's in, to enter the next car."
[Brennan smacks his fist into his hand and points excitedly]
Emily: Reveal it and I still have my attack.
Lou: [waving his hand] Rrrrrah!
Brennan: Hell yes.
Emily: That uses my bonus action but now I can attack—
Ally: We’re a little different from last season.
Lou: What’s up? Just a little.
"Brennan: Hell yes. Sofia, you got it. Go ahead and teleport to the space in between cars and you will see what happens in that car with the aggressively anti-local tourists in the next car."
"Emily: Okay, so she basically like moves two steps forward so that she can see through and then she teleports 60 feet here hanging on, hanging onto the door and peek it and like kicks the door open to see what the fuck is happening in there."
"Brennan: Hell yes. Yeah, Sofia."
"Emily: Use a stiletto heel to make, to make the door move."
"Brennan: Sofia you leap into the car you guys see Sofia, who has mastered this new Way of the Shadows. [whoom!] You appear completely riding with one foot on each of the two cars as it pitches forward. This car is going probably upwards of 90 miles an hour. [imitates whooshing] Stations are screaming past you as this express train takes off northbound. You look in, see those tourists going."
"Tourist: [panicked yelling] Look out! Jimmy, I want you to stay away from that man. Nobody touch anything. Oooooo!"
"Brennan: And everything, the dream world bubbles up with this toxic miasma of hatred and misanthropy, fear and misunderstanding and you feel yourself flash into the dream world this is some shit that like normally only Pete is able to do, and it appears to be happening not because Pete is commanding it but like to the entire physical location you are in. It really does feel like something being pushed or squeezed out into the waking world. This probably triggered something in Sofia in terms of all the shit she has been reading about. This feels... Actually go ahead and give me either Arcana or Religion if you want and you can go with advantage."
Emily: Okay.
"Lou: Ooh, go with advantage."
"Emily: Which is better, they're the same. Okay, I did poorly. I got a 7."
"Brennan: 7, cool. This is fucked up and you're about to fight on this train but some crazy shit is going down."
"Emily: You know, I've been reading a lot about this right now but right now I'm just, kind of feel cool for surfing the subway."
"Brennan: All of those tourists, like all the people that they are bothering by loudly talking about how dangerous and bad this city is. All of those, the people listening vanish, and that family just starts going. [groaning yell] And a group of ghosts wearing fanny packs and baseball hats appears in a green ectoplasmic translucent subway car directly ahead of you. You have movement and your action left."
"Emily: I do have movement, so let me, I'm going to enter that car. I think I only took like seven feet of movement before so I can definitely get to. Let me see I could run up to this square right here so that I could potentially attack both of them. Can I do that? To try to and I'll take an"
opportunity attack from this one ghost.
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely go for it."
Emily: Okay.
"Zac: I mean, it's frickin’ Halloween in here."
"Emily: [laughs] I do, can I do an Insight check to make sure it's not just cute children dressed as ghosts?"
Brennan: Go ahead and make an insight check yes.
"Emily: Okay well, I did get an 8, so."
Brennan: You're pretty sure these are some spooky damn ghosts.
Zac: Uppercut a nine year old.
"Brennan: Yeah, it's gonna take a swing at you. Bada boom, that's a nat 20 to hit."
[dark music fades in]
"Sofia: It's fine, sometimes getting hurt makes me stronger."
Brennan: Ha ha.
Emily: Literally mechanically.
"Brennan: Let's do it. That's going to be some heavy necrotic damage coming Sofia's way. That is 3, 6, 11, 17, 19, 23, 25, 28 points of damage to Sofia as she leaps forward into the subway car."
Emily: Damn it it almost got me down to get my thing.
Brennan: To get your radiant?
"Emily: Yeah, um, I take it uh, I'm disappointed it wasn't more and I then I'm gonna go I'm going to attack this one directly in front of me. Since after I Shadow Step, my first attack after I Shadow Step is with advantage. Does a 25 hit?"
Brennan: 25 sure does hit.
"Emily: Okay, so that is 10 damage but I'm going to try it but I'm going to spend a ki point to Stunning Strike."
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: And see if I can stun the ghost.
"Brennan: Cool, Stunning Strike is a Wisdom save, what's your DC again?"
Emily: 14.
Lou: Stun the ghost.
"Brennan: 14\. The ghost, the ghost, oh, but incredibly, these ghosts can be stunned this one makes it save."
"Emily: It makes its save, okay."
Brennan: Absolutely insane that these guys can get rocked so hard that they get like flummoxed and dazed. Spectral entities.
"Murph: Just imagine decking Casper and Casper goes, “Oh, my bell.”"
"Brennan: “I need to sit down, dude. You fucking rung my bell, I gotta sit.”"
"Emily: I might go stun him then stun another one, but I will attack him again."
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
"Emily: That's definitely gonna hit, that's a 26, so that's another 8 damage and I'm going to... no I’ll save it. No, why save it? I'm going to try to stun him again."
Brennan: Hell yeah. How much damage have you done over those two attacks?
"Emily: Um, I did 18."
Brennan: 18\. Hell yeah. And gonna make another save for being stunned.
"Emily: Actually, you know what? I'm not gonna try to stun him again. My plan was to try to stun multiple ones, but if I failed I'm gonna save my ki points. Thank you though."
"Brennan: Sofia, you leap past one, you can feel the searing cold the necrotic damage as one goes like,"
"Ghost: Oh my god, that woman is running on the subway!"
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: And you leap forward and pow! Uppercut this ghost. Boom! Haymaker again and injure one of the ghosts there in that second car. Next in the initiative order is our dear friend, Ricky Matsui, that's you."
"Zac: Tight. I think Ricky looks at Cody's chest and sees the “redemption” on it and realizes,"
"Ricky: Oh, yeah, I feel like I should have mentioned this before, guys, but since I lost the questing blade, I took it as a sign that I probably shouldn't try to hit people so much. So generally, I don't know. I'll do it if I have to but avoiding that. Just throwing that out there."
Kingston: Alright.
"Sofia: Oh, okay."
Ricky: Just sort of a new path I'm on.
"Kingston: Go ahead, Ricky."
"Brennan: Hell yeah as Ricky says that, um, yeah, you guys see this sort of holy light covers Ricky. I also forgot. There actually, it is not Ricky's turn. It is about to be Ricky's turn, however, in the first car something else does happen."
Lou: No!
"Emily: Oh no, I thought I was helping everyone by revealing the next one."
"Lou: Hey, no, take backs, dude, you said it was Ricky's turn and Ricky did his whole thing."
Siobhan: It seems like it’s Ricky’s turn.
"Lou: Yeah, I feel like you dropped the ball here."
"Ally: Yeah, Ricky did his whole thing."
Siobhan: Nothing in the rulebook that says you can just make shit up.
Lou: His whole thing.
"Zac: Oh, I didn't even notice but I love Pete's mustache."
"Ally: Yeah it's new, it's new baby."
"Brennan: Pete's mustache is very, very good."
"Ally: Yeah, he's got a mustache and a caesar, he's really, he's ready."
Siobhan: He’s living that life.
Lou: A mustache and a caesar.
"Brennan: Boom, boom, boom, boom."
Lou: What?
"Brennan: Skeletons erupt from the stony floor of the subway car [crashing] as they, [bone rattles] horrifying commuter skeletons to join their zombie brethren, and they are going to rush forward."
"Iga: See, this is why I don't get involved. It's just messy, you know? I just mind my business. No skeletons."
"Murph: I think just, Cody thinks all of this stuff is rad so he's literally looking at everybody else's faces to see if the skeletons are good guys or bad guys."
[cast laughing]
Pete makes a “no” gesture.
"Cody: Yes, shit, fuck, yes."
Brennan: Okay.
Pete: They’re bad.
"Kingston: They're bad, they're bad guys, come on now."
"Murph: I look at Pete,"
Cody nods excitedly at Pete.
"Ricky: Cody, we aren't on those specific skeletons’ side."
"Cody: Right, yeah, I know."
"Pete: Skeletons in the future, you never know."
Brennan: All of these skeletons rush forward and are going to take swings at Kingston Brown.
Lou: [pointing at himself] [in a higher voice] Me?
Brennan: At you.
Lou: Why?
Brennan: Because you just iced three zombies in one action.
Lou: [normal voice] Sure.
Ally: [laughs] When you put it like that.
"Lou: I can't blame them, I can't blame the zombies."
Brennan: Incredible. That's going to be the zombies taking their swings.
Emily: Are they zombies or skeletons?
"Brennan: Oh sorry, these are the skeletons rushing forward."
"Lou: Also one zombie, right?"
"Brennan: There's still one zombie left, yes, absolutely. Only one of the skeletons manages to land a blow for 6 points of damage to Kingston Brown."
Lou: Oh no.
The Roll20 icon spurts blood.
"Emily: Aha, look at you bleeding!"
Zac: Bleeding!
Ricky: Kingston!
Kingston: It's not that bad.
Brennan: How's Kingston looking as the undead descend on him in a subway car?
"Lou: 80, still at 80. It's a scratch."
"Sofia: Just so everyone knows, the ghosts hit for actually quite a lot more."
Kingston: Okay.
"Sofia: So, like ready yourself for that."
"Brennan: Um, as you all surge forward, um, Ricky, a different kind of light shines around you not the bright and glaring civic light of your firefighter self from three years ago, but a gentler, warmer, kinder and softer, more radiant light as you now tread the path of redemption. You are a different kind of hero now, and you feel the power welling up within you and it is your turn."
"Zac: I guess Ricky’s looking at these skeletons, can I make a check on them? Like, can I tell if it's like an Enchantment or..."
"Brennan: Give me either a Religion, or I guess you can do Religion, Arcana, or Medicine depending on what you're trying to figure out about."
"Zac: I'm wondering if it's like a charm or frightening like, or a charm or enchantment, so I guess I'll do, can I do Medicine?"
"Brennan: Oh, yeah, do Medicine for sure."
Zac: Nat 1.
"Brennan: Um, uh, you got no— these bone dudes are scary and mean, and they're trying to hurt your friends."
"Ricky: These guys aren't great, well—"
"Zac: And also, can I go if Ox is moving? Movement is 60 can I make him take a dash and go 120?"
"Brennan: You absolutely can and that does not use your movement. Ox, though he is a sweet dalmatian and Ricky is not riding him in real life, functions as Ricky's paladin steed. So when you are running alongside your dog, you possess a superhuman speed born of your enthusiasm to keep up with your canine pal."
"Emily: Brennan, there's nothing you can say that will not make me picture Ricky riding the dalmatian like a horse, okay."
Brennan: Goddammit!
"Lou: I agree, very much agree."
Ally: You gave it an honest effort but there's just no way.
Lou: Good try. Great try.
"Brennan: Unfortunately, Ricky, here's the issue: you cannot move through these enemy squares at the moment."
Zac: Damn.
Brennan: At least because they're fully blocking the subway car.
"Zac: Okay, well, I would love to, so the one in front of Kingston is still alive?"
Brennan: Mmhmm.
"Zac: Okay ah, great great great. Okay, Ricky and Ox will try to move from here to here."
"Brennan: Yeah, great."
"Zac: Okay, so just move us over here."
"Brennan: Dope great. You rush up oh, yeah you got 2 skeletons in front of you right now."
"Zac: Mmhmm. You know, I don't feel great about it, I know literally what I just said, but."
Emily: [laughing] This is so funny.
"Cody: I know what you're saying, dude, that skeletons are fucking rad as hell and you think your whole life that you're gonna serve the Dark Lord when you finally do you end up fighting skeletons in your first fight? It's fucking bizarre, but we have to do what we have to do."
"Ricky: Cody, I'm gonna put in the work to get to know you. But right now, I gotta be honest, that's not exactly where I'm coming from."
"Zac: I will just, I'm just gonna cast a, gosh, I'm going to hit the skeleton in front of me with a punch and see what happens."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and make an unarmed attack. Go ahead and roll."
Zac: And for that. I only got an 11.
"Brennan: Only got an 11. Gotcha. And you're adding your Strength and proficiency, right?"
Zac: To the hits?
"Brennan: To the to the attack roll, you should be adding."
"Zac: Nine, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I think I believe you should be adding plus nine."
"Zac: Okay, so that I rolled a 2, so I, 11 on the first one. I'll just roll one more attack."
Brennan: Go for it.
"Zac: Jesus Christ, a 13."
Brennan: 13 hits.
"Zac: Okay, and so for how do I calculate unarmed damage again, is it just—"
"Brennan: Unarmed damage is gonna be your strength plus one, but you also can smite here if you want to."
"Zac: Yeah I will okay, so I'm automatically doing six damage I'll just do a level one smite and just sort of like. [bops the air]"
"Brennan: Level one smite is actually gonna be 3d8, cause these are undead."
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan So go ahead and roll 3d8.
"Zac: Cool. 1, 2… Alright. Jesus, only eight."
Brennan So that's 8 plus 6 is 14.
Zac: Yes.
"Brennan: These guys have 13 hit points. Um, here's the thing it's up to you. I don't know that this is necessarily even violent, I think this is Ricky just literally laying a glowing hand on this skeleton and it just goes to rest."
"Zac: Yeah, I see the skeleton and like this is,"
"Ricky: Hey, buddy, maybe just hang out somewhere else maybe you take a break from this."
Zac: And I just touch his forehead.
"Brennan: The skeleton just sorts of leans into your hand in that way of like, dude, thank you for offering the support and perspective that I needed to make the right choice, [imitating clattering] and the bones clatter down to the ground, and the skeleton is disanimated in front of you."
"Ricky: See you later, friend."
Brennan: What's Cody's reaction to that as he sees it?
"Cody: Yeah, I think we might be on different paths of redemption. Do you need to borrow a sword?"
"Ricky: Um, gosh. It sounds—"
Cody: Cause I have a bunch.
Ricky: Swords are cool. I think swords are cool.
Cody: Cool.
Ricky: But I also am feeling like swords are not for me right now.
Brennan: Um Iga that is going to be your turn.
"Iga: Well, it seems to me like everybody's got this sorted out you know I don't Oh, gosh okay, I, fine I will hit. I will do an Eldritch Blast right at this zombie. Get this zombie out of the way."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: That is a dirty 20. For my first one.
Brennan: Dirty 20 hits.
"Siobhan: So that's 4 plus 9, so 13 damage for the first one."
"Brennan: 13 does not finish the job, but cleaves into this zombie for sure."
Siobhan: And then my second Eldritch Blast is a nat 1.
Brennan: Oh no.
Emily: Aww.
Brennan: But you dealt 13 points of damage you said?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: What does Iga's Eldritch Blast look like?
"Siobhan: Um, I think it looks fake. Like it looks like maybe she's shooting like a firework from her hand."
[Lou laughs]
"Siobhan: Like it's, it’s like a good magician's firework."
"Brennan: Pew! Bottle rocket streaks out. Incredible, and we are back to the top of the order. That is Pete."
"Ally: All right, I... So we're not able to pass through here, it's too congested."
"Brennan: It's too congested at the moment. If you have creative ways of doing it, teleporting, other modes of movement, go for it. I, you know, it's not impossible, but you can't just straight walk through those enemies right now."
"Ally: Ah, okay. Uh, okay, I am going to cast Fireball using a, burning a couple of sorcery points to use Careful Spell."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: So I can pick some creatures to be safe from that.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: So I'm just gonna cast Fireball kind of like, do we see if there are any new skel— I'll just try to get all of these people, all of these guys, these four."
Brennan: Dope as hell. Go ahead and roll damage for Fireball.
"Ally: All right, I'm gonna do... let's see. [quietly] Which level… [normal] Oh, I guess I'll just keep it at a, at third okay. Dadadada…"
Lou makes finger guns at the screen.
Ally: 44.
[Brennan sputters in disbelief]
Murph: Good lord.
"Lou: Sick, sick, that's cool, that's real cool."
Brennan: 44.
"Ally: I probably still say like,"
"Pete: Hey, guys, look out!"
"Ally: But I'm definitely casting like Careful Spell,"
[Zac jokingly screams]
Ally: So that like when flames go up nobody gets hurt.
"Brennan: Roiling dream fire. Just swirls of green and purple and blue flame erupt from Pete's hand. You're like in the mix as well protected by your own Careful Spell. [imitating fire roaring] Yeah, Cody, this is, you're seeing some wild shit here, man."
Cody raises his hands and revels in this cool shit.
"Brennan: All three skeletons, the zom, and the remaining zombie are incinerated, gone."
Ally: Hell yeah.
Lou: Hell yeah.
"Zac: After Pete's turn. I don't know if you're done yet, Pete, sorry, but could I use Ox's movement to get up to the second car?"
"Brennan: Ah, ooh. Um, I'm gonna say I'm gonna say you can on your next turn ‘cause Ox had to stop his turn with you in the initiative. But on your next turn, you'll be able to tear off for sure. That's Pete. Kingston, that's you."
"Ally: Oh, I'm just gonna move at the end of that, but that's all."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and move your piece. You have 30 feet of movement."
Ally: Let's see.
"Brennan: Hell yeah and Kingston, what are you doing?"
"Lou: Great, Kingston is going to use the new, uh, charge through the roiling dream flames of Pete and I'll take a full dash into the next car, which I think is just about 60 feet for me to get to like right here, and I think I'll slam over, I'll slam over one spot."
Brennan: Hell yeah dope.
"Lou: Oh, yeah, that's it that's right about 60. See, I'll use a dash action to get into the second car and be within eyesight of, make eye contact with Sofie."
"Sofia: Hey Kingston, what's up?"
"Kingston: Hey, this is."
"Sofia: Yeah, oh, it's ghosts they do like a lot of damage."
"Kingston: Oh, great. Oh, a new flavor, great. Well, well listen. Everyone's coming, we, the last car’s done, this one's the new business."
"Sofia: Okay, good good good."
"Brennan: Cody, that's you, baby."
"Murph: Sweet. Cody, is gonna do a full dash following Kingston, passes Pete and goes,"
Cody: Nice job on the last one. I’ll handle this one.
(cast bursts out laughing)
"Murph: Naruto runs full speed to get up to the ghost, does not run fast enough, super winded when he gets up there."
Cody: Fuck!
"Murph: And that is gonna use a bonus action to Compelled Duel on one of the ghosts that is going after Sofie and goes,"
Cody: [pointing] I am your opponent.
"Brennan Incredible what's, is that a Wisdom save on that?"
Murph: That is a Wisdom save.
Brennan: Hell yes.
Lou: “I am your opponent.”
"Brennan: Um, this ghost fully believes you."
[Murph laughs]
Brennan: And let me tell you exactly what it does about it.
Cody: Fuck!
"Sofia: Wow, thank you, Night Angel."
"Murph: [laughs] Bows deeply,"
"Cody: Don't thank me. Don't get used to it, we're only allies for now."
"Iga: Wait, is it Knight Angel with a K? Or with a just N."
Sofia: That's a really good question.
"Cody: That's super interesting, because both are super fucking cool. You guys,"
Murph: I’m just yelling through the car.
Cody: You guys can just call me whatever cool shit you want.
"Kingston: Okay, Cody."
"Sofia: Yeah, I’m going to call you Cody."
Ricky: I'm gonna call you Cody.
"Iga: Yeah, Cody seems to suit you pretty well."
Sofia: Cody works.
"Brennan: Okay, I'm gonna need Cody to give me a"
Murph: Cody is fully the same level as everyone else I don't know why he sucks.
[Emily laughs]
"Lou: Hey, he doesn't suck he just hasn’t had an opportunity to shine."
"Emily: Yeah, he just got his powers."
Zac: Did you ever think you'd be playing a D&D character named Cody?
[Murph and Emily laugh]
"Brennan: Um okay, um, Cody, here's what you see happen. This goes that you did the Compelled Duel. Looks at you and goes,"
"Ghost: Ah! Look at him, he's a satanist! [screams]"
Cody: You’re damn fucking right.
Brennan: And leaps at you and attempts to jump into your heart. Give me a Charisma saving throw.
Lou: What?
"Emily: Wait a second, when that, if that ghost ran away from me wouldn't I get an opportunity attack on him?"
"Brennan: You absolutely would, go ahead and give me an opportunity attack."
Lou: As he went to jump into Cody's heart.
"Emily: Okay, I got a 17."
Brennan: 17.
"Murph: This is, I literally because of my Auras, and because of having proficiency in it because I'm a paladin, I have a plus 12 and I just rolled a 3 so I only got a 15."
"Brennan: Okay, Sofia, you hit on that roll?"
"Emily: Yeah, so I hit for um, I hit and this is the ghost that I already attacked."
Brennan: Yes.
Emily: So I hit for 12 more damage.
"Brennan: Ooh, awesome. Okay. And what do you get on your saving throw, Cody?"
Murph: 15.
"Brennan: You roundhouse kick, bam! This goes as it flies past you. It rushes towards Cody and what do you get?"
Murph: 15.
Brennan: 15 makes the save.
Murph: Yes!
Brennan: Incredible.
"Lou: Oh, thank God."
Brennan: This ghost attempts to possess you.
"Cody: You can't possess me, I have no heart."
"Brennan: Pfft. I'm also going to need a Wisdom saving throw from Sofia, Cody, and Kingston. Wisdom throw from Sofia, Cody, and Kingston."
Emily: Okay.
Lou: Here we go.
"Murph: Anybody who's within, I think, is anybody within 10 feet of me?"
Brennan: Kingston is.
Lou: I am.
Murph: Kingston is. You get plus 4 to the roll.
"Lou: Hell yes, Cody. Okay."
Murph: I got 5.
Emily: 14.
Lou: I got a 25.
"Brennan: 14, 25. What'd Cody get?"
Murph: 5.
Brennan: For real?
Emily: Cody.
"Murph: Yeah, I'm not wise, believe it or not."
"Lou: Oh, Cody."
Murph: That's my dump stat.
Brennan: Cody I'm gonna need you to roll a 1d4 for me.
Murph: Oh no!
Lou: Is there anything I could do as this is being--?
"Brennan: There is nothing, you and Sofia are fine, you and Sofia."
Murph: 2.
"Brennan: Cody, you age 20 years."
[Emily and Siobhan laugh]
Lou puts his hand over his heart. Zac covers his face.
"Emily: [laughing] This kid’s life! In the course of the fucking day, he made a deal with a bad devil, tried magic for the first time, failed."
Cody: What happened?
Emily: And aged 20 years.
Lou: And he's now a 40 year old man.
Brennan: He's a 46 year old Hot Topic manager.
[Emily squeals in laughter]
Ally: Oh my god.
Emily: I didn’t think he could get any more tragic.
Zac: This doesn't even have to do with the fact that he sold his soul. This is just a separate thing that happened.
Cody: You think that rad shit is gonna happen when you find out that magic and devils are real!
"Kingston: Hey, there’s— We could do something about that, all right? There's a, there's a magical thing that we can do, just keep going."
"Cody: Cool, I feel tired."
[All laughing]
"Brennan: I don't know if, you're a paladin. Can you be affected by the frightened condition or no?"
"Murph: Oh, interesting."
Brennan: Double check if you can.
"Murph: I think I can't, I will double check that."
Zac: I'm immune to being frightened. That's Aura of Courage.
"Brennan: If Cody has Aura of Courage, then he should be okay if he doesn't."
Zac: I don't know if he would though.
"Brennan: You have Aura of Protection and Aura of Hate. Oh, no, you do have Aura of Courage. “While you are conscious you and friendly creatures within 10 feet can't be frightened”. Okay, so you are not also subjected to the frightened condition as one of the ghosts near Sofia just rends its face with this elongates its mouth and It's horrifying jiggly jello moan, goes [moaning] and you age. Kingston and Sofia you know you've fought undead before so you know to like not look directly at a ghost while it's doing something like this."
Pete: Don't give it any attention.
Cody: How am I not supposed to look at cool shit?
Kingston: It’s not cool shit!
"Brennan: God, that is so fucking funny."
Pete: Cool shit?
"Cody: Oh, I suddenly can't handle my diet of just Pizza Hut. Oh!"
"Brennan: Also, Cody, you take another 10 points of necrotic damage"
"Murph: Cody is just barfing everywhere because he had like four Monster energy drinks today. He was like coming out of his 20s, like still having like a teenager's diet and is just falling apart right now."
Cody retches.
Siobhan: Blowing chunks all over the subway.
"Sofia: Kingston, Kingston. Confirm for me. This is some of the craziest shit you've ever seen right?"
Kingston: I've been doing this for 20 plus years. This is the wildest shit.
"Sofia: Okay, cause I’ve only been doing it for a couple years."
Kingston: You missed the part where Pete pushed a devil into his chest. That also happened to him today.
Sofia: Oh? Okay.
Cody: That part was awesome. That part was awesome. I'll sell my soul to anybody who can fix me.
[Emily and Brennan crack up]
Brennan: [laughing] “I’ll sell my soul to anybody-”
Cody: I’ll trade it!
"Brennan: You hear, you hear Bazathrax in your chest be like,"
"Bazathrax: Dude, you can't fucking trade, dude, it’s not yours anymore."
"Cody: [voice going up in pitch] Then fix me! You're the manager, fix me! When I was the manager and something bad happened with an employee, I had to fix it. You have to fix this."
"Bazathrax: Dude, I don't know how, why is your body so much less comfortable now? Everything's slow, what's going on?"
Cody: I don't know.
"Sofia: Cody, maybe you can get out of the contract because the conditions changed. Because now you're an older man."
Cody: I just gave my soul freely forever.
"Brennan: Bazathrax yells out,"
Bazathrax: Tell her there's not like too many clauses in this contract. There's not a lot.
Cody: I can show you the contract. It’s on half a poster.
"Sofia: Please do, I love paperwork now."
"Brennan: Incredible. Sofia, the attack that just swiped across Cody for 10 points of damage, you duck and avoid just such an attack from the ghost next to you. Instead, Sofia's turn."
"Emily: Okay, I think that do I have this sense that um, do I have the sense that it was the sound of this ghost that this ghost making this sound is what made Cody age?"
"Brennan: Yes, you do sense that."
"Emily: Okay then I might cast, I think I'm going to cast Silence around me and these ghosts."
Lou snaps his fingers repeatedly.
"Brennan: [gasps] Oh, so fucking cool."
Emily: So that they can't try to do that on anyone else.
Lou: Yes.
"Emily: Ah, that's my action. Is there anything I can do to try to keep them in this? It's a, hold on, I've never cast this before, because I just saw what happened to Cody, I don't want that to happen to anyone else. Ever."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: Um so that it's going to be a 20 foot radius sphere.
"Brennan: Um, dope. Um, so 20 foot radius sphere, absolutely. You have a bonus action left, you can't flurry because you haven't taken your attack action but you do have Hexblade Curse, you do have Patient Defense."
"Emily: I guess I will do Patient Defense and well, I kind of want to get hit again so I yeah, I'm gonna Hexblade Curse is only once a day, I think that I'm going to sit tight, I'm going to sit tight and try and be a physical barrier so they can try to so they can't run out of this 20 foot radius and I shout— oh wait! Before I cast it, before I cast it, I say,"
Sofia: I'm gonna make things real quiet around me so try and shove these ghosts in here and then we can have a real quiet fight with them.
Emily: And then I descend into a 20 foot radius.
"Brennan: Sofia summons with her ki a radiant moment, a bubble of pure New Yorker solitude, the ability for like a New Yorker to like literally be in a subway getting like smacked in the head with someone's bag repeatedly over and over again and still just be like in their mind thinking about their day, [vwoom] fills a 20 foot radius around Sofia with pure silence. [imitates magic energy] As that happens, Ricky, that's going to be your turn."
Zac: Gotcha.
"Brennan: Um, and now you got Ox's full movement."
"Zac: Okay, with Ox's movement, could I carry somebody?"
"Brennan: I'll say yeah, if you want to you can carry somebody, go for it."
"Ricky: Excuse me, my new friend in the back of the car."
Iga: Mm? Yes.
Ricky: Would you like to go forward? Could I offer you a ride?
"Iga: I would yes, please thank you I'm just sitting back here like what can I even do? I'm so slow."
"Ricky: We'll figure it out, ma'am."
Zac: Ricky and Ox are going to double back and pick up...
"Brennan: Iga and Misiek, cool."
"Zac: Iga and Misiek at the back of the cart. And that would be, let's see."
Brennan: Like 15 feet to them.
"Zac: 15 feet to them and Ox is dashing so that's, he has 105 left."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: So from back there going 105 from here.
Brennan: Yeah it would be.
"Emily: Yeah, come here and then you guys won't be able to won't be able to hear even if they scream."
"Zac: Oh, gotcha."
Brennan: Gotcha cool. You can make it all the way to Sofia with Iga with no problem.
"Zac: Okay, cool, I'll do that."
Ally: So this is a little dragon in a woman's hands in your hands on top of your dog.
"Brennan: Yes. Rather, it's what everyone is seeing is Ricky picks Iga up and just bounds down the subway with Ox going [imitates dog barking[ bouncing off after him."
Emily: While riding the dalmatian.
Siobhan: An absolute dream.
Ally: While riding the dalmatian.
"Zac: Ohh, man."
"Brennan: Ah, the first ghost that you go past takes a swing at Ox misses by a mile."
Zac: Okay. I do a double take at Cody.
Cody: What? It’s weird!
"Ricky: Oh, shit, dude."
"Cody: I look pretty much the same, right?"
"Ricky: Were you this age the whole time? Was this, did they knock your—"
"Cody: Who the fuck are you, man?"
Ricky: I'm gonna figure you out. I'm gonna figure you out.
"Cody: I look like the fucking guys in Green Day, man."
"Brennan: Um and Ricky, you have, you have your full movement and action in that second car."
"Zac: Okay, uh, Ricky is going to step next to, walk up to this guy right here, can I stand right there?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can jump up on the seat, it's no problem."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: You're fighting it's like difficult terrain, but you have plenty of movement to make it there."
"Zac: I'm gonna cast, I don't have Protection from Evil and Good, but I think I should so next fight I'll figure that out. I'll give Sofia a Shield of Faith."
Sofia: Thank you.
Brennan: Lovely and that's just a bonus action so you have an action left.
"Zac: Oh, right I will. God, what am I gonna do?"
"Brennan: These are still undead so your, your like Lay to Rest smites don't, don't necessarily, they work pretty well on these dudes."
"Zac: It's it's totally just Ricky just like, it's like you're watching someone do like an escape room puzzle that's dumb. And he like, he feels that he shouldn't fight things, but is also trying to figure out how to work around it so yeah, I'll just try to Lay to Rest smite the guy in front of me."
Brennan: Go ahead and make an attack roll.
Zac: Okay. Nat 20.
[cast ‘ooh’ing in appreciation]
"Brennan: Oh, my god."
Zac: He's gotta be dead.
"Brennan: Yeah, well."
Lou: He’s gotta be dead.
"Brennan: It's gonna be, your unarmed strike does no damage to this ghost but if you're doing a first level smite, that's going to be 6d8 damage to this."
"Zac: Oh, yeah. 6d8. So, 6, 9, 8… so 23 damage to this guy."
"Brennan: 23 damage, hell yeah. Yeah, you hit this ghost or just you touch with your first hand, deal 23 points of radiant damage to this ghost."
"Zac: I'm gonna say,"
Ricky: Be at peace.
Zac: And touch it in the head.
"Brennan: Um, this ghost is still up, but you do have another attack left?"
"Zac: Um, oh, yeah, I'll just attack it again."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: 18 to hit and I will Divine Smite again.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Zac: And that's normally 3d6, 3d8, right?"
"Brennan: Normally 3d8 because it's normally 2d8 for first level, these are undead so it's 3d8."
"Zac: Uh, 9. Really bad rolls over here."
"Brennan: This ghost is still up as you lay these like glowing hands. Just trying to like, not even harm just like restrain this ghost he's going,"
Ghost: Don't touch me oh my god we just wanted to come and see the M&M store.
"Ricky: It's not, it's just M&M’s."
Ghost: We don't have those back in Dayton.
Ricky: I have to disagree. I just have to disagree. You might not have a whole store but.
"Brennan: Iga, that's gonna be you."
Siobhan: Ooooh. Can I do a Perception check to look through the little windows here to see what's in the next car?
"Brennan: Yeah, make a Perception check."
"Siobhan: Great. Well, that's a 4."
Brennan: You don't see shit.
"Siobhan: I don't see shit, okay. Well, but I'm assuming that there's bad stuff in there. Is there a way that I can grab Cody but be further than 10 feet away from Kingston? To touch Cody while being more than 10 feet away from Kingston?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Um, no."
"Siobhan: Okay. In which case, I'm going to say to the one in front of Cody. I'm gonna cast Suggestion on that ghost and I'm gonna say,"
"Iga: You know, I'm sorry to interrupt you, I think I heard your kids say that they were thinking about moving to the city to study performance art? They said they loved it here and they also want to lick the subway pole."
[cast laughing]
Iga: So maybe you should go deal with that instead of these people.
Brennan: Hell yes. This ghost just rolled for its Wisdom save. Does a 15 pass your DC?
Siobhan: My DC is 17.
Lou: Yeah!
Murph: Nice.
Ally dances.
Brennan: Oh no. So the ghost right in front of Cody is the one is the one you’re looking at?
"Siobhan: It's the one that, the one that aged him 40 years 20 years."
"Brennan: You see that ghost goes,"
"Ghost: [ululating] Jason, we talked about this you were gonna go to a state school and then come help with the store!"
"[Siobhan, Emily, and Murph laugh]"
Brennan: This ghost screams. This Suggestion has fully worked on it.
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: Incredible.
"Siobhan: So yeah, on his next turn I would love for him to attack that guy. I don't think I have anything that I can do as a bonus action."
"Brennan: Cool. Pete, that's you."
"Ally: Okay, I would like to take a full dash."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: So that is...
Brennan: 30 feet. It's like right into the train car.
"Ally: 30\. Oh, that's a dash."
"Brennan: Well, that's a movement but you can double that if you want to yeah."
"Ally: I'm gonna do double it, baby."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, catching up."
"Ally: Up here I think, can I go right past?"
"Brennan: Yeah, that guy already used his attack of opportunity."
"Ally: Amazing and then I'm actually going to use um, let's see here quicken spell to use a fifth level banishment, so I can banish two people."
[Brennan gasps]
"Ally: So I'm gonna banish the one next to the one that Siobhan just Suggested, and then the one in front of me when I land here."
Brennan: Fuck yes! Awesome.
"Zac: The one that's not hurt, or the...?"
"Ally: Yeah, the one that, whatever one's not hurt."
"Brennan: Oh my god, very fucking cool. Charisma saving throws DC 17. Let's see what these ghosts have got in the tank."
Lou: What these ghosts got in the tank?
Ally: What do they have in the tank?
Lou: How much gas these ghosts got in the tank?
Brennan: A natural 4 and natural 2 is not much.
[various ‘yeahs’]
Ally: Get the fuck out of here!
Brennan: Is this the ghost diagonally from Sofia or directly in front of Sofia?
"Ally: I guess diagonally, right?"
"Emily: Yeah, that’s the one that hasn’t been hit."
"Brennan: Yeah so the two upper ghosts in other words, not the suggested one but the ones closest to the wall. Both of those ghosts [snaps] vanish in a blink you see them get sucked straight into Nod. They are back in the Sixth Borough, gone from the train."
Ally: Sick.
"Brennan: You're still maintaining concentration on Banishment, though so careful because if you take a lot of damage, they might come back."
Ally: Okay. Do I just keep rolling for Wild Magic? Is that still—?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. You've been casting a couple spots but I think yeah, give me two rolls for these spells. So roll number one for the, for the Fireball and then another one for this one."
"Ally: Okay, it was a d100?"
"Brennan: Oh no, d20."
"Ally: D20 oh duh, of course. It's a 9. That's a 6."
"Brennan: Cool. Now, now you're at one two and three give you a wild magic surge. Awesome. Um, that's Pete. Kingston, that's you."
"Lou: Can I do a Perception check for two things. One, what's in the next car and two just the general sense I have or around the like, a meet like, this end that the train is headed to? What is the sense I get around that and how much time we have before that."
"Brennan: You feel that you probably have at most like three or four rounds before you get the end of the line, this express train is rocketing, and the end of the line it's going to crash and kill everybody on the real life train unless you can stop the dream element of it right from destroying that. give me a Perception check for the next car."
Lou: That's gonna be 23.
"Brennan: 23 and I'm going to keep it on the waking world. In the next car you see a bunch of people like peering and being like, like really looking like oh God, as there's a dude hunkered down right near one of the doors, who's got open street food in his lap and is just eating a full set of wings and like dipping sauces like balanced on his knee and like touching the pole with like grease on his hand,"
[Ally and Siobhan groan in disgust]
"Brennan: Just like messily eating. And you can tell he opens some kind of thing of soup that he's like, he's having like soup and wings at the same time and you can it's like very clearly homemade and pungent. Just eat, having a full like multicourse dinner of like balancing wet foods on the subway."
"Lou: Great. I think I shout to everyone else and I'm like, hey, also a weird like map thing that I'm trying to figure out. Do we have to, is that, this, this car in front of our like tokens the final car, or is this like a, it's been spread over three lines?"
Brennan: It's been spread over three lines.
"Zac: Oh, shit."
Lou: Great. I shout to everyone.
Siobhan: We have a lot more to go.
Brennan: You have a lot more to go.
"Kingston: We have a lot more to go and maybe not more than three or four minutes to do it. Let's, let's hoof it."
Emily: Okay.
"Lou: I'm gonna go a full 60 dash into this guy in front of me is gone, right? He's been banished?"
"Brennan: Oh, the guy in front of you is banished, the other one has been Suggested to leave and won't take an attack of opportunity. One of them is going to get a swing on you as an attack of opportunity and miss."
"Lou: Great. Yeah, it's 60 feet for me to get into the next car, so that's what I'll do. I charge like down the road, cut in, and make it here, wherever’s here."
"Brennan: You charge into the next car and the car with people being like,"
"Commuters: Oh my god, why is that guy eating so many like complicated, wet foods, like wings are the one of the— like there's so many foods that are gone once you're done eating them and wings are not one of them. There's wings with the bone and the bones are all left."
"Brennan: You go in and Nod bubbles up and you're in a dark forest and you see gazing up where that guy eating the wings [snarls, screams] was a massive werewolf, blood drenched, eating like a human arm. [snarls]"
"Kingston: Okay, all right yeah, yeah, okay, we got this."
"Brennan: Incredible. Cody, that's you, baby."
"Murph: Oh man, Cody is—"
"Emily: Not baby, middle aged man."
Brennan: Middle aged man.
Lou: No longer 26.
Murph: Cody is frazzled. Okay.
Ally: Cody’s 46.
Murph: Cody is 47.
Emily: [laughing] I want this to be permanent for some reason.
Zac: [laughing] 47.
"Murph: Okay, so Cody is going to take his now very sore body and he is going to Naruto run a little slower than before. With exactly 30 feet of movement, he can get up to this spot."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: And he has not shown himself yet, so he's gonna go all out and he does whisper that to himself, that he's going to go all out just this once."
[Brennan laughs]
Murph: He is going to bonus action cast a Thunderous Smite.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: So starts glowing with lightning energy.
Cody: Just please let me fucking hit.
"Murph: And then I'm going to Great Weapon Master to take minus 5 so that just I can fucking whale this thing. I’m just, going like full fighting game, huge sword with lightning, swing down and hope that I hit."
"Brennan: Alright, let me know what you roll."
Emily: I want this for you so badly.
Murph: I only have a plus 3 to hit now.
Emily: What?!
Murph: But this is just simply what Cody would do.
Emily: I want this so bad.
Murph: [pumps his fist] Nat 20!
All: [cheering and clapping] Yeah! Yes!
"Murph: I swear to God! I swear to God, can you see that, can you see that? [moves his camera down]"
The die does not show up because of the virtual background.
[talking all at once]
"Brennan: Yes, oh my God."
Emily: No because of the green screen.
"Siobhan: No, we can’t see anything because of your background."
"Lou: No, we cannot. We cannot see it."
Murph: God damn it.
Brennan: The virtual background.
"Emily: I believe you, I believe you."
Murph: Do you see my nat 20?
Brennan: We cannot see it. Oh my God that is so fucking funny.
Emily: We were all like praying for you.
Murph: I can't believe it.
Ally claps.
"Brennan: Okay, add up your Thunderous Smite, if you're doing a Divine Smite now, go for—"
Murph: I'm also going to do a Divine Smite.
Brennan: Go for it.
"Murph: Okay, so I'll do first level Divine Smite and then the Thunderous Smite and then I get plus 10 for Great Weapon Master. I truly can't believe that worked out for me."
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: And Sofia, just so you know you're on deck next, because the urgency of these trains are pushing the fight forward."
"Emily: Yeah, I'm going to just start speeding forward."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: I would’ve done that had I known.
Murph: And then for smites... 6d8 because it's undead and I crit.
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Murph: Jesus, this is awesome."
Ally: Hell yeah.
Murph: Cody completely forgets that he's not 27 anymore and that he lost 20 years of his life.
[Brennan and Emily laugh]
Murph: Umm. [doing math] I rolled so many ones.
Siobhan: There's those Murph rolls.
Emily: It's still gonna be a beautiful hit.
Zac: You don't have Great Weapon Fighting do you?
Murph: I do!
"Siobhan: Oh yeah you crit, you go again."
Zac: You can reroll those ones.
"Murph: Yeah, hang on."
Ally: Incredible.
"Emily: Oh, that's true if you have Great Weapon Mastery you get to..."
Siobhan: If you crit with Great Weapon Master.
"Emily: Oh, but you're probably using a bonus action for smites already."
"Murph: Yeah, one sec, okay. [doing math] 67 damage. [laughs]"
"Brennan: My God. Cody runs up. Cody has a bad back. Your duster does not really fit correctly, but you just. Your shirt explodes in flame along with your new chest piece. You bring the buster sword overhead. The roof of the subway will not allow this. You shear like scissors through fabric through the roof of the subway overhead, nail the ghost into the floor of the subway such that there is an explosion of fire and light. The ghost shreds into ectoplasm, disappearing into the now visible wheels and undercarriage through the hole you made in the floor of the subway car. Bwah! In the distance. [train wheels rattle, something screams]"
Cody: I understand now. I had to pay for 20 years of my life to do something that sick. It was worth it.
"Sofia: Honestly, age looks good on you."
Cody: Thank you.
Brennan: Incredible.
Murph: I still have another attack.
Brennan: Oh yeah.
Murph: I am out of movement. I can't see anything else right?
Brennan: No.
"Murph: There's nothing in that forest, cool."
"Brennan: Oh, actually yeah, you can see a werewolf under the tree."
"Murph: Sweet. I'm gonna chuck a ninja star just into the, halfway into the other train."
Brennan: Give me an attack roll.
Murph: That one is a 22 to hit.
"Brennan: 22 hits, baby."
Ally: Woo!
Murph: That one is just 7 damage.
"Brennan: Um, it pings. Your non-silver replica like, like magazine-bought ninja star pings off of the werewolf's hide."
Werewolf: Rawr!
"Brennan: Um, and, uh, Cody, you have smoked a ghost into the bowels of the subway and then hucked one of your like machine press ninja stars into the next subway car. Uh, Sofia, that is you."
"Sofia: Okay, I just need to take the temperature of the group. It seems as though we need to get to the front of the, of the train as quickly as we can we are quite far from it. I may leave you all to try to get to the front of the train. Does this sound okay?"
"Pete: That sounds great, that's a great idea."
"Emily: I would like to look through into this, I'm assuming that since this is a forest there's some dimness in here."
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Emily: Okay, so I'm going to Step of the Wind 60 feet into here. So I go to that spot and then I'm going to do a full dash action."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: And go 90 more feet.
Ally: Ooh!
"Brennan: Incredible. Um, werewolf is going to get an attack opportunity on you."
"Emily: I have, what is Shield of Faith?"
Brennan: It gives you a plus 2.
Zac: Plus 2 to AC.
"Emily: Okay, so I'm 21 AC right now."
"Brennan: That is a miss from the werewolf, you can continue to move through the car."
"Emily: Okay, so now I'm going to go 28 feet to the next car."
Brennan: And now you're actually in that second car in the second line.
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: So we'll go ahead and move you there and I'll describe what you see as you enter that car and I think you make it part of the way into that one.
"Zac: Oh, I see. So that the one with the tree is the same one with the tree right there."
"Brennan: Yeah, the one with the tree is the werewolf one. How much more movement do you have when you exit the werewolf car?"
"Emily: When I, so I used 28 movement when I got in there so 90 minus 28."
Brennan: You have like 60 feet of movement left which is awesome.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Incredible. You make it all the way to that next car, you can probably get through that car if you need to."
Emily: Yeah I will.
"Brennan: You walk into a car that as you see the waking world version of it, you see that there is a... this is a an emotional turmoil car, there is a loud couple breaking up publicly in the corner of the subway. Just sort of weeping and talking to each other about how things fell apart. There is another guy sitting in a subway car just pointedly trying to befriend someone reading with headphones in."
[all laughing]
Emily: This car is so funny and I really want to stay but I gotta fucking get to the next one. Take your opportunity attacks.
"Brennan: Incredible. Amazing. That, the people turn into to kind of like modern day, modern day vampires into like a lustful millennial vampire relationship and the dude trying to befriend a stranger becomes Dracula as you rush through here, amazing. They're gonna take some swings at you. Your AC right now is 21."
Emily: 21 sorry.
"Brennan: 21\. Okay, one of them I believe is going to hit."
Emily: Shield.
Brennan: Huh? Shield.
Emily: Shield.
Brennan:Hold on one second.
Emily: 27 AC.
Brennan: 27 AC.
Zac: Absurd.
"Emily: Sorry, 26."
"Brennan: 26 yeah, doesn't get the job done to hit to hit Sofia. You sprint through there that is Sofia's. Do you have any movement left? That's Sofia’s turn."
"Emily: Yeah yeah, I still have 60."
Brennan: Oh Jesus.
Emily: Cause I used 28 to get into this one and now I can use my 62 left to get into this next one.
"Brennan: Go ahead, get into the next car my God."
"Sofia: I mean, you know, if Kingston says it's important I gotta believe him.."
"Brennan: Hey, you guys see Sofia in her magical Louboutins van— just like full on, Sofia gets halfway down the car and then just horizontal flying side kicks through both doors, blam blam! into the next car."
Murph: [crosstalk] Sofie runs as fast as Cody thinks he does.
"Sofia: Just so everyone knows, the car I just left looks really funny."
Siobhan: What is this? Why is there a—
Zac: A headless horseman!
"Brennan: It's a headless horseman. You got the next one. Sofia you see the waking world bubbling away in this one. There is a dude who, it is perfect weather outside. It is not raining, and a dude uh, and this car is this this train line is not crossing any rivers where it is right now. And some dude has brought his enormous bicycle on the subway. Has it positioned blocking off a number of seats from where people could sit down if they wanted to and it erupts into a colonial haunted tavern where the Headless Horseman with a flaming pumpkin in his hand gazes down at you. I believe now Sofia is out of movement yes?"
"Emily: Now I'm out of movement yep, I've used every single thing I can do."
"Brennan: Amazing. Now that werewolf is going to bound towards Kingston, does so. [little snarl] Let's see here, it's going to hit with its bite attack. Kingston takes six points of damage."
"Lou: Oh, c’mon now."
Brennan: And I am going to need a Constitution saving throw.
Zac: Before you do that could I channel divinity and use rebuke the violent and it's within 30 feet.
"Brennan: Yes you can do that, what does that do?"
Zac: Force the attacker to make a Wisdom save.
"Brennan: Okay, rolls a natural three, Ricky, Rebuke the Violent works."
"Zac: Okay, wait, sorry, I may have actually read this wrong. On the failure the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage just dealt. Okay, so it still hits him."
Brennan: Gotcha. Yeah still hits him but takes six points of radiant damage. What does Ricky say as this thing hits him?
"Ricky: Please stop. Reconsider, friend."
"Cody: Ricky, no, I finally understand it. We are vampires and these are our natural enemies."
Ricky: That's also Underworld.
Cody: Have you ever seen Underworld?
"Ricky: No, I've seen Underworld, I have."
"Cody: Wait, in Underworld they all kind of end up getting along and there's bad guys in the, this is all it's been a confusing day."
Ricky Yeah.
Brennan: Kingston I'm gonna need a Constitution saving throw from you.
"Lou: Great. If I fail, do I become a werewolf?"
"Brennan: Yes, you do."
Siobhan: Oh my god.
Lou: Is it that simple? Is it really that simple?
Brennan: It's truly that simple.
"Lou: Okay, that is 18 plus 7."
"Brennan: You're, you know Kingston got his lycanthropy vaccination back at St. Owen’s."
"Lou: Of course, dude."
Brennan: He stays up to date on those.
"Lou: I stay up to date but I can take that six, that six is fine."
"Brennan: Incredible, that is the werewolf's turn. Sofia I'mma need a Dexterity saving throw."
"Emily: Dexterity saving throw, okay."
Brennan: DC15.
Emily: Okay. Okay. It's gonna be a 25.
"Brennan: Instead of taking an enormous amount of fire damage, as the Headless Horseman goes,"
Headless Horseman: [laughs maniacally]
"Brennan: You barrel roll, Olympic gymnast twirl in the air spread out on the ceiling as this pumpkin head explodes on the ground underneath you taking zero damage."
Emily: Because of my monk Evasion.
"Brennan: Incredible, this, the Headless Horseman charges, attacks, and you're still under the effect of your Shield spell."
"Siobhan: Yep, so it's still 26."
Brennan: Misses twice.
[cast cheering]
Sofia: Don’t fuck with Sofie Bikes.
Ally: We're killing it!
"Brennan: You're like holding on to the bars as the train is going 90 miles an hour and just blocking this like Hessian, colonial-era saber and the horse hooves with your feet."
"Emily: I think I need to try to sooth the ego of this creature that just missed so much on me, I say,"
"Sofia: Just so you know I think my personal life just took a serious nosedive last night. I may have seen my husband for the last time. So I may be thriving in my career, you know, but."
"Brennan: You see, the Horseman, uh, the Headless Horseman appears to hate the degree of empathy and grace you are extending to him."
Sofia: Just so you know.
"Brennan: Incredible, Ricky, that's gonna be your turn."
"Ally: Oh, can I say can I turn to Ricky and Iga and say,"
Pete: Can you guys hold your turns for after mine because I have something that can definitely help you.
"Ricky: Yes, I can move pretty far but, and kinda want to help Kingston out. Is there, uh."
"Ally: I think it goes you, Iga, me right. So could you hold then it would be your turns again?"
"Zac: Cool, yeah."
"Brennan: You actually could you guys can organize your turns kind of however you want. You could even use movement to like, get into the next car if you wanted to and all, and all sort of be together there but yeah, Ricky, Iga and Pete can all coordinate cause you all kind of have the same initiative."
"Zac: I think my only thing was without planning too much is like, I want to be able to cast something near Kingston before I leave the area."
"Ally: Yeah totally. Oh, yeah. I'm not gonna send you anywhere."
"Zac: Okay cool yeah, I'll wait for you."
Ally: Awesome.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Ally: Cool. I just dropped down and I, I'm petting— Wait, what's, sorry, what's your dog's name again?"
Zac: Ox.
"Ally: Ox, right. I kneel down and I'm like,"
Pete: Who's a good boy?
Ally: And I pet Ox and I cast Haste on Ox. So his movement is doubled.
"Brennan: Incredible I'm gonna let you know that will break concentration on Banishment, which means those ghosts will come back if you cast haste."
"Ally: And I don't have anything that can hold a second concentration, right, that's Fantasy High."
Brennan: Yes.
"Ally: Okay. Uh, I think that's fine we can just start running from the I mean, if you have that much movement, I doubt they could find us."
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
Siobhan: Book it.
"Brennan: Um, dope. How many people are you casting Haste on?"
Ally: I think I can only cast it on one with this.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: So I'm just gonna cast it on Ox and then I'm gonna take a, I'm gonna dash up to Kingston."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, rock and roll."
"Ally: And that's my turn, thanks for letting me go first."
"Zac: Hell yeah, thank you."
"Brennan: Ricky, that's going to be you."
Zac: Okay with from here.
Brennan: Now Ox has his speed doubled to 120 and gets an extra movement every turn.
Zac: Hell. Yes. I'm going to use Calm Emotions on the werewolf. So each humanoid in a 20 foot radius must make a Charisma saving throw.
"Brennan: Sorry, just a heads up, Calm Emotions is also concentration. So you will break Shield of Faith on Sofia. Cool, gotcha."
"Zac: I think that's worth it right now. I'm gonna break the concentration on that and use it to make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile towards. That would end if people attacked it or any of its allies near it, but would just like to make it indifferent to our party."
Brennan: A natural 5 on the saving throw from this werewolf.
Ally: [whispering] Yes.
Brennan: What does Ricky say as he approaches the werewolf?
"Ricky: My sweet pup, listen. You just chill here. We'll get all this sorted out and then, you know, you can go play outside or something. How does that sound?"
"Brennan: Ah, you see, it looks at you in your serene chillness and Ox comes up and licks the werewolf on the end of its nose. And you see that there is a tree root which you recognize is one of the like side benches of the subway car. And the werewolf just goes over and plops itself down to take a seat, having been understood and reached out to with empathy and kindness."
Zac nods.
Ally: Aww.
"Zac: And then can Ox grab me and— God, I keep forgetting— Because I keep wanting to call Siobhan's character Anastasia, but I’m really—"
Brennan: You guys all know her as Anastasia.
Iga: You can call me Anastasia.
Ricky: Anastasia!
Zac: Can I get Ox to carry us both as far as we can go forward?
"Brennan: You could have cast that spell kind of as Ox was carrying you carrying us through. So you're, you have your full movement. So Ox right now has a speed of 120 and if he uses his action to dash can go a full distance of 360 this turn."
"Ally, proud of their work, grins widely, hands in front of their eyes."
"Zac: Fuck it, let's do it."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Let me measure, I'll measure this. So to the end of the werewolf car, that's 90. Then, um, 120 for the next two cars. So 90 plus 120 is 210."
"Zac: I will get out next to the Headless Horseman but have Ox carry, carry, um... Anastasia all the way to the end of the car."
"Brennan: Hell yes, great, go ahead and move your pieces so Iga and Anastasia it's 210. Ox still, at the end of the Headless Horseman's cart, Ox still has 150 movement left."
[Ally laughs]
Zac: A hundred--
Emily: Finish it out.  
"Zac: I mean, he shouldn't just go in there because he'll just get rocked, right?"
Emily: That’s true.
"Brennan: Yes, and Iga is with him as well."
"Zac: Huh, okay, y’know what?"
"Murph: You could see what’s happening though, right?"
Ally: So three more cars to get through.
"Zac: Uh, you know what, maybe, maybe we'll just keep going. I'll stay with Ox and go as far as possible."
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: Yeah, let’s keep going."
"Brennan: You have 150, you see a car, and we'll actually move down to the first car of the third line. So you move in there and see a number of passengers with truly outlandishly enormous backpacks, just leaving them on both straps, turning around fast to like, talk to each other and look at subway maps with no regard for the swinging of their enormous backpacks, and you, not putting them at their feet, in between their feet to leave the most space for other passengers and Nod bubbles up and you see the backpacks turn into monstrous abdomens of giant spiders in a place filled with spider webs. You still, again, have 100, at this point, 140 feet of movement left."
Zac: [whistles] Geez.
Emily: Are the spider webs any kind of terrain?
"Brennan: The spider webs are difficult terrain. So it costs double movement here. From where you are, 150 is still 75. You could get into the next car, you would just get attacks from these spiders."
"Zac: Shit. I mean, I haven't been hit yet."
Emily: Do it.
Zac: You know what? I'll go for it. We got to get through.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Ricky's AC right now is 20 correct?
"Zac: It's 21, actually, I changed my fighting style just because I don't have a weapon."
"Brennan: Makes sense to me, incredible. 21, oh wow! That is two hits and a crit on Ricky."
Zac: All right.
Brennan: I'm gonna need three Constitution saving throws.
Zac: Okay. Let's see how this goes. First one.
Siobhan: Can I have Misiek give him the help action?
"Brennan: Sure, that'll only give him advantage on one."
Zac: Okay.
"Siobhan: Yes, but."
"Zac: So the first one which was a 2, so great. That is, okay I got a nat 1. Can I use my Lucky feat?"
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Zac: Okay.
"Siobhan: Oh, I forgot I have Lucky."
"Zac: God, it’s uh, 14. Do I add my plus 4 to my saves?"
Brennan: Yes you do.
Zac: Or are they added. I think they might already be added right?
"Brennan: Oh, for Ricky? I think it's probably already, yes it's already added."
"Zac: Damn okay, so that was only a 14."
Brennan: 14 passes.
"Zac: Okay, cool. I need two more."
Brennan: Two more.
Zac: Another 14.
Lou: Mwah.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Or 16 actually then.
Lou: Hey hey.
Zac: Okay now that's like a 17 plus 6.
Lou: Yeah!
Brennan: Awesome. You do take 27 points of damage.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: And you take, and then you take 11 and 8. You take another 19 poison damage from the spiders as you race through here."
"Zac: If I'm immune to disease, does that affect anything?"
Brennan: Does not affect poison in this instance.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: Hell yes. But you can move another 75 feet through here. So you get into the next subway car. In the next subway car, you see that there is a sort of well-to-do Upper East Side woman who has monopolized three seats around her in every direction with her various shopping bags and personal items, taking up the seats around her. And you see she looks up and says,"
"Upper East Side Lady: Oh, I'm so [louder and witch-like] sorry to have bothered you, sonny! Hee hee hee!"
Brennan: A witch's cauldron explodes out of the dream realm. A witch with her cauldrons and herbs and various bags of newts and toads taking up all of this public seating space.
Zac: Frickin’ Halloween.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: This is, this is where Ox ends his movement. Iga and Ricky, Ricky, you used an action to cast a spell but Iga, you have your full turn as you enter this new chamber."
"Siobhan: Okay, can I use Thunder Step to bring the animals or like just bring Ricky?"
Zac: Like Ox?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: It depends on if spells that affect Ricky also— I think Thunder Step is only one other person but if the spell also affects both of them.
"Siobhan: I mean, if not."
"Brennan: While mounted on your steed you can make any spell that targets only you also target your speed, you can move all three of you with Thunder Step."
Zac: Ooh!
Siobhan: Fantastic. Ah then I will.
Emily: Does your little drake get left behind?
"Siobhan: Yeah. Misiek comes in my bag, surely."
"Brennan: Misiek comes in the bag exactly, yes yes."
Lou: Misiek comes in the bag.
"Siobhan: I grab onto Ricky a little too tight and I say,"
Iga: Let me repay the favor.
Ricky: What?
Siobhan: And I cause Thunder Step to take us 90 feet down the next car.
Lou: Wow!
"Brennan: Incredible, look at that. You guys, this was a very specific gimmick to this fight which was limited time and a long way to go. Incredible. You rush forward, you, Ox, Pete literally like reaches out, touches Ox and just like shortens Ox's relationship to space in like quantum relationship is like pure dream physics of like, yeah, you know how in a dream like you go to like you go to your dad's house and you walk out your door and then you're just like in your dad, just woo, you're suddenly, boom, somewhere else. The final car, you see the flapping door of the MTA conductor themself cackling over the intercom with the most fiendish antipopuli subway corruption of all. You see a man well over six feet tall, sitting in a five seat stretch of seats, his knees pulled apart, exposing his crotch out to the middle of the subway car, literally blocking off five seats with the fearsome spread of his mighty legs, manspreading from pole to pole, and the dream erupts and you see the wide knees of Frankenstein's monster as Dr. Frankenstein cackles from the front of the car."
Dr. Frankenstein: Coming up on the end of the line!
"Brennan: Iga, you've used Thunder Step. I believe that's a, that's a bonus action right?"
Siobhan: No it's an action.
"Brennan: Action, cool, any bonus actions from you or are you all good?"
"Siobhan: I have no bonus actions to do, I am good."
"Brennan: Incredible, that goes from Iga."
"Zac: I didn't roll concentration, I just realized, for the."
Brennan: Go ahead and give me three concentration checks.
"Zac: Okay. Um, what do I have to beat? Sorry."
Brennan: I'm gonna say for these you're just trying to beat a 10.
"Zac: Okay I beat out on the first one got a 15,"
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Another 13.
"Brennan: Amazing. Um, those spiders are going to take double moves to move 60 into the witch's car. The witch is going to cackle, speed of 40. That's so scary, she's going to move eighty. Well she definitely can. She's going to come straight for Iga."
Siobhan: Oof.
Brennan: Iga what is your armor class?
Siobhan: 13.
"Brennan: Okay, that's going to be hits all around."
Siobhan: What kind of damage? If it's bludgeoning I'm resistant?
"Brennan: This is piercing and slashing, unfortunately."
Zac: What's hitting her? Is it just the witch?
Brennan: The witch is gonna run up and shred her to pieces with her claws.
Siobhan: Oh no.
Ally: What?
"Emily: Witches have claws, people, this is normal."
Lou: Witches have claws.
"Iga: Look at you, look at me, you think we're different? Do you think you're better than me?"
"Brennan: 13, 15, 21, 21. Iga takes 55 points of damage as the witch runs up and sinks her claws into your back. Is Iga down?"
"Siobhan: No, I'm at 32."
Brennan: Ooh! Iga is tough.
Zac: This is a new turn right?
"Brennan: New turn, yeah."
"Zac: I’m going to use, well, God, witches are probably going to have wisdom right? I'm going to use Channel Divinity again to Rebuke the Violent which means that they have to pass a DC 16 saving throw or they take all that damage or half."
"Brennan: Oh my God, I'm gonna roll this I think this is going to be our digital version of Box of Doom, because that first attack was a crit and it dealt 36 points of damage in that first attack. Ricky's DC for this is I believe 15 right?"
"Zac: It's 16 now. Cause I, yeah, I added charisma."
"Brennan: 16 and it's wisdom for her. She only gets a plus two. So you said six she needs a roll of 14 or higher here comes, here comes the Box of Doom."
Emily: Is it on the Roll 20 thing?
"Brennan: On the roll 20, 14 or higher. Let's see if she gets it."
The witch gets a nat 1.
[All cheering]
"Lou: That was honestly great,"
"Brennan: Ricky, you turn around this which sinks her talons [cackling] into Iga's back, what does Ricky say to her?"
Ricky: Excuse me? We don't know you and it's inappropriate.
"Brennan: As Ricky says, “it's inappropriate,” I'm going to choose on a natural one to have this deal double damage, which is going to be 72 points of damage. She looks and says, looks to you as you say it's inappropriate and says,"
"Witch: [stuttering] I'm so sorry. I didn't I didn't mean to cause offense I just simply thought, I'll see myself out."
"Ricky: You probably should, yeah."
"Brennan: [boom!] Radiant light, the witch is destroyed in this single act of Rebuking the Violent, she is gone."
Ally: Incredible.
Ricky: You just shouldn't touch people you don't know.
"Sofia: That's what I said, except I broke a man's wrist to say that"
"Iga: Thank you. I agree, I agree."
"Brennan: Truly that simple. Amazing. Back at the top. Pete, that's you baby."
Ally: They held for me right?
"Brennan Yes, that's right. So Kingston, that's going to be you now."
"Lou: I look over at Pete,"
"Kingston: Hey Pete, you got any more magic that's gonna get us up to the front anytime soon?"
"Pete: I don't, I went through all of my stuff."
"Kingston: Alright uh, well, I guess we're stuck."
Cody: We'll just freak out and just kill ghosts.
"Kingston: I mean, I don't think you should be messing around with ghosts anymore, Cody but yeah, it feels like."
Brennan: Kingston you do see that Cody is the caboose and is stuck in the room where the two ghosts just came back.
"Cody: This is, this is my fight, Kingston."
"Peter Cody I think we got to run, right?"
"Kingston: Yeah, we should be moving forward, Cody, all right."
Pete: Cody do you have anything that's gonna get us really far?
Cody: Yes.
Pete: Oh shit.
Kingston: Wait really?
Cody: I'm gonna omnislash these ghosts. I’m gonna use omnislash. I’m gonna use my final limit break.
Pete: I’m so stu— Why do I listen?
Cody: I'm gonna go all out.
"Lou: Cody, what are you at?"
"Murph: What am I, Cody's fine, Cody's at like 71."
"Lou: Okay, in that case, Kingston is just gonna be like"
"Kingston: Well, I mean, let's see if we can just make sure we don't get into too much trouble."
"Lou: I'm gonna step up to like here and I'm gonna cast Lightning Bolt at a fifth level into the next car. Hitting the vampire and the two break up people and start, stopping just short of Sofia."
Brennan: Oh my god what is the range on Lightning Bolt?
Lou: 100 feet.
"Brennan: Oh my god. Um, uh. Incredible."
Emily: That's gonna be so cool to see the very end of a Lightning Bolt right in front of my face.
"Brennan: Kingston, go ahead and roll damage for a fifth level Lightning Bolt."
"Lou: Okay, that's 10d6. Yeah, I take my pirate-like handkerchief off that I've been wearing and like, flip up my eye patch. Okay, here we go. This is five. Okay."
[tense music]
Lou: Only 35.
"Brennan: Pfft. You hit every single one of them for 35 points of damage. Kingston, you just sort of stride, now at this point because you're taking an action every turn you're not even running. You're just like, sort of, you know, like walking safely up. You hold your hand out the city heeds your command and you hear from the utilities of the city itself, “you got it Kingston”, and watch the third rail of the subway outside just spill Lightning through the cracks of the doors into your hand until you are once again holding a lightning bolt like Zeus. It is a, you're holding like a 40 foot long lightning bolt in your hand and as you hurl it forward, [crashing thunder] each of those vampires takes the 35 full points of lightning damage, shrieks and drops to their knees, and fully begin to turn into ash in front of you. Completely unmade by that lightning bolt."
Emily: As the smoke dissipates from their bodies it reveals Sofia at the very end with a thumbs up.
Kingston: It's good right! It's not bad! Still got it!
Sofia: Really good stuff Kingston. Your aim is incredible.
"Kingston: Hey, get to the front! I don't think we're gonna make it. Cody's gonna omnislash the ghost, I don't know what that is."
Sofia: I like Cody. He's growing on me I think.
"Kingston: Honestly, he's getting better with age if you ask me."
"Sofia: Yeah, right?"
"Brennan: Incredible speaking of which, Cody it is your turn after Kingston fries these vampires."
Murph: Cody gives a knowing nod to Kingston like this is all part of the plan and then he drags his giant sword Gears of War style so that sparks come up as he runs across and he runs backwards to the ghosts.
Lou: Oh Cody.
Emily: I'm just so worried now that he's 47 all of his cultural references are gonna be so different than people who are now his peers.
"Murph: Truly they are all, out of game, they are all references that I remember from high school and they already don’t hold up."
Zac: It's so sad that he's a 47 year old man running like an anime character. 47 year old white man.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Murph: Okay, so he'll take his so there's one ghost that has been Suggested right? Or is that..."
Brennan: Yeah correct.
"Murph: Okay, so I'm gonna go after the one that has not gotten to do anything."
"Brennan: The Suggested one actually left, fully left the subway car so."
"Murph: Okay, so there is just one."
"Brennan: So yeah, this ghost right here the lowermost ghost is gone. And then this other one in front of you is back from Banishment."
"Murph: Great I will just go after this one. First things first, thunderous smite as a bonus action to charge up my sword."
Cody: [gruffly] Omnislash!
Murph: And I go all out. That's a 17.
Brennan: Hits. 17 hits.
Zac: This is like a kid playing in his room.
"Murph: Okay, so I've got Thunderous Smite—"
"Emily: Again, a 47 year old man."
"Murph: And then I'm also going to Divine Smite at a third level. So that's going to be 5d8, cause third level would be four and it's a undead."
"Brennan: Hell yes because you guys are segmented now, I'm gonna let you resolve the amount of damage you do to that ghost and also move on to Sofia's turn, so you roll that damage. Sofia."
Emily: So here's what I want to do I need to I want to avoid going in this room with difficult terrain.
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: So what I want to do is I want to do a pull up,"
Lou mimics doing pull-ups.
"Emily: And then do Step of the Wind as a dash action and run on the top of these, on the top of the subway cars."
"Lou: [snapping repeatedly] Yes, yes yes yes yes."
The cast cheer.
Brennan: Yes yes.
Emily: For 180 feet which should get me to the end.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
Brennan: Oh my fucking God.
Siobhan: So sick.
"Brennan: A million percent. Sofia, go ahead and move yourself as far as you. Yeah the Headless Horseman is gonna take a swing at you, does not hit as one of the hooves lash out and you pull yourself up onto the roof and... 90 mile an hour car. You, running atop a moving subway, sprint 180 feet."
"Emily: Yeah, so with 180 feet—"
Ally: Hell yeah.
Emily: I should plop myself right down in the mix here.
"Murph: And I did 48, 48 damage."
Ally: [wheezing with laughter] So funny!
"Brennan: 48\. You annihilate this ghost, dude."
Murph: Great.
Ally: But no one's there to see it!
[Emily laughs]
"Lou: Oh wait, we watch. We watch. Come on, Pete. We watch."
Cody: Did anyone see that?
Kingston: I want to see what an Omnislash is.
"Cody: Did you guys? [looking around] Kingston, Pete! Fuck."
"Ricky: [to himself] God, I hope he’s not dead, that old child."
Murph: I use my second attack to punch a window.
"Brennan: I will say there is still a, there's one ghost left in the, in the car that came back from Pete's other Banishment. So you have two, two attacks so you nail—"
"Murph: Oh, sweet."
"Brennan: So there's one other ghost left, you could take your other attack if you want."
"Murph: Yeah, definitely. Um, I can't keep track of how far I went. Can I get back to that guy?"
"Brennan: Yes, because remember, the cells are only three point five."
"Murph: Oh, sweet."
"Brennan: You're only 15 feet away from that ghost, so yeah."
"Murph: So I'm just going to run back and freak out again. I'm going to go, I'm using literally all my spell slots."
Brennan: Incredible. I love it.
"Murph: I'm going to cast, oh wait no, I already used a bonus action so I just have to do a regular attack."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Do I want to Great Weapon Fighting? No, that's."
Zac: Because regular damage doesn't hurt ghosts right?
"Murph: I think it does like half or something, I don't know."
"Zac: Oh okay, yeah."
"Murph: Boy. Should I Great Weapon Fighting? Yeah, maybe not. Okay, just regular attack. Good thing I didn't. Only 14."
Brennan: 14 hits.
"Murph: Nice. Okay, then I will do another third level smite, use my last spell slots."
"Brennan: Hell yes. As you're rolling that, Sofia rushes forward. The werewolf is now sitting politely because it was chastised by Ricky, Sofia before you leap down. You see ahead of you. For everyone that's in that subway car you hear the mad scientist at the front whisper to Frankenstein's monster and say,"
"Dr. Frankenstein: I've got these ones. The roof, monster!"
"Brennan: In the middle of that table, Sofia you see an eruption on the roof blasting through the metal Frankenstein's monster punches through the roof to meet you on the roof of the moving subway and is going to charge you."
Emily: I get low.
Lou: Hell yes.
"Brennan: Oh, this battle was as cool as I wanted it to be."
Murph: 38 damage by the way. 38 damage.
"Brennan: You obliterate, I'm sorry, no, 38. This was, this one was uninjured. There's still a ghost in front of Cody all the way back in the second car. It's so close to death."
Murph: Fuck.
Brennan: It's so close to death.
Zac: Oh Cody.
"Brennan: Yes, and actually right after Cody's turn this ghost is going to go. I hate to do it to you, Cody."
Murph: Fuck.
Brennan: I'm going to need a Wisdom saving throw.
"Lou: Fuck off, dude, are you gonna make Cody a 60 year old man?"
Siobhan: 70 year old man.
"Emily: Wait, isn't there still Silence there though there's still silence so if it's about, does that, I haven't taken any more damage to do a concentration roll and I think it just stays in that location."
"Brennan: “Centered on a point you choose within range.” Yes, that is true. There's still Silence there. Cody, would you, what would you have rolled, Cody?"
"Murph: Oh, I would have passed, I think. Yeah, 21. 21."
"Brennan: Okay the ghost tries to scream and cannot. It is surrounded by Silence. Werewolf, we go all the way down to Frankenstein's monster. It's gonna make two slam attacks on Sofia, who's back at 21, right? Sofia that lumbering Frankenstein's monster with bolts in the neck greenskin this giant long leg still, still bow-legged and manspreading even up here on the roof, takes two wild swings that you effortlessly dodge and block."
"Emily: I'm actually not, I'm not at 21, I’m at 19, because Ricky did something else so Shield of Faith is gone."
"Brennan: Copy that. Okay, even with that roll, the natural 5 and 2 missing Sofia by a mile. You are exchanging punches with Frankenstein's monster on the, on the roof of a barreling A train headed uptown."
Emily pretends to dodge blows.
Brennan: Kingston.
Lou: What?
"Brennan: [mimicking Lou] Huh? With all the vampires gone, you get charged by the Headless Horseman who summons another pumpkin head. I'm gonna need Dexterity saving throws from Pete and Kingston."
Ally: Ooh.
"Lou: Okay, happy to do it."
"Ally: Aye, 21."
Lou: That's a mod 20.
Brennan: Each of you only takes half damage from this.
Lou: Hell yeah.
Brennan: Hold on one second.
"Zac: To be clear if the werewolf sees people fighting in front of it, it will come out of indifference."
"Brennan: Gotcha. Copy that. Oh, this guy rolled so bad. 4, 6, 5 is 11, 67. You each take 17 halved to 8 points of fire damage from this exploding pumpkin head and then Kingston is going to take two hoof attacks, one of which hits Kingston for another 5 points of damage. Come on, Headless Horseman. The Headless Horseman you see it charging across over the, the ashy corpses that are splitting in the wind of the vampires you sundered with your Lightning Bolt, rides you down. How's Kingston looking after this fearsome charge from the Headless Horseman?"
Lou: 61\. Kingston’s...
Ally: Yeah.
"Lou: Kingston's got, there's like a, there's a new kid on the block and he’s just got to prove himself, you know, he's not out here. He wants Cody to think he's cool, you know. I'm the Vox Populi, damn it."
"Cody: We are, we are contemporaries. We are pretty much the same age."
Kingston: Now.
"Brennan: Amazing, that is going to be Ricky, that is your turn."
"Zac: Okay, so we are in that cart."
"Brennan: Yes, you're in the front cart and the witch has been destroyed. You can hear spiders chasing you from back behind you but all that's left in this car is the mad scientist at the front of the car."
"Zac: Okay, it may not work out but I'm going to send Ox back as far as he can to try to grab somebody and bring them closer."
"Brennan: Ox can go do whatever you want Ox to do, but those spiders are filling up that car and so Ox will get some attacks of opportunity from them."
"Zac: Yeah, he's pretty weak I guess, can I bring [laughs] Anastasia and myself closer to the mad scientist?"
Brennan: You absolutely can.
Zac: With Ox.
Siobhan: I actually am fine where I am.
Zac: Okay cool. Then I will use Ox's movement to get to the mad scientist.
"Brennan: Hell yeah cool. You charge the mad scientist, what does Ricky do with his action as he, as he, also with the haste Ox can make attacks here as well if you want?"
"Zac: Oh, right. Okay I will say I guess Ricky just wants to just, first just chat with the mad scientist for a second."
"Ricky: Hey, man, what's going on? What is this about?"
"Dr. Frankenstein: [laughs] No room no room the end of the line is coming. There's nothing left, tides coming in deep deep down and it's time for everything that was… [stares intensely]"
"Brennan: And you see his eyes flicker and says,"
Dr. Frankenstein: [quietly] To go away. [manic again] Death to you all!
Brennan: And it looks like he's about to do some messed up magic stuff.
"Zac: Okay, I'm you know, it's not Ricky's favorite. Ricky is just gonna take a regular... You know what actually, um, Ricky is going to let Ox attack because he has Pack Tactics."
Brennan: That's correct so he has advantage.
"Zac: And so, and he has two attacks right now because he has Haste."
"Brennan: Oh, he does, that's right. Yes yes yes."
"Zac: Okay, so um. 19 though."
"Brennan: Ah, dude, 19 hits. Also I'll point something out. This mad scientist has bottles and beakers all over this room. You think that if you can prevent this dude from in other words using somatic components. I'll be clear, this is a spellcaster enemy. If you can grapple and pin this dude because Ox just got that 19, you may be able to prevent this dude from casting spells on his next turn."
"Zac: Gotcha, if I can grapple him, okay."
Brennan: Basically yeah.
"Zac: Um so on it okay, that's only on a charge that it can do it DC 14 saving throw or you'd be knocked prone."
"Brennan: I'll let you do, Ox just charged because he charged with you."
Zac: Oh yeah he did okay let's do that.
[Box of Doom music]
"Brennan: This is important. This guy has nothing to Strength, needs to roll a 14 or higher. This is huge, you have reached the conductor of the train, the Dr. Frankenstein."
"Ricky: Ox, can you push him down on the ground please?"
Brennan: 10\. Ox successfully pushes the mad scientist to the ground.
Zac: He leaps over my shoulder.
"Brennan: Boom! Knocks him to the ground. You will, let me see if Ox has anything left, any other attacks. So Ox has used his charge and then the hits with his attack. So he has his attack he can either do damage or try to make an Athletics to grapple himself, if you want to roll Athletics."
"Emily: Picturing just dalmatian arms, putting someone in a headlock."
"Brennan: Yeah, if you want to roll Athletics for Ox to try."
Zac Hell yeah.
Brennan You would have to finish the pin because Ox doesn't have enough attacks to do it in one round but he can start it for you basically.
"Zac: Okay yeah, sure. I'll do that. So it's like he has plus four to strength so that's the..."
Brennan Yeah that's what you're adding.
Zac: Nat 1.
"Brennan: Oof, brutal. Okay, let's see if this dude rolls a nat 1. No, 16, he makes it. Now Ricky has advantage on anything you wanna do this round."
"Zac: Gotcha. Okay I'm going to, can I make a check to see if I can see what's going on with the control panels to slow things down."
"Brennan: Give me a raw Intelligence check, I'm going to say that this is a DC 20 Intelligence check."
"Zac: Interesting, interesting. Nat 20, nat 20."
[All cheering]
Siobhan: Ricky!
Ally: No fucking way.
"Zac attempts to turn his camera down to show his die, but is foiled by the green screen."
Brennan You've got to be fucking kidding me.
Siobhan: Smart king.
Ally: You got to turn off your background thing.
Emily: Turn off your background so you can see it.
Brennan: I literally want to turn off your fucking like virtual background.
"Zac’s background switches off. His die is shiny blue and is, indeed, a nat 20."
Emily and Siobhan: Yes!
"Brennan: Oh my fucking God, oh my fucking God. Ricky, you look at the conductor’s panel. By the way, what could Ricky have made that roll on?"
Zac: A nat 20.
[Brennan wheezes in laughter]
Zac: I have 10 intelligence.
"Brennan: Ricky you look at the most complicated series of dials, knobs, beakers, lightning all, everything like that. This is the exact kind of thing that would normally give Ricky a full. Not like, Ricky would not panic over this but you would just be completely over your head not knowing what it was. But here's the deal man, there's nothing you care more about than safety. And you took an elective course as a young firefighter just in case you were ever on a runaway subway. As Ox pins this mad scientist to the ground. Ricky, you know the sequence code and there's a key in the ignition to open a secret panel which pulls the lever that instantly master overrides every emergency brake in every single car on the train."
"Zac: Okay I'm gonna step over the mad scientist and just be like,"
"Ricky: Sorry, buddy, but time to slow down."
[all laughing]
Siobhan: What a hero.
Zac: And do that.
"[adventurous, heroic orchestral music]"
"Brennan: Absolutely astounding. As the train slows Cody facing that last ghost you watch the ghost fade back into just a regular person and suddenly everyone kinda looks up and notices you just holding a sword on the subway. Kingston and Pete, you are looking at a dude, he's kinda sweating and breathing. Who is looking at you like, he's like holding a bike and he's like in a different car than he was looking kinda confused and upset. Sofia, as you're trading blows with Frankenstein's monster, suddenly you're on the roof of a slowing subway with a regular guy who screams and falls to the ground fully crying. Like, [yells]. Looking around."
Sofia: It's okay I'll hold your hand through this.
Brennan: Iga you look see the cars spread out behind you the woman right behind you that was moments ago a witch and Ricky in the front compartment saves the train.
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: Everyone now back in the waking world all of that strange dream stuff fades away as the train pulls into the second to last station. You have saved the day, defeated the runaway Halloween car and a group of passengers looking around. Ricky, you see that the little PA comes on as the sort of normal looking conductor looks up from the ground as Ox licks his face. [lick] The PA system is open in front of you and you see that a bunch of confused people start like yelling and shouting around here."
Zac: I take the intercom and talk to the train.
"Ricky: [through a tinny PA] Be calm, everyone. Turns out someone threw up and that's what happened."
"Sofia: It was me, I threw up, it was me."
"Ricky: She threw up and that's the explanation I got. Go about your day. Hope everyone has a safe Halloween, don't eat any candy that has little openings on it. Stay safe out there."
"Brennan: The entire train looks around and someone in a little Dracula came in, someone else is dressed like a bumblebee and someone who's some political reference and someone else who's some other thing all [clapping]. Train erupts into applause. The doors open, all of you from various places of the train walk up onto the platform and all observe each other as something magical seeps back into the ground."
[brief ethereal ambiance]
Ally: Can we do like an Insight check to try to catch some info about that?
Brennan: Yeah give me an Arcana or an Insight check.
"Ally: Ooh, yeah. 28."
Brennan: 28\. Pete.
Emily: I got much less than that.
"Brennan: You see Umbral Arcana which you have only ever known as something manufactured by the Gramercy Occult Society. But you see it in your sort of dream vision, in a like a raw unprocessed form and it looks like it is ebbing away, and when I say ebbing away I'm choosing my words carefully here. You guys successfully defeated this rotten like anti-New York sentiment Halloween cursed subway. And as you congregate again, Pete you're looking down like in between the train and the track underneath it. And when I say it's ebbing away it's almost like you're seeing a tide going out. As though it's going out now but tides don't just go out forever."
"Emily: Yeah, we beat back the tide but the ocean is still there."
"Zac: Fighting an ocean, how?"
"Brennan: So Pete you're looking at that, it does look. There's something here within this that seemed like an element of Nod escaping but every time you've seen Nod enter the waking world it was a violent act or an act of desire to be in the waking world. Like the whole thing Nod talked about before that, dreams wanna be real. This is the first time you've seen dreams enter the waking world and the vibe you get is wrong man. It doesn't feel like these dreams came here because they wanted to be here. It feels like they were being pushed here, like tide, in an effort to get away from something else on the other side."
Ally: [frowns] Whoa.
"Brennan: You're back in the waking world as Nod dissipates and Pete you're gazing. Um Sofia, go ahead and give me a Perception check with advantage if you'd be so kind."
"Emily: Okay. That's only going to be a 15. Oh, 15 though."
"Brennan: You look down at Pete, Pete's giving you a hand by pointing it out. You can see this shit. The Umbral Arcana is definitionally like obfuscating. It's a fucking force that makes you not see stuff. You and Pete watch as this kind of haze, it's a haze that moves away. It chills things, it dampens things. It almost like, it's sort of grimy subway station floor but you almost can swear like it saps the color from the floor in a way, moves out. You are able to both perceive it and Sofia, your hackles raise. ‘Cause Pete, you're seeing your responsibility which is the dream realm behaving in a really unusual way and Sofia, you're seeing some shit that confirms a lot of what you've been studying in the history of the Order’s battle against forces from the dreaming."
"Sofia: Hey, hey Pete, I know we haven't really formally worked together very much but I think I have more information about the dream world that, I, you know I would love to maybe go over with you sometime."
"Pete: Cool, yeah we could go get a coffee or like a panini or something."
Sofia: I'd love a panini.
"Pete: Yeah, totally."
Sofia: Yeah.
Pete: Yeah it'd be cool to talk.
Ally: And then I look down at like my 60 day chip.
[Brennan and Emily laughing]
Pete: Just seems like it would be cool to talk.
"Sofia: Yeah, right."
"Brennan: Hell yes, you guys have that connection there. Ricky you're sort of going, I feel like asking passengers what happened and immediately assuming you are an authority figure here and coming up to ask you."
"Zac: Presenting like, sometimes the subway will jostle you around and if you've just recently ate something that's not agreeing with you and you're not feeling well it can make you throw up."
"Brennan: The dude who was in his dream self, the Frankenstein's monster gets down off the roof of the subway car looking like what the fuck happened like."
"Sofia: It was you, you threw up."
"Dude: Oh shit, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry?"
"Ricky: It happens, it happens."
"Brennan: Cody, you're 47."
[cast loses it]
Ally completely disappears offscreen for a moment from laughing.
Zac: Can I try to Remove Curse? From Cody?
"Lou: Yeah also I have Dispel Magic, is there something we can do?"
"Brennan: Uh, I’m gonna say, Ricky and Kingston give me medicine checks."
Zac: Okay.
Lou: Okay.
Emily: [through laughter] This is so funny.
Lou: I got 27.
"Brennan: Hell yeah,"
"Cody: So just to be clear I might walk in the darkness but I do have a zest for life and I would like to not have 20 years off my life, that would be awesome. I wanna hang out in the mall again. I wanna do cool shit. I'm here to do rad shit, I'm not here to, you know. I don't wanna go to the other side yet, so fix me, please."
"Brennan: You see Bazathrax goes,"
"Bazathrax: It feels bad in here, it feels really not as good. It didn't feel great to start. I'll be honest."
"Cody: Just trade up man, trade me up! Fuck!"
Zac: I got a 21 on my Medicine check.
"Brennan: Incredible, both of you. Kingston and Ricky you guys look at each other, I'm gonna say this both of you guys know what would be needed to handle this which is a Greater Restoration spell, is a very powerful kind of restoration. Kingston, on a 27 you know that not even Greater Restoration will cut it unless it's in the next 24 hours."
"Kingston: Oh Cody, we need to hustle all right. We need to hustle."
"Cody: Cool, yeah."
"Kingston: But we can get this done. It's just gonna require a little bit of hustle. A little bit, not too much, don't worry we can get it done."
"Cody I can see if the devil will give you my soul, do you need my soul?"
Kingston Honestly we're done talking to the devil. You especially.
"Iga: I also have a way that we could maybe remove the curse, but it is a big risk and we'll keep it as a second option."
Kingston: Great.
Sofia: Interesting.
"Brennan: Kingston on that Insight, as you're kinda looking over Cody and both checking him out again, Cody is in a bad way. You look, the woman who was the witch, and a couple other people, walks out. The woman who's the witch is again a very, like, wealthy sort of Upper East Side lady, she walks with a bunch of shopping bags like she's going to visit a family friend or something like that but on a 20 insight you see that something is sort of wrong with her. The only way I can put it is you see some sort of like deep down emptiness in her eyes. She's here. She's like about to go walk and do her thing, she doesn't look too unnerved but you just see some sort of emptiness in her eyes. And on a 28 insight, what does Kingston do at this moment?"
Lou: Can I approach her?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can approach her."
"Kingston: Hey excuse me miss, you were on the train, right?"
"Upper East Side Lady: Um yes, I was, sorry, yeah I was on the train."
Kingston: We're part of a task force that's trying to help. Are you feeling okay today?
"UES Lady: I'm feeling um, feeling all right. I, umm… [sighs]"
"Brennan: She looks down the bag she's carrying and she has like a bunch of stuff here that she's been shopping for. She looks up and says,"
"UES Lady: I'm all right, yeah."
Kingston: Just all right?
"Brennan: She looks up and says,"
"UES Lady: The store where my husband bought our 30th anniversary, 30th wedding anniversary gift closed down and I don't, to be honest with you sir I don't, I'm having a reaction to it that's very, I feel very sad and it feels, I feel very childish for it. It was just a store, I hadn't been there in..."
Cody: I am actually 47 years old and I have attachments to some stores because people attach memories to places so it's actually fucking fine what you’re doing. It's fucking normal.
Kingston: This is Cody. He's also part of the task force.
"Ricky: Hey Cody, Cody, actually Cody."
"Pete: Oh Cody, hey."
Emily: I Minor Illusion a cool sword 60 feet away from this conversation.
(all laughing)
Cody: I need to go but I just want you to know that I see you and that’s fucking bullshit.
Murph: And I walk towards the sword.
Zac: “And I walk towards the sword.”
"Brennan: “And I walk towards the sword!” You see, Kingston, she looks over and smiles and says,"
UES Lady: What a disturbed young man.
"Kingston: He's all right, he's been through a lot today."
"Brennan: She turns to look and says,"
"UES Lady: It’s just I don't, a favorite music venue near me shut down as well and my youngest son just got a job that's gonna take him out of the city and he was my last child that still lived here."
"Brennan: Kingston you get a very powerful impulse of something deep at work. It's not in this woman, this woman is not like the keystone of it but you just sense something out there in a very chilling way. She looks at you and says,"
"UES Lady: I don't know. You're an older man. The city changes all the time, it has no respect for its history it's just, I don't know it's just getting to me today. You sit there asking yourself, you know, what, if anything, stays."
"Kingston: You know it's funny. That, I don't know where I heard but that feels familiar, I think. Thank you for talking to me. I hope that you find solace in the change that is coming and stay safe."
"Brennan: You see her walk away and the emptiness in her eyes reflects back to you the emptiness of that store front you saw this morning. ‘Cause the last thing she does is she says,"
"UES Lady: In any case all this was brought on because we had a very aggressive realtor who was trying to buy our apartment. We've lived in the Upper East side for a long long time and this extremely invasive realtors were sort of harassing us and asking us to sell but now that my youngest son is not here maybe I should. I have friends that live out in the Hamptons, I have friends that live out in Long Island and Massachusetts and I don't know."
"Kingston: Hey, I mean—"
Iga: You can't let those blood suckers take your house.
"Kingston: This is Anastasia, she's also a part of the taskforce."
Iga: Hey I think actually you've come to me for a reading before I think I recognize your face.
UES Lady: [gasps] Madam Anastasia!
"Brennan: She lights up, she says"
"UES Lady: Oh my goodness, Madam Anastasia, you're part of a task force?"
"Brennan: And you see for a moment she buries that emptiness but then again on a 28, Kingston, it's not gone. The last I'll say as this woman starts to talk to you, Anastasia amazed to find you here, is you look at the box in your purse and you see the last little bit of some of that haze, that ephemeral smoke sludge seep into the crack of your box and disappear inside it. And that's all for this episode of the Unsleeping City. Tune in next week."

[upbeat music]
"Brennan: [drum roll] Hello, one and all. And welcome back to another exciting episode of ""The Unsleeping City."" I am your humble Dungeon Master Brennan Lee Mulligan, with me as always are our intrepid heroes, say hi, intrepid heroes!"
Everyone is revealed to be making exaggerated walking motions.
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
[laughing]
"Brennan: Heck yeah. Last we left them off, the champions of the Unsleeping City, heroes of New York were…"
Everyone but Murph is still pretending to walk.
"Brennan: Had just fought a haunted Halloween subway car, filled to the brim with monsters, made from a horrifying intermingling of an otherworldly substance known as antipopuli which is basically antimatter, but made of the norms and customs of a given place, mixed with this strange ebbing of raw Umbral Arcana. This intermingling of sort of pure dream substance, being extruded out into the waking world, took over this subway car and our heroes found themselves foisted not into Nod, but into this bubble of dreaming that was physically present in the waking world. Fought their way out of the subway car, past various Halloween monsters that had taken over people breaching subway etiquette in very egregious ways, zapped some vampires, admonished a werewolf to sit down and calm down."
Zac wags his finger scoldingly.
"Brennan: (laughing) We fought Frankenstein's monster on the roof of a 90 mile per hour express train and due to some careful reading of the city's safety ordinances, shut the train down and stopped the passengers and got them off safely. Again, civic safety coming to save the day from the forces of nightmare and the dreaming."
Zac: As always.
Brennan: As always.
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: With a carefully hasted Dalmatian, some wicked spell casting and turning of the undead and our dear friend, Cody, aging 20 years, that is now a 47 year old man."
(Siobhan and Emily crack up)
"Brennan: Our heroes saved Halloween in New York as the costumed passengers left. We cut now to a secret chamber within St. Owen's Hospital. You guys took that A train way uptown. So, St. Owen's was the nearest spot. You guys ended up in the Bronx and it is now probably about nine and 9:30 pm, Halloween, plenty of Halloween night left to go."
"Emily: Oh, okay."
"Brennan: But you are at St. Owen's Hospital. Ricky, you've got some salves and wraps on bad spider bites. Sofia, you've got a little drip, but are otherwise just seated in a chair. The person who is up in traction on a hospital bed right now is Cody who, as Kingston has said, you guys basically need, like an eight-hour period to long rest. Does Kingston--? Correct me if I'm wrong. You have the ability to cast Greater Restoration, but you need to prepare it. So you need eight hours to work on Cody basically."
"Lou: I do, I was also gonna ask and I don't know where it is in the world. La Gran Gata gave me that Tide."
[Emily gasps]
Lou: Or like some kind of Detergent of Greater Restoration that I don't think I ever used in season one.
Emily: Ohhhhh.
Murph: Whoa!
Siobhan: Ohhhh.
Lou: Would that be here or at my apartment?
"Brennan: Sorry, this absolutely should be here in your items. This is the Holy Grail Detergent that you got from La Gran Gata, which will speed this up a whole lot. I'm gonna say that this is probably in your magical nurse’s office."
Lou: Great.
"Cody: Kingston, this duster is dry clean only so..."
"Kingston: Hey, my man, this is magical detergent. All right, I don't think it's gonna do anything to the duster, all right?"
Cody: All right.
Kingston: It's gonna be okay.
"Cody: Cool, cool--"
Kingston: The duster off.
Ricky: We could maybe take the duster off and put it on a hanger.
Iga: Maybe we should hand wash it.
"Sofia: Yeah, I--"
Cody: I prefer if I kept it on at all times.
(group laughs)
"Sofia: That’s a good point, I don’t want to see it off."
"Cody: Although I do have this cool tattoo now, nevermind."
"Pete: Yeah, dude, show off the tattoo, get that duster outta here."
Cody: That's true.
Murph: Take the duster off.
Emily: I throw it out the window.
(group laughs)
Cody: No!
Zac: He dies now. [pantomimes climbing out a window] Grabs it.
(laughs)
"Lou: Yeah, how does the Holy Grail detergent work, am I washing Cody or am I washing—"
Ally: The duster?
Emily: Are you eating a Tide Pod?
"Brennan: I think at this point, Kingston. I think at this point--"
"Lou: “Eat this tide pod, Cody. Open—”"
(group laughs)
Murph: In his mouth already. “Do you dare me?”
"Brennan: I’ll leave it up to you. The Holy Grail Detergent, you used to one of its four doses splashing on Kugrash way back at the battle of the stock exchange."
"Emily: That's the last person, they had used it on? [rolls a die]"
Brennan: That's the last person that it was ever used on. [gives a thumbs up] Sofia is okay?
Emily: Yeah. Kugrash is a trigger for Sofia.
[group groans]
"Brennan: Kingston I think also though, it's up to you. If you would want to, you could also leave it here in the hospital, and like distill it into medicine so you don't have to use full doses of it. Like when you have to just splash it on someone, that's a very inefficient way of using what is a very incredible resource."
"Lou: Great, in that case, yeah, maybe I'll just leave the detergent on the wall in and we'll just do it the long way, because we have the time and the space to do so."
"Brennan: And I think too, because you have that here, I will let you, it's not gonna take a full eight hours. It's like, you're like, I think maybe Cody, you see with all these medical supplies, you see Kingston put on the gloves, get all washed up and dip a syringe into a big plastic jug of detergent."
[Emily wheezes]
[whimsical music]
Cody: [quietly] What?
"Kingston: Oh. It's a lot— [flicks the syringe] Yeah. That'd be right, that would be just right."
Ricky: You don’t know how much that looks like poison.
Kingston: Don't worry.
"Sofia: Yeah it really does. Or maybe like a fun, like a children's candy. That shouldn't be a children's candy."
[Siobhan laughs]
Ricky: Yeah. Too colorful.
"Sofia: Just like, a brightly, bright blue syringe."
"Cody: It's because I'm like kind of a devil now. So I need to be like hurt to be healed. It's like when you cast like fire spells on a fire monster in Final Fantasy or something, ‘cause I am the darkness. [takes a drag on his tiny cigarette]"
[music abruptly cuts out]
"Pete: You can't smoke in here, man."
(group laughs)
Kingston: You can't smoke in here.
"Cody: Honestly, that's my fucking bad."
Kingston: Thank you Pete. I appreciate that.
Pete: You can't.
Kingston: I really appreciate.
"Emily: I take the cigarette, throw it out the window. Hopefully the duster catches on fire."
"Cody: Yeah, I think you guys are fucking cool. You guys did cool shit on the train. I'm not trying to fucking freak out. Okay, I'm cool, shoot me with your poison."
"Kingston: [laughs] Okay, it's not poison, but okay."
"Lou: Yeah, and I just, I give Cody a nice good old dose."
Brennan: [laughing] You give a—
"Sofia: Yeah, could you do a little something for his personality too?"
"Kingston: Sofia, we both know there's nothing we can do about that."
[group laughs hysterically]
"Brennan: Incredible. So you have, it's very calm in here. You guys hear laughter and partying outside, but in here it's very calm. Cody, it's gonna take Cody still like about an hour, hour and a half for this to like take effect, you hear, beep beep, sort of measuring his vitals. As you can see, slowly de-aging from this ghost nightmare."
Murph: And the whole time I'm just talking to Kingston about nu metal bands.
[Brennan and Emily wheeze in laughter]
Kingston: Uh-huh. So it’s—
"Cody: So you see, yeah, so there's Three Days Grace, which like, they're pretty cool, I guess."
Kingston: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
"Cody: But then there's Breaking Benjamin, which is awesome."
Kingston: Yeah. Yep.
"Cody: And then there's Linkin Park and some people are Chester guys. Some people are Mike Shinoda guys, personally a Shinoda guy."
Kingston is nodding the whole time.
[group laughs]
"Cody: Then when we're talking about pro wrestling, we've got the Hardy Boyz. It's like, do you like the tactical prowess of Matt Hardy—"
"Kingston: Wait though, from the, hold on, the Hardy Boys? From the book."
Cody: Yeah.
"Kingston: They wrestle now, is that, who, what?"
(laughs)
"Cody: Is anybody hearing this, is anybody hearing this? Fuck, dude."
"Iga: Yes, my son Nicholas also like the Hardy Boy books."
"Cody: No, not those, no, they're not from—"
"Kingston: [crosstalk] It’s those, it’s those, it’s those two children, they love running around and—"
Iga: [crosstalk] I read those to him when he was very very young and he liked it.
"Cody: They're not the child sleuths. Okay, they're fucking cool ass wrestlers who wear cool shit, do flips off ladders and stuff."
Iga: Then why do they have the same name as the childhood sleuths?
"Cody: No, they're Boyz with a Z."
Kingston: Oh! ...Okay.
"Zac: I'm gonna take off and find my sister, I think."
[group laughs]
"Brennan: Hell yeah. For you guys here as Cody is healing, you guys, it's been, I won't say it's been a wild two days for everybody because I think for a lot of folks, for Kingston and Pete and Sofia and Ricky, yesterday the day before Halloween was kind of like you guys in your routines and your new life. And today, I mean like even for this, Halloween always has some fucked up shit happen on it. Like even the past couple of years, you guys there's always something that requires... Even Kingston for you that have kind of like very much in your comfortable domestic life now, Halloween always calls some attention somewhere. It's just a crazy day in New York. You're in this room, Cody, weirdly Cody's ghost thing is the most fixable easy thing. The reason you're in this room, that's ta— able to taken care of, peeking out from under Cody's shirt is this chest piece with this new bullshit devil lord that Pete was able to bind to Cody, which has created an incredible feedback loop for Cody and with some quick sorcererous thinking on Pete's part because yes, this is your boss, but also he's now bound to your body and can't leave. [laughs] So it's—"
"Iga: You are always on the clock when you sell yourself to a devil, that's what they say."
[group laughs]
Cody: Amen.
"Brennan: Additionally, so the main thing is looking at you are for, especially for Iga and Cody, this has not been a normal last 24 hours. The appearance of this devil and binding it to you, what the devils are sort of saying about, how empty and wide open New York is, and then Iga for you, your box changing for the first time in forever and looking at the chest and it's even… so the chest is still small in your handbag with Misiek curled around it, but you feel it kind of pulsating there. And then I think for Sofia and Pete, there is that weird thing of what you saw with the Umbral Arcana in the subway at the end of the fight. And for Kingston, I think with that Insight check, you didn't see the like, I mean like Sofia and Pete handle that dream realm shit pretty well, but you feel something in the city as well, the real city."
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah before you guys get into… and I think Iga you're also looking at your box in your handbag and maybe want to, it might be good to inspect it as its, the fullness of its, of what it can do. Would you guys have called anybody here after the subway fight?"
"Zac: Oh yeah, I was just thinking, if we actually are taking a beat to like, just to have a conversation about it, I probably would call Esther."
"Emily: Yeah, I was going to suggest the same. I also should probably I'm like, I've started… I know the Order of the Concrete Fist has a strange relationship with the dreaming world. And I'm worried that I've sort of breached their trust by telling Pete about the stuff that I read in the library. So I feel like I don't know how far I wanna walk down this path without like, getting the A-OK from one of them."
"Ally: Yeah, remind me again, what did you tell me from the library?"
"Emily: I basically vaguely told you that like there's that the world of dreaming is bigger than we've seen and there might be some beasts and threats in the deep dreaming that aren't as frequently around, but can show up."
"Ally: Got it, cool, cool, cool."
"Brennan: Pete, give me an Arcana check and I'm gonna say other than Esther, what if anyone had called out to anybody else to come sort of check in during this time?"
"Lou: Who's the oldest person I know like the old… who's the oldest person I am like, who's been in the city the longest?"
"Brennan: Damn, that's a great question."
Zac: Wally? [laughs] No.
Lou: Wally.
"Brennan: First of all, I think, something about— I think something about Kingston probably goes back weirdly to that one afternoon you spent with the dragon of Bleecker Street."
"Lou: I, yeah."
"Brennan: And I think you have memories of, you never heard from the dragon again and could never find that subway station again."
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: But I think that your mind moves off of that for a while. It also was like, you are what you knew at the time somewhat and now know is that the dragon on Bleecker Street found you on what was probably its last day after being in the city and nearly forever like the dragon, you heard its heart slowing in a way that happens as people are letting go. Yeah. Other than that, Orlando and Rovias, Rovias, by the way, reconstructed!"
Siobhan: Yay!
Lou: The lions?
"Brennan: The lions, both lions are back. Patience and Fortitude are both back."
Zac: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Nice thing about constructs, magical constructs is, that they can sometimes be fixed! Em is very old, about 1800's, Willy is similarly old. Willy's been around since the 1800's as well."
"Lou: I think that, given that what you've given me is like, I think more just where my head's at. I don't think I'm calling them to this meeting, but I think there are people Kingston is thinking he'd like to check in with with regard to moments of change in the city."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, great, great, great and then obviously in other realms, Nod is incredibly old and also your guys’ friend Rowan Berry who is sort of checked out, but Rowan Berry has been here in some form or another since the very beginning. You guys see… hold on one second."
Ally: You want me to roll Arcana?
"Brennan: Yeah, give me that Arcana roll Pete."
"Ally: That is 9, 24."
"[quiet, dark, dreamlike piano music]"
"Brennan: As Sofia talks about the deeper dreaming I think Pete, some of that squares with Pete as well. Because you, it's pretty clear on examination that the fact that Nod mirrors so closely to New York City, doesn't imply that everybody in the world, when they dream, comes to a magical version of New York. That in the way that Kingston is the voice, not of all people in the world, but is the voice of the people of New York City. You are the voice specifically of Nod of the Sixth Borough, which is the dreaming, which is the fullness of the dreaming realm. But it's the fullness of the dreaming realm as it reflects New York City. And so in a weird way, when Sofia talks about the deeper dreaming, you check in with your memories from the Metropolitan Museum of Memories on a 24, give me not only an Arcana, but give me a History check as well."
Emily: Can I maybe give him a help action since—
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: I'm kind of like telling him stuff that I don't know if I shouldn't be telling him, but,"
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure."
Ally: 15\.
"Brennan: 15\. So the 15 doesn't pull up anything because, Pete you find, there are holes in the Metropolitan Museum of Memories, there have been a couple of Vox Phantasmi throughout New York City's history. In the museum, the majority of them, you have visions of their deaths of like how they passed or like if they died in battle or something like that, which lets you know that, which lets you know that there are ways for Nod to retrieve the memories of Vox Phantasmi without them having to give it themselves. Like in other words, it's like, okay, someone died in battle and that memory made it to the Metropolitan Museum of Memories, obviously the dream realm had some way of collecting it without the, with them already being posthumous. There are one or two of the Vox Phantasma throughout New York City's history that don't have their final memories recorded in the museum."
"Brennan: And again, your relationship to those memories is very like organic and chaotic. It's not like you have a Dewey Decimal System for them. It's just that like you absorbed those memories into yourself and you recall them like a person recalls their own memories. Like when something sort of moves it. But now that you're like really racking your brain... there are chapters missing from the end of different Vox Phantasmi like throughout New York. And you find a commonality in the ones who the end of their lives vanishes. And they also vanished from having been that for people, which is... in one or two different occasions a Vox Phantasma has saw fit to try to go deeper into dreaming past the Sixth Borough."
Ally: Do I have their names?
Brennan: Yes you do.
Lou: Whoa. [wiggles his shoulders]
"Brennan: Hold on one second, let me go find this somewhere. The two Vox Phantasma that you find that you don't have their final memories within the museum. The first one is Hans Fischer. Hans was a Hessian… Sorry, Hans was not Hessian, Hans was a German soldier, that was a mercenary who quit the army and became a New York dilettante in 1775 and disappears from memory in 1783. So this is old, old long time ago in New York, but he was the Vox Phantasma for a period of time. And there are memories of Hans back in that time that you bizarrely understand, even though you don't speak German, of this, of him having a curiosity about having discovered what was further back in there. The other Vox Phantasma is one that you already know about, Josefina Gatsby, who was an heiress impossibly wealthy woman who was Vox Phantasma starting in 1920. And in 1929, she just vanishes. And you do have more records of that time period."
"Emily: Pete, do you think you would share this information with me?"
"Ally: Yeah, I think so."
Emily: Okay cool. I wasn't sure if I should write it down and know it or not.
"Ally: Yeah, I think I would."
"Brennan: Pete, you have memories... There's one memory in particular you're… you're doing anything almost like in your head of like rolodexing through memories, you see a memory for a second and you're like flitting past it. It's Josefina in this incredible opulent manor house like penthouse looking at a mirror and you know from Josefina's memories and that sort of weirdly intimate thing about the different Vox Phantasma is, how much of these people's lives you remember. Josefina towards the end of her period as Vox Phantasma before she disappeared, struggled a lot with heartbreak. The feeling that she was not close to anyone and didn't know any people and began to feel in the last couple of years of her time as Vox Phantasma, that she had no connection to the city of New York anymore. She struggled with loneliness, though they didn't have the modern language at the time for it. You see her struggling with addiction, struggling with isolation in her memories. And it's pretty intense. You watch her spiral out, become completely unattached to anyone or anything in the waking world because there never were Vox Phantasma or Populi at the same time in New York City's history until you and Kingston. You see that 1920s New York, it's crazy. It's the roaring 20's and there's a… no one is kind of there is no voice in her life of groundedness. There is no voice in her life of connecting to real things and real people. And you're flipping through these memories and I may be on some personal level aware that she doesn't have a Kingston in her life and she whoo, whoo, whoo, moves through stuff. You see, you move past a memory in that way where you're like flicking through channels so fast that when you see your channel, you are already three past it. Like you're scrolling too fast kind of. For a moment you see her looking in a mirror and instead of seeing her reflection, there's nothing there, but there's something wrong with her reflection. And by the time you move back to that memory, that memory is gone."
"[low, ominous music]"
"Brennan: Almost like you, maybe you made it up. It's not there anymore. That's what, so that's what Pete feels in that moment."
"Ally: Can, is there any way to like go to the Metropolitan Museum of Memories and see if the memory is there?"
"Brennan: You absolutely could do that, also lemme—"
Ally: That's something I can do eventually.
"Brennan: Yeah, and that all occurs internally in your head for… So like Sofia, you're watching Pete as he kind of goes glassy-eyed like, as people that are like falling into their own heads do, but Pete, you come to and see Sofia kind of looking at you. So if you wanna share that knowledge."
Ally: I think... [laughs]
"Pete: Hey, what's up. [laughs]"
"Sofia: Hey, sorry."
"Ally: Yeah, I share—"
Sofia: You went all glassy-eyed and I just creepily watched you.
"Pete: Yeah, well, yeah so I have these..."
"Ally: And then I relay, I think just all of that and maybe see if you would want to go to the Met Memories Museum."
"Sofia: Yeah, absolutely."
Pete: Cool.
Sofia: Yeah.
"Zac: Ricky would probably mention to everyone, like,"
Ricky: I don't know if we really rounded up about what that train was about.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: Oh yeah, I think like, I guess like… sort of like the stuff that Sofia said to Pete, I think like we kind of tell everyone."
"Brennan: Yeah, I think you is kind of are having a little impromptu war counseling here, walking through the hospital doors by the way, you see that the hospital door that is partially like, actually is fully closed into Kingston's room. The door opens, but the rest of the hospital is not through it. You see the Gramercy Occult Society through it as Esther is doing some rad doorway teleportation."
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: So she walks through, opens it goes,"
Esther: Oh! Sorry.
"Brennan: Closes, knocks on the door from the other side, and says,"
"Esther: Kingston, okay to come in? Sorry, frazzled."
Kingston: Of course. [laughs] Always welcome in here.
"Brennan: She walks in. She walks up to you Kingston, gives you a big hug, it's good to see you. You guys have, I think gotten together over the years because Alejandro was your best friend and was her mentor. And you see, she gives you a big hug. She is, you see like… has a very last minute sort of Halloween costume put together, which is basically her wearing her jacket that she likes, but has a little like cat nose and makeup of her being like, shit! Today's Halloween."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: But you see coming in behind her, both doing their vampire float and giggling, are Ana and Amelia Ortiz, Alejandro's granddaughters who come in, who are both, they have… they are having a ball, fangs distended, these two vampire wizards float into the room. You see, like Ana has like a sort of black fishnet shirt. The other one they sort of are like a very casual goth, nowhere near Cody,"
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: But they're like, they're like dressed for, they're like basically just like having a ball dressed for Halloween. They don't need costumes cause they can just run around and ease the Umbral Arcana around them and be two vampires having a ball tonight."
"Murph: I think for Cody, since he's seen skeletons and zombies and stuff today, I think when they come in, he gets super excited and leans into Kingston he goes,"
"Cody: Is, are these actual vampires, or is this—"
"Kingston: Actual vampires, but like good ones. There are a lot of vampires you shouldn't trust. These two, great girls."
Murph: Cody gets insanely pumped and just like straightens up.
Zac: Just so worried for the conversation that Cody has.
"Iga: Look, I just wanna say, this seems like a war council type situation. I'm just here to get my box looked at. I just need somebody to look at this chest. I don't need to be involved in this whole shenanigans—"
Kingston: Are you talking about--?
Iga: With jumping around.
Kingston: Uh-huh.
"Sofia: Are you sure? [crosstalk] Madam Anastasia, you were electric!"
"Iga: It's not, I'm not, it's like a literal box."
"Siobhan: Like I pull the box out like,"
Iga: This is not—
"Kingston: Oh okay, great."
[Ally laughs]
Iga: I'm not here for any kind of gynecological—
Pete: What's going on?
Iga: —situation. It is literally a box.
"Ricky: I could get my sister, y’know."
Iga: I helped you in the fights—
"Kingston: I would never have done it, that's not my—"
"Sofia: Actually I have a really good gynecologist, so—"
Iga: I have an excellent gynecologist. She's from the ha... is very good.
"Kingston: Well, let's get the box on the table. And Esther, maybe you can take a look at it or anybody who's got an awareness for magical items."
"Brennan: Esther, Esther nods—"
Sofia: What about that guy who puts things up his ass and Identified—
"Iga: No, we are not putting my box up anybody's ass. I know him."
"Kingston: That guy, I think is not— His speci—"
"Iga: I don't think he needs to put things up his ass, I think he just like it. We’re not—"
"Ricky: Safety-wise, I'm worried about it expanding."
[group laughs]
"Sofia: [crosstalk] Okay okay, am sorry I just felt like it was in the air and no one was gonna say it, so I said it."
Iga: [crosstalk] I am worried about it because I think he would like it.
"Brennan: Esther, I'm gonna make a roll for Esther here."
"Brennan rolls, then puts his hands over his mouth briefly."
Siobhan: What’s with that little smile?
"Brennan: She scans the box and, Iga you see, her cover the box in runes. She raises an eyebrow and goes,"
"Esther: This is powerfully warded. This is covered in a tremendous, tremendous amount of nondetections, abjurations, wards to, kept this from being found. There... A lot of the wards on this… Sorry and what is your name, madam?"
"Iga: I am Anastasia, if you would like to come for a reading, I am at 72nd and Columbus, you will know where to find me."
[Lou laughs]
Sofia: She's amazing. I still—
Pete: I actually would love to.
"Iga: Please do, I will give you a very good rate for my readings."
Zac: I hand Iga a cup of coffee.
"Iga: Thank you. Thank you, what a nice boy. He's a nice boy."
"Brennan: You see Esther, squints her eyes at you and says,"
"Esther: What's crazy is, I know that tarot is real and works. And I still feel like I'm partially being scammed. Is that—"
[group laughs]
"Sofia: She's amazing, changed my life."
"Iga: But you like it. This is part of it, you see people like to be scammed a little bit."
"Brennan: You see she shrugs, you see she says,"
"Pete: Ooh, I can’t wait."
"Esther: Ana, Amelia, do you guys want to take a look at the box here?"
"Brennan: You see Ana and Amelia go,"
"Twins: Hell yeah, we'll take a look."
"Brennan: And come over and, they stand on either side, [magical energy humming] see that their eyes go kind of blood red, as they cast Divinations on the chest,"
"Kingston: Cody, calm down, Cody relax, all right just relax."
"Cody: I just feel like I should help, if we're doing dark lord stuff, then I have… we fought a werewolf today. They’re natural enemies. And I feel like we're all a part of this."
Murph: And I just look at the vampires.
"Brennan: You see that Ana and Amelia both looking, they both look at Cody and one of them turns to look over at, they both sort of look over at Kingston and go,"
"Twins: Is this guy like, okay?"
"Kingston: Yeah he's new, he's new."
Pete signals “no” by waving his hand in front of his neck.
(group laughs)
"Sofia: Not yet, not yet."
"Kingston: He’s new, he's adjusting."
Zac: You're still like 40 year old right now.
[group laughs)
"Cody: I’m not actually 40. I don't know how old everybody is here, but I'm 27."
"Sofia: Oh, he's 27."
"Brennan: You said they both look at… both these like college age girls look over at you saying “I'm actually 27,” and they're like,"
"Twins: Cool, okay."
[group laughs]
"Pete: Whoa, really young."
"Cody: I thought, vamp— You're like 400 years old, right?"
Twins: We got turned into vampires like three years ago. We would be still younger than you if we were still human.
"Murph: [laughing] Cody goes,"
"Cody: Ah, the healing is fucking me up."
Murph: Cody pretends to pass out.
[group laughs]
"Brennan: You see that Ana talks to you, Kingston about this, and Amelia comes over to you, Pete. And it's like,"
"Amelia: Is that dude a vampire, or is he just like super sick?"
"Pete: He, no, that's actually my roommate."
[Brennan wheezes in laughter]
"Pete: His name's Cody, he's cool. He's, um, he sold his soul to kind of like a devil's friend."
[group laughs]
"Pete: Not quite a devil, just kinda peripheral devil."
"Brennan: You see in your chest Cody you hear it in your mind again, Bazathrax go,"
"Bazathrax: Dude are they talking about me out there, what are people saying?"
"Cody: [whispering] Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, we have to be fucking quiet, fuck!"
"Bazathrax: Dude, listen, did you not see what you did on that subway? That shit was sick as hell dude. Did I not tell you, you're gonna get powers? Don't shit on—"
"Cody: [still whispering] It was awesome. It was worth it. You fucking hooked me up, you fucking hooked me up."
[group laughs]
"Cody: I'm gonna act like we're not fucking friends in real life, but we're so fucking tight in here, okay."
"Bazathrax: That's what I'm saying dude, I'm trapped in your chest. So for the time being I'm hitching a ride, okay? And if I'm hitching a ride, that means that you gonna be a hot ride, baby. We're gonna soup you up, it's Ferrari time, okay?"
Cody: I would do it all over again. This was the best fucking day of my life.
"Brennan: You hear Bazathrax say,"
"Bazathrax: Dude, I'm putting feelers out all over the city. There's some crazy shit going on. It's a fucking free for all out here babe. Listen, I know you keep talking about wanting to get traded and shit like that, but I'm not gonna trade you 'cause here's the thing you kick ass dude. I don't know where you got that sword from that sword is sick as hell, baby okay?"
"Cody: I got it on Etsy. Etsy. It actually, yeah."
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
Bazathrax: Hell yeah.
Cody: Pretty good stuff.
"Bazathrax: That's what I'm talking about. So listen, devils, those weird Highway Hex or whatever... Nobody’s looking, okay? There's no upper management that can get here, but let me tell you something. Something's fucking up dude. The other wards and protections on the city right now with this, there's like a substance everywhere around us in this city that's like, a haze or something like that. You could throw down here and get some shit going and nobody will be able to tell dude, here's the thing, I can't trade you to another devil in hell, but there are a lot of other renegades out there. Other devils that have escaped the nine hells. And if you want, I could send some invites and we could get a fucking party going here. You wanna command lesser devils? you want, imps and other kind of minions and shit do your dark bidding, you want that?"
"Cody: [nodding] Yes, absolutely, I fucking want that."
[Brennan laughs]
Iga: Why is he nodding to himself?
"Ricky: Cody, Cody. What are you saying?"
"Kingston: Yeah, what do you want?"
"Murph: Yeah, Cody is talking out loud."
[player crosstalk all around]
Sofia: We’re hearing one side of the conversation and—
Cody: Good talk.
"Ricky: I just heard you say “yes, I want that”, and you’re looking straight forward."
"Iga: Inside voice, Cody."
"Cody: Okay, um. [clears throat]"
Sofia: I also heard you say—
Pete: You're grunting.
"Sofia: “I’m gonna pretend like we're not friends, but inside we're super tight.”"
[group laughs]
Cody: Okay.
Pete: And then “you hooked me up.”
Murph: [laughs] Cody… And then “this is the best day of my life.”
Ally: “You hooked me up.”
Emily: He did say that it’s the best day of his life.
Murph: I forgot that it is canon that Cody talks out loud when he talks to his devil.
[group laughs]
"Murph: So I think Cody swings his legs over, and he like pops back up,"
"Cody: [grunts] I've recovered. The devil within me has brought me back. So listen, I know we're all really concerned about Goliath and them closing down the mall—"
Sofia: Gladiator.
"Cody: Gladiator, right. I'm just pissed at corporations in general and..."
"Sofia: Hey, Goliath is one of the better corporations."
"Iga: No, there's no ethical concern for them, they’re capitalists."
"Sofia: I know you're right, you're right."
"Sofia: I'm just saying, when I'm choosing between Goliath and Gladiator, I choose Goliath, go on."
[Murph laughs]
"Cody: So yeah, the devil that lives inside me, God, it feels so fucking cool to say that says that there's like other devils and shit that can help us and they're just like around."
"Pete: [suspiciously] Oh, whoa."
Cody: So.
"Ricky: I, you know."
Cody: And there’s other renegades.
"Ally: [to everyone but Cody] Can I talk to you guys for a second, can we like go away from Cody and be like,"
Pete: That might be so cool!
"Sofia: [to Cody] That's a really good, thank you so much for bringing that up, kid."
Pete: Man.
Emily: And then we walk away.
"Sofia: Madam Anastasia, come with us, come with us."
Ally: So it's all of us.
"Pete: Madam Anastasia, you're fucking cool."
"Sofia: Yeah, you're fucking cool, come with us."
"Ricky: You know, it feels like he's got a lot to figure out and maybe there are bigger problems at the moment, but we should probably keep an eye on this guy."
[Murph laughs]
Sofia: Yeah.
"Kingston: Yeah, I think it’s good to keep—"
Pete: Should we see if he can bring the devils here and we can talk to them?
"Kingston: Well, I think I'm more interested in why there are so many devils within reach. And I'm wondering if—"
Pete is nodding slowly.
Sofia: That's what I’m thinking.
Kingston: —it has something to do with the emergence of antipopuli and perhaps this dreaming stuff that Sofia and Pete had been talking about.
"Sofia: Yeah, I think that maybe it might benefit us to be straightforward with this kid and say, you know,"
Kingston: Yeah.
"Sofia: You got this one devil, that's enough for now."
Kingston: Yeah.
Sofia: But please tell us anything that this devil is saying. I don't know if the kid will be okay with that?
"Pete: I live with him so I could just keep an eye on him, is it,"
Kingston: Yeah.
Pete: Yeah.
Sofia: Yeah. And it's good.
"Pete: He's cool, he's cool though."
Sofia: How are you feeling Madam Anastasia? This was a lot to throw at you. I know you were just trying to get your box.
"Iga: Yes, I mean look it's not a lot to throw at me in terms of—"
Pete: Just trying to get your box serviced. I’m so sorry.
[group chuckles]
"Iga: I just need to get my box serviced. It's an oil change type situation for me. I don't really want devils running around the city anyway. Like if I have to, I will do something, but."
Ally: Did we see some of that material sink into her box? [giggles] Did we see that like insane Umbral Arcana?
"Brennan: Iga did, you saw some of that haze, some of that like raw Umbral Arcana sink into the chest while you were at the subway platform still, but I don't know if you've mentioned that or not."
Siobhan: I have not.
"Ally: Yeah, we didn't see it."
"Lou: Have the Gramercy Occult Society people, have they learned anything about the box or—"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: So yeah, you see again, Esther looks over and says,"
"Esther: Look, this box is extremely warded."
"Brennan: Ana and Amelia both nod and they say,"
"Twins: Has anyone, like detected this from like a non wizard standpoint? Like, does anyone know if there's like fiendish stuff in it or divine stuff in it?"
"Ricky: I used, hey what's going on? I'm gonna—"
"Brennan: You see they go,"
"The Twins: Hey Ricky, good to see you."
"Ricky: Good to see you. Look, I used my Divine Sense on it and detected something not like other stuff that I've seen before. Y’know, it wasn't infernal or fae or whatever, it was something, uh… different?"
[gentle bassline begins to play]
"Iga: I mean, you can look at it from the inside, if that's easier, it might be that the wards are on the outside, on the inside it's a different situation."
"Sofia: Oh, we can open it?"
"Iga: No. You absolutely under no circumstances can open the box, but you can go inside it."
Cody: I will definite—
"Iga: It is a magical box, I don't know what to tell you. Doesn't obey the laws of physics."
Sofia: I would love to go inside that box.
"Kingston: Yeah, how does that work?"
Sofia: [quietly] Sounds cool.
Iga: I can take five of you inside the box.
"Ricky: Well, hold on first…"
"Cody: Let’s go, right?"
"Iga: So probably the wizards,"
Pete: I feel like I shouldn't do that with my memories of all the Voxes disappearing.
[Brennan laughs]
"Sofia: Okay, okay that's good—"
Iga: The Voxes inside the boxes?
Zac: I wanna try to sidebar with Esther before we go in a box.
"Brennan: Yeah. You see, yeah, Esther, Esther sidebars with you and she says,"
"Esther: Hey hun, how was the fight in the subway, you okay?"
Ricky: Yeah I got a couple of little spider guys on my back.
Esther sucks in a concerned breath.
Esther: Ahh.
Ricky: I love your costume by the way.
Esther: Thank you.
Ricky: You look exactly like some sort of cat.
"Esther: I look like a cat dressed as a woman who was working on Halloween, but I appreciate it."
"Ricky: That's awesome, that's a really specific costume. Yeah, does that mean anything to you, the like, the fact that it wasn't, a type of magic that…"
Zac: I list the other ones that—
"Esther: On one level, it's encouraging because we know that we're not dealing with the undead or with fiends or something like that. Another level, the part of me that likes to solve problems and to know information is not happy, that there's a huge question mark here. I think, look… unless the trick is this, Either we need a full Identify on it and I won't be able to identify it. There's two things we can do and we could do both of them, but we need to do at least one of them. One is for, I think Madam Anastasia to be more forthcoming about what that box is and what her relationship to it is. Or we need to find someone who can cast Identify very powerfully."
Ricky: Like that guy's butthole.
Esther: [nodding] Kind of—
Emily: [arms up in victory] I was right!
"Esther: It's unfortunate— Unfortunately I mean, it's a huge boon that the chest can be shrunk down. I mean, that's already feels like a huge boon to us, but I'm not, I don't feel comfortable suggesting that, I just met Madam Anastasia right now, but..."
"Ricky: I'll do it, I think I should say it."
Esther: Yeah.
[Emily laughs]
"Ricky: Madam Anastasia, it sounds like it could be cool to go in the box, but before we do that, would you care if we put it up a man's asshole?"
"Iga: Are you asking me if I would care, if you put my family's heirloom that I get all of my magical power from,"
Ricky nods very seriously.
Iga: Up this little creep's butt?
"Kingston: Oh his name is Lowell,"
Iga: Yes I would care about that.
"Kingston: He's not a creep, he's not a creep--"
"Iga: He's a creep. I have meet Lowell, he is a creep."
Kingston: He is not a creep.
"Pete: He can put it in a condom, right?"
Sofia: Oh yeah.
Ricky: He could put some sort of protective layer on it.
Cody: Jackass style. Did you guys see the first Jackass film?
Pete: That would be fine.
Iga: Would that work with a spell?
"Cody: Yeah, this is— It’ll be fine."
Brennan: You see Esther looks and says
"Esther: First of all, timeout, stop, Madam Anastasia that's a pretty big revelation. You get all of your magic from this chest. What sort of magic do you wield from it, and what… Madam Anastasia look--"
"Iga: Look man, I don't ask questions about the chest, the chest gives us power, we have the power. You ask questions, you get more questions. It's not a question-based box, it's a power-based box."
"Brennan: You say that, you see Esther like furrows her brows goes,"
Esther: Mm mm mm.
Iga: Just mind your business.
"Ally: Okay wait, Lowell has a lot of money, right?"
"Brennan: Lowell has a thriving artifact business, he sells artifacts, yeah."
"Pete: So what if we set up a reading? I'm sure he's so interested in the Occult. What if you gave Lowell a reading for some insanely high rate, then you get paid, the chest is in his ass, you're reading some cards for him..."
Kingston: And New York is saved!
"Pete: I’m sure Lowell would love it. Lowell owes us one, if we're gonna give him one of these."
"Iga: I mean, I would give him a reading in exchange for a reading, I guess, but God damn, if he does not have some kind of wet wipe hand sanitizer situation."
"Pete: Yeah, Oh he has the whole process, I'm sure he's got a whole kit that rolls out—"
(group chattering)
"Iga: Because this is a very porous wood. I'm just thinking about the liquids, that could seep into it, that's pretty nasty—"
"Cody: I say we do we just do a buttoned-up Jackass style, we do it with a condom."
"Pete: Yeah. You, look, if Lowell is constantly putting things up his ass, he's douching, he's clean, all right?"
Sofia: That’s what I was gonna say.
"Pete: Sphincter to sphincter, there's nothing in there. So let's go throw your family heirloom in between those two sphincters and find out what it is."
Kingston: There's two sphincters? Lowell only has one sphincter.
"Pete: No, everyone has two sphincters, people, wake up! [tapping his forehead]"
[group laughs]
Kingston: Okay Pete.
"Sofia: Um, okay, yeah."
"Brennan: You see, as Anastasia is talking to Pete, you see Esther is just shaking her head. Looks over at you Sofia and is like,"
Esther: I want to be very clear. Your relationship with La Gran Gata is beautiful and very important to the city.
Sofia: Right. Uh-huh.
"Esther: This is what drives me fucking crazy about warlocks. Could you hear that? Like no curiosity about how the power works. Just like there's a box, we get our spells from it. I don't ask questions, like what is that?"
"Sofia: I'm gonna tell you the thing that's fucking me up the most is that I really believe she was a psychic, but she can't tell me what's going on with the box."
[Brennan laughs]
Sofia: So it kind of puts every single reading she's given me in to like a miasma of uncertainty. I'm feeling a little scammed.
"Brennan: You see that, yeah, she nods her head and says,"
"Esther: Yeah. How much is she charging, or is that too personal to ask? I don't wanna get into--"
"Sofia: No, that's fine. I don't give a shit about money, $200 a reading."
"Esther: Wow, okay."
"Sofia: Yeah. And if I get good, if I get like good cards, then she charges extra."
Esther: She does a fee based on how good the future's gonna be?
"Sofia: Yeah, like if it's a good reading, then it's like, Oh, okay, well."
Ally: Wow.
"Sofia: And so I have to, yeah."
"Esther: God, oh, Sofie, okay yeah, for sure, for sure, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Sofia: I think that I'm looking for guidance from everyone but myself.
(laughs)
"Brennan: Kingston, you got a hit back from Lowell. On your phone he says,"
"Lowell: Kingston, great to hear from you."
"Brennan: And you see, by the way, he has a set up, he sends you, your little text history thread with him is him sending you receipts from, he demands that you take a finder's fee. Anytime artifacts come up from ""The Unsleeping City."" I don't know if Kingston could demand that he do something else with that money. But he's very adamant about anytime, (chuckles) an artifact is—"
"Lou: Yeah. It all gets donated to community centers. Kingston wants nothing to do with his, butt money."
[group laughs]
Brennan: You see the—
Ally: You give it to Ricky's shelter or something.
"Lou: Yeah, exactly I give it to like Helping Hands."
"Brennan: So just like a thing of Lowell's donation receipts to helping hands from the artifacts that are sold. And he also does, anytime there's an artifact that he thinks is would be like dangerous to sell. Most of them are pretty common or don't do things that are that destructive or dangerous. You see he goes like, “Hey, busy schedule over the next two weeks.” Texting you like,"
"Lowell: Hey Kingston, great to hear from you. We've got a busy schedule over the next two weeks, but I should be able to “squeeze it in” sometime closer, to probably like the 15th."
"Kingston: Laugh Out Loud. We'll see if we can wait that long, but maybe might need to, this might be a more pressing matter, hope you're staying clean, Kingston."
"Brennan: You see that (chuckles) yeah. He says,"
"Lowell: If it's a rush job, I can try to move it ahead of the line. Probably get it into the next few days."
"Kingston: Good to know, thank you Lowell."
Brennan: Rad—
Lou: And I communicate that to everyone else that
"Kingston: Lowell is not… could not do it in this immediate moment, but if we waited we might be able to put his talents to use."
Pete: He needs time to prep.
"Cody: So is this like… another, Madam Anastasia, is this like another dimension or something, that's in the chest, or like we can go in there?"
Iga: We can go in there. I don't know if it's another dimension. It's just like a really nice—
Cody: Have you been in there?
"Iga: Yes! I go in there all the time, it's very soothing. I have two children. Sometimes you just need a little bit of a break. You go inside the box for 10 minutes. You're rested, it's a good time. You go about your day, it’s nice!"
"Sofia: Oh, that's nice."
"Iga: It’s nice, it's nice in there—"
Pete: Did you furnish it?
"Iga: No, it came fully furnished, I don't know what to tell you, it's nice in the box!"
Sofia: What is the furnish like? Okay.
"Cody: If she's gone in there, we can just fucking go in there."
"Sofia: I wouldn't mind going in there, I'm very curious."
"Kingston: Yeah, Madam Anastasia—"
Pete: I'll keep watch…
[Murph and Emily laugh]
"Kingston: I just wanna say, of course I wanna be respectful of your privacy. You've made choices in your life with regard to your relationship to The Unsleeping City that I'm not going to ask you to erode or change. However, you have to understand that we are in a position right now where the city, something big is happening right now, and your box seems to either be in connection to that or aware of that. And so if there's anything you can do to help us help this city, I understand that it would be an infringement on you, but there might be something you could do."
"Iga: Look, this city has always changed. That is the nature of New York City. It's a beautiful thing that the city is always in flux. Everybody's like, “Oh, I miss the city from five years ago, ten years ago, twenty years ago.” It's all the same people from 20 years in the future will be saying, “Oh I miss it, this New York that I am sort of making up in my head that is from 20 years ago.” That's the nature of it, this is a changing place."
[slightly ominous string music]
"Brennan: Kingston, go ahead and give me a Persuasion check if you would be so kind."
"Lou: Wow, really suckin' it today. That's gonna be 12."
"Brennan: 12, okay copy that. You see Ana and Amelia are both looking around. Esther also looks over at you, Anastasia, says"
"Esther: To reiterate the words again of, the Vox Populi, [clears throat pointedly]"
Brennan: Sofia you can tell Esther is like not—
"Iga: I didn't vote for him. I like him, I didn't vote for him."
"Brennan: You see Esther (mumbles)... You can see Ricky, you can tell your partner is approaching the edge right now. She goes,"
"Esther: Well, okay, understood. Obviously you get all your power from this chest. Mr. Masters has the ability to, hopefully illuminate some questions that maybe you have about the chest itself. Regardless, if you would like to extend us the courtesy of taking some of us into this pocket dimension, that could be potentially very helpful. Also, if you would be so kind as to even just expanding the chest out to its full size would maybe allow us some more insight into this. Again, we also want to keep you safe. And I understand that your desire here is to have the chest identified and appraised, to understand why it is changing, that is our goal as well, ultimately."
"Ricky: Well said, well said."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I expand it to full size."
"Brennan: You see more trees are gone and there are two figures on a street carved into the top of the box stretching away, an older man in a long coat with his hair tied back and a younger man next to him, holding a teapot in his hand."
"Iga: See this is, why are you on my box?"
"[players crosstalk, loudly]"
"Kingston: Yeah, I wanna know that too."
Pete: Why are we on your box?
"Sofia: See, I do wanna know that too but Madam—"
Kingston: Why are we on your box?
Cody: [aggressively] This is all Gladiator buildings popping up. Think about it.
"Iga: I’m sorry, Gladia—?"
"Sofia: Think that the kid has a point, because you say that the city's always been changing and that's what makes it what it is. But the city has been changed because of the people. But if it starts changing because of another reason, it might lose the charm of what it is. And even you, your box is changing and that's kind of bothering you. And that's probably how Kingston feels about his city."
"Iga: Look, I don't wanna cause a fight. I think that you people are good people. I think that you do what you did for good reasons. I'm not here to cause a fight. And if my box is the thing that is making this stuff happen, let's stop that from happening."
Pete: Okay.
Ally: Can I take a photo of the part where it's me and Kingston and try to figure out like which street or—
Brennan: Hell yeah--
Ally: Do I recognize the area?
Brennan: [mouth full of snack] Go ahead and give me a… you can give me a History check with advantage as well.
"Ally: Ooh, that’s right."
"Emily: I'll take a picture of where… I've to find out what building. I'm assuming it's Empire State Building, but..."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Ally: 15.
"Brennan: The detail, it's still very fairytale in, like, the art style of the carvings is very sort of mythical. Like you and Kingston on the street are like standing in the middle kind of heroically, just sort of presenting yourself to the street. But you do see, as it goes along, it has the same like number of lanes and like parked cars and stuff like that, kind of looks like 125th street. And yeah, Sofia the building that you and Ricky are on—"
Ally: Which is...
"Brennan: Kind of looks like the Empire State Building. 125th street is the main thoroughfare, where the Triborough bridge from Astoria you ride down 125th street all the time to get to Uncommon Knowledge, Kingston—"
Ally: And that where Kingston is. Okay.
Brennan: Kingston and St. Owen's are both right off 125th street.
"Cody: I also, when I met Lucifer personally, I found that book in the mall. I know you guys don't care about the fucking mall, but all of the shit is what happened to the mall. Think about it. [takes a drag from his tiny cigarette]"
"Pete: Dude, you may be right, you really might be right."
Sofia: Yeah.
Kingston: Stop. Smoking. In the hospital.
Ricky: You’re just gonna have to get rid of that.
Iga: You gotta not smoke.
"Cody: Every time I make a fucking cool point, I wanna smoke."
[Brennan laughs]
"Cody: I'm fuckin' sorry, alright? Goddammit."
"Pete: Hey, let's just get you like a—"
Iga: Where are you even getting these butts of cigarettes?
[group laughs]
Murph: [laughing] I just collect—
Sofia: They all look newly finished.
Iga: Little baggie.
Ally: You just have an altoid tin full of butts of cigarettes.
Murph nods in agreement.
"Cody: I save 'em, we're gonna pick this up after I'm done."
"Brennan: Esther looks at you Cody and says,"
"Esther: Very interesting… Also pleasure to meet you, um, Cody. I'm Esther Sinclair, I'm the head of the Gramercy Occult Society. These are two of our young wizards Ana and Amelia Ortiz."
"Cody: We've met, it was weird."
"Esther: Oh yes, understood. You say you encountered a Fiendish Codex within which, this is the Queens Center mall?"
"Cody: Yes. Yeah, I was going in, I was collecting some Adventure Time hats and Jack Skellington hoodies, as you do. And I saw a devil book and I opened it and I flipped through it. And then I saw a highway and then a devil reached his hand out and I pulled the devil into here. And then I sold my soul to him for powers, but we're all up front with it. And Pete sealed them in me now and we're cool."
"Esther: Huh, okay."
"Brennan: You see, Esther looks over to you Pete, goes,"
"Esther: Quick thinking, Pete. Good looking out."
Pete: Thanks.
"Brennan: Well you see, she looks over at your sheet,"
"Esther: Well, Mr. Walsh, that is um… excellent, okay, wonderful."
"Brennan: So Esther looks over, you guys still have, the chest in front of you? And Esther looks over at Madam Anastasia and says,"
"Esther: So ultimately I would highly recommend the wards on your chest, protecting it probably from the prying of wizards like me into your family's magical business, is preventing me from discerning more about the chest. Mr. Masters, I can almost guarantee you will be able to understand more fully what's going on. If you would like to take some of us into the chest to take a look around, we're happy to do that at the end of the day, we're happy to provide a service to you. It's not about us demanding that you do anything, whatever it is that you're comfortable doing."
Brennan: And you see that she waits for… to see what Madam Anastasia is going to say.
Iga: Would you like to come inside the chest?
"Brennan: Esther nods her head. Says,"
"Esther: Yes, that would be delightful."
"Brennan: You see that she looks and says,"
Esther: Would anyone else like to come inside or not?
"Sofia: I mean, yes."
Cody: Yes.
"Ricky: I will go, if Cody goes."
[group laughs]
"Ricky: Uh, or maybe I— [laughs]"
Sofia: I can keep an eye on him too.
Ricky: Okay.
"Cody: A rivalry, two sides of the same coin, lightness and darkness. [takes a drag]"
Kingston: That's—
Sofia: Okay. [reaches out like to grab his cigarette]
Iga: I— what—
Kingston: You have to stop. Stop. Stop.
Pete: You can't smoke in here!
"Zac: I’m gonna flip out one of your duster jacket pockets, to see if it's filled with a lot of cigarette butts."
"Iga: Again, you gotta wash this jacket man, it's nasty."
"Murph: Ziploc bags, full of cigarette butts that he collects and smokes."
"Ricky: We're just gonna get rid of these, we’re just gonna get rid of these."
Kingston: That's five right? so the five that you can fit inside the box.
Iga: Mm-hmm.
"Sofia: Oh, anyone can go in my place if they want, I just figured—"
"Kingston: No. No, Sofia, I think you should go."
"Sofia: Okay, I’m going."
Ally: So who's going? [counting on their fingers] Sofie—
"Brennan: Sofie, Esther, Ricky, Cody."
Zac puts his face in his hand and laughs.
"Iga: And I can take five people, so it's me plus five people."
"Ricky: Hey, can I sidebar with everybody but Cody for a second?"
[group laughs]
"Pete: Yeah, totally."
"Sofia: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Yeah what's going on?"
Kingston: What’s going on?
Ricky: Look.
Sofia: Yeah.
"Ricky: We all know that I love Cody, and I'm gonna do the work to love Cody."
Murph is losing it in the background.
Kingston: Yeah.
Ricky: Are we sure that—
"Pete: Keep talking about all this work that you gonna have to do,"
"Ricky: No, I love— Ricky loves everybody, and I love people—"
"Sofia: Ricky, do you know it's okay to not love everybody, right?"
"Ricky: Well, y’know, I mean, I hear that in theory."
Kingston: Yeah. I'm the Vox Populi and I don't like people.
"Ricky: Sure. And, that's your choice or you, that's how you feel. And I know that I will really like Cody,"
[Brennan wheezes in laughter]
"Ricky: Are we sure, are we 100% sure we want Cody to go in this magical box of mystery?"
"Sofia: I think that right now he's being controlled by a devil and could potentially have access to more devils. If we turn our back on him now, he's going to go to the devils."
Ricky: Okay.
"Pete: Yeah, I mean, he's honestly a cool guy. He seems maybe kind of harmless? What do we think?"
Sofia: Yeah.
"Ricky: He just needs some guidance, we were just saying he needs guidance."
Sofia: Yes.
Ricky: Cool. Awesome.
"Sofia: I think that, what Pete is providing for him is amazing for maybe both of them."
"Ricky: That's awesome. Cool, cool."
"Pete: Hey, maybe."
Ricky: That’s awesome.
"Pete: All right, so Kingston, do you wanna go as well or not?"
Kingston: I have such a—
Pete: There’s one more spot.
Kingston: I have such like a low understanding of like magical items that I feel like sending Ana or Amelia would probably be a better use.
Sofia: Ohhh...
Pete: Oh yeah.
Brennan: You see—
"Lou: Like, my Arcana is so low that any checks I would be making, like, I don't know. I'm not sure I could distill anything."
"Brennan: Esther actually looks at Ricky and Sofia, going into the chest and you can see that her faith in the two of you is unparalleled. And she says,"
"Esther: Actually, I kinda agree with Kingston, I'd like to stay out here and talk with the two Voxes if I can. Ana and Amelia, do you two wanna head in and give a sort of arcane appraisal to whatever's in there?"
"Brennan: And you see that Ana and Amelia both go like,"
"Twins: Oh my god, fun dimension adventure."
"Brennan: You see that they both look at each other, smile, thumbs up."
Sofia: [laughing] I can't wait to see how this is decorated.
"Ally: What do you guys have for Arcana, Ricky and Sofia?"
"Emily: Ah, not good."
"Zac: My Arcana’s not good, but I have—"
Brennan: Ana and Amelia--
Zac: Other things.
Murph: I also have Divine Sense.
"Brennan: Yeah, Ana and Amelia have dope--"
Sofia: I'm more there to make sure Cody doesn't freak out.
"Cody: I'm not gonna fucking freak out. The devils are on our side, guys."
"Kingston: You constantly yell that you're gonna freak out. You say that all the time. It's almost your catch phrase, ""I'm gonna freak out."""
[group laughs]
"Cody: That's when I killed the ghosts, that's what I did, I freaked out. Listen, the blade is a controlled weapon."
Murph: Pull out the sword. [whooshing]
Cody swings his sword around in demonstration.
"Kingston: Put it down, stop that--"
Iga: Swords inside a hospital.
"Sofia: Okay, okay, okay."
Iga: Very dangerous.
"Brennan: Cool. Ricky and Sofia, Cody, and then Ana and Amelia step forward in front of Anastasia."
"Siobhan: I clap my hands, I say,"
Iga: Open sesame.
[Emily laughs]
Siobhan: Ridiculous spiral of light goes all around us. And we're snapped into the box.
Ricky: Did she say “open sesame”?
"Brennan: You guys are standing on the balcony of a fairytale castle in an Alpine pine forest, wind whipping all around. The castle is both somehow beautiful in a fairy tale way and also like menacing. It has those tall conical towers that are almost like navy blue and a grayish white granite stone, parapets everywhere. The castle is built sort of like almost on a mountaintop and stretches up into the sky. The forest extends about a quarter of a mile in all directions, half a mile in all directions, and then just drops off. But you're standing on this incredible balcony overlooking behind you, there's a giant archway leading into the castle. You see it is daytime here, but there is no sun. The light is just ambient. So you see Ana and Amelia both go,"
"Twins: [hiss up at the sky] Oh shit okay, Oh my God that was so scary. We're good. We’re good, we’re good."
"Sofia: You kinda undersold it, when you said it was furnished. [laughs]"
Ricky: Sort of like a whole world.
"Iga: You know, you don't wanna brag."
Cody: Sort of like a full—
[Emily laughs]
"Sofia: Oh, that's very humble."
"Brennan: Anastasia, the woods used to extend to the horizon in all directions, a like primeval Polish, like Eastern European, alpine forest going in all directions. It used to stretch on forever and ever and ever. And now it ends in a kind of mist, just like luminous gray light, almost like this was just floating in unoccupied, medium lit grayness. But so to you, you guys are beholding a place of incredible wonder and fantasy. Anastasia, this place is less than the last time it was here."
"Iga: Okay, so all of this gray shit is new, and I don't, this is not… Okay, you're not actually seeing it at its best— It's very impressive, I know it."
"Cody: I actually think the mist is really cool. I think it makes this sort of like a cool vampire castle type situation,"
Sofia: You should AirBNB this.
Cody: If that’s what you were going for.
"Iga: No offense to you, but cool vampire castle is not what we're going for here."
[Emily laughs]
Cody: Interesting.
"Brennan: You see, Ana and Amelia both look at you guys and say,"
"Twins: Cool, we're going to do like a scan of the outside of the castle. Later!"
"Brennan: [magical poof] Two bats, they turn into two bats and they get to fly around, bound, you guys see visible sonar coming out of their mouth, like in expanding rings of sonar is like (high-pitched ringing) it's like sort of taking a scan of the outside of this castle. The rest of you are left here on the balcony, but the rest of the castle inside."
Iga: You want some tea?
[somber music begins to play]
Sofia: Absolutely. I'm really sorry that something's going on. If this is less than you're used to.
"Iga: Yes, it's, I feel like I have not done my duty to my family to be keeping this up, but, I don't know what I have done or what anybody else has done. This is very strange to me. I worry for my daughter, this is our inheritance. This is our--"
"Sofia: Wait, can I ask you a question about yourself? And you don't have to answer if you don't want, did your mother have these, you said it was passed from mother to daughter, right?"
Iga: Yes.
Sofia: So did your mother have these powers and then it wasn't until she passed that you received them?
"Iga: That's correct, I mean… the powers, I train my daughter in it, but for now it's all pretty theoretical. She's not actually, honestly that interested. She's just a kid, she's wanting to be with her friends, but it's important this cultural stuff."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Iga: To keep on passing it down generation to generation. And she'll like it when she gets it. It's you get it when you get it. Hopefully, God willing, she won't get it for a while."
Sofia: Yeah.
Iga: You know?
Sofia: Absolutely.
"Brennan: Iga, you are walking by a hallway of framed portraits of these, like you see there's one woman who has like 1960s hair and is very clearly like Iga's mom. You see there's like another woman past her, portrait. Go ahead, everybody here and give me a Perception check."
[ethereal music]
"Emily: Nat 20, does that mean I find out her name is Iga?"
[Ally gasps]
Emily: I just got a nat 20. [laughs]
"Brennan: Yes, you see that there's an empty frame at the beginning of the hallway that says Iga Lisowski under it doesn't have a portrait in it yet."
"Emily: Take a real quick picture, sly picture. [camera clicks]"
"Sofia: Hmm, interesting, who's Iga?"
Iga: You think people would come and take tarot readings from somebody called Iga?
Ricky: Your name’s Iga?
"Sofia: [nodding] Yeah, I absolutely would."
"Iga: Yes, but like don't… people expect a certain kind of service. You know what I mean? The readings are real, but the things around the readings, people needed to feel safe and secure."
"Sofia: Yeah, I like the name Iga, but I also like the name Madam Anastasia."
[group laughs]
Iga: Thank you.
"Brennan: You walk through the hall, on that Nat 20 perception, Sofia. The, everything in this castle is it seems like you're in a magical, extra dimensional space. There are rooms filled and piled high with treasure mountains of gold coins, swords, lances, tapestries around the edges where the frames touch these portraits, you see like water damage, which you only recognize as being like, there's like some fading, some cracks in the painting. You only recognize this because your brother Mario used to like work in like forged paintings. So you're looking at them and these aren't forgeries, but they are, getting damaged in a way from aging, which doesn't make sense for the realm you're in to you. It's like, this is a realm that should exist as pure fairytale. And some like element of time has been brought into it. And like the paintings are fading slightly."
"Emily: Can I point it out to Madam Anastasia or Iga, whichever she prefers, and just say,"
Sofia: Is that new or?
"Iga: Yes this is not… This is not normal. Misiek, Misiek, how are you feeling my little dragon?"
[Misiek makes some pathetic little moaning noises.]
"Iga: Yeah, me too, me too. That is how I'm also feeling."
Cody: I think I'm gonna go check out this mist.
Ricky: I will—
Cody: And see if it's in—
Ricky: Follow you.
[group laughs]
"Iga: You cannot, just walk out into the forest. This is a magical forest."
"Ricky: Wow, that's—"
Iga: Like maybe if you can fly. Can you fly?
"Cody: If you give me 10 minutes, I can summon a steed."
"Iga: That can fly, a flying steed? You cannot wander into a magical forest. That is a basic rule of magical forest. That is Magical Forest 101. You just cannot wander into it—"
"Cody: I need to go take a piss real quick, I just need to take a piss."
"Sofia: Not to mention Cody. This is, we are in Madam Anastasia's house right now. So we do have to respect Madam Anastasia's rules."
"Cody: There’s a magic forest in fucking fog, and we’re not gonna look at it?"
"Iga: I’m not, look, you can wander into magical forest on your own if you want to, you will get immediately lost."
"Ricky: I'll go with Cody. We’ll just walk around the forest a little bit, we’ll stay on the edge."
Iga: There will be strange things that will lure you out of your way.
Cody: We’re just gonna peek!
Ricky: Okay.
Cody: That's what we're gonna do!
"Brennan: Cody and Ricky, you guys head off to go peek Sofia and Madam Anastasia head to the kitchen to get that tea, Cody and Ricky, you guys head out to the forest. What do you guys do as you sort of go do… you go down many lower levels. Get rooms piled high with treasure, artifacts, huge like, samovars and lanterns and lamps and dangling chandeliers and all kinds of crazy shit in here."
"Murph: So, any swords?"
"Brennan: Oh shit, go ahead and give me—"
Sofia: This is someone else's house. This is someone else's house.
Cody: I'm gonna ask. I'm gonna ask.
Lou: [laughing] “I’m gonna ask.”
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Investigation check, both of you."
(Ally giggles)
"Lou: [crossing his fingers] Nat 20, Nat 20, Nat 20—"
"Cody: Ricky, look around for any swords. We're gonna ask!"
"Ricky: Looking around for swords, sure."
Murph: I got a nat 1.
[group laughs]
Emily: Aha! That's what you deserve.
Murph: What! I was gonna ask!
Zac: 18\. I got a 18.
Emily: Looking around Madam Anastasia's house like that.
Brennan: Cody—
Murph: You got a house full of treasure!
"Brennan: Cody, you go to touch a… There's an incredible like ruby-hilted scimitar, you go to touch it and your hand gets badly burned by the rubies in the hilt."
Ricky: Oh! Be careful.
Cody: Ah!
Brennan imitates quickly letting go of something hot.
"Zac: I think Ricky has the energy of like a dad trying to talk to his, like relate to a son. Yeah, like playing a video game."
(group laughs)
"Cody: Fuck, fuck! Did you see that? It must've belonged to like an angel or something."
"Ricky: Yeah, whoa, that’s pretty hot."
"Cody: [fanning his hand in the air] Or like rejects evil. Fuck dude, did you see that?"
"Ricky: Yeah, I did see it, I did."
[Murph laughs uncontrollably]
"Brennan: Ricky on 18, you see that there are, there's a wall of swords. There's a whole wall of swords. They're all behind locked glass. However, they look incredible and magical and awesome. And then there's an umbrella stand next to that glass case of swords that just has like one kind of like humble looking sword in it. It’s sort of just like, leather wrapped hilt, it doesn't, it's not shimmering or shining with magical potential. It looks like sort of what a medieval sword would look like."
Ricky: Huh.
"Zac: Ricky will, I guess, pick it up and be like,"
"Ricky: Hey, this is pretty cool. I don't know if you're interested in it, Cody."
"Cody: It's super, I'm interested in every sword yeah."
"Ricky: Here, why don't you—"
Lou: [laughing] “I’m interested in every sword.”
Zac: So I hand him the sword.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: I take the sword.
"Ricky: Pretty cool sword, right? Hey so, we're kind of similar, right? [chuckles] I feel like we—"
Cody: Two sides to the same coin.
"Ricky: You know, you keep saying that. I just think we've got… We sort of have similar things we can do. Maybe we get our powers from different things, but also, I think that's kinda interesting, right?"
"Cody: Yeah, I think sometimes you have to become a demon to defend an angel, if that makes sense."
Ricky: What is the angel?
[group laughs]
"Cody: Just the world? The mall, the mall is the angel."
"Ricky: Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well..."
Cody: There's sort of a Sasuke/Naruto thing going on with us.
Ricky: What's up?
[group laughs]
Cody: We should go look at the mist.
Brennan: [nearly laughing too hard to speak] You guys head out and go look at the mist.
Ally: “What's up?”
Murph: [laughing] Ricky definitely just like watches NCIS and nothing else.
Zac nods.
"Ricky: I'm not, I know of anime, wasn't quite my thing. It's cool that you like it."
[group laughs]
[whimsical orchestral music]
"Brennan: You guys, head out… In the kitchen Anastasia, you arrive, the kitchen is like a vast, there's like a huge 20 foot long butcher’s board in the middle of a vast multi-stove like this is a kitchen to like cook feasts in. And you see, there is an icicle-encrusted, like walk-in, ancient medieval freezer that has like a bank vault wheel on like the outside of it. There's like food and stuff in, and Iga, you know this place is like stocked non-stop."
"Iga: Mm-hmm, yeah, the food does not go bad here. It's just,"
Sofia: Oh!
"Iga: And it's just here. You can eat it, it's fine, it's not unlike eat the food, sell your soul situation. Just in case you were worried."
"Sofia: Hmm, I wasn't even thinking of that until you said that, but now I think I'm just gonna eat this Luna Bar in my pocket. Thank you."
"Iga: Okay. Well, I will have a cup of tea."
Ally: What flavor?
Iga: It’s good tea!
Ally: What flavor on the Luna bar?
Emily: [laughs] Lemon Zest. I love lemon-flavored granola bars.
"Brennan: Iga, Misiek flies ahead of you grabs a little thing and flies around it in the little circle to open the vault door so you can go in and grab some stuff. Anastasia or yeah, as you enter, Iga, you see that the splendor of the freezer is pure tons of food, giant haunches of like hunted elk and forest beasts and stuff like that. Every time you open the door, this place is fully stocked. You see that there is a big empty section on one of the shelves and this place is always replenished. You've never walked in here to see it empty before. The two plates that are empty, are a platter of sheep's cheese and a giant dish that every time you came in here was filled with borscht bites. And they're just gone."
"Iga: [blinks several times] Mm, who is eating my cheese? Is this a… Hmm, a small Polish child living in this ball? I do not like this, I do not like this one bit. People are taking my stuff. Hmm."
Siobhan: I get a lemon and sugar for the tea.
"Sofia: Madam Anastasia, I know that everyone's asking a lot of you right now, but you can also ask us if stuff is going on. I think if everyone's coming on strong, it's because, we like to help."
"Iga: No look, no, I get it, you're helpful people. You're good people. I just, you have to understand my people were persecuted for a very long time, it's not—"
"Sofia: Yeah, I know."
Iga: It was not like a good fun thing to have magical powers in Poland in the medieval period. Do you understand?
Sofia: Yeah.
"Iga: Like that was bad, that was not good. We have been trained to stay secret, and it has worked for us because when you get involved, bad things happen."
"Sofia: Absolutely, but I just want you to know that the people who are trying to help you right now, like magic, we love your magic. We wanna see it exactly how you want to see it."
"Iga: I'm gonna give you such a discount. I'm gonna give you such a discount, you will not believe."
Sofia: Thank you so much. Even though my faith in your services has been shaken. I will still be coming back.
"Iga: Hey, Sofie sometimes the reading is a real reading and sometimes the reading is what you need to hear. And that's just as important."
Sofia: Yeah.
Iga: Do you know what I mean?
"Sofia: Yeah I'll be honest. Like I mean, I think that you do charge way too much, but your readings are also true."
"Iga: I'm in the Upper West side, you want a cheap reader, you go to a different neighborhood you know what I mean."
Sofia: Exactly.
Iga: The rents are high.
Sofia: Yeah (laughs)
"Brennan: You two just ended having a lovely cup of tea here. Yeah, I think that, how is Iga feeling in this moment, especially this is the first time you've had other people in the chest with you probably for a while. And it's also very different to be this, there is something I think very potent here as well of like you being in halls that you know your mom and your grandmother and your great-grandmother and your great-great-grandmother, all walked in."
"Siobhan: I feel like it is like a safe space for her. It's a very calming space that she goes to when she needs to be alone. And it is a little weird having people there, because she hasn't welcomed anybody in for a long time. I think maybe even like her husband doesn't really come here. Like she has taken him here to show him, but really it's her space. So she likes these people. She likes that they're helping her, but it's still a little tense having people over. I feel like--"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. Ana and Amelia—"
Emily: Sofia is very respectful. She uses a coaster.
Iga: Thank you.
"Brennan: We’re gonna cut back to the hospital room that now just has a big magical chest Kingston, Pete and Esther. Esther looks over at the two of you. And basically just says,"
"Esther: Well, Voxes of New York City, how are we feeling about the scuffle on the subway, does this feel like routine Halloween shenanigans or does this feel like something else?"
Kingston: It's something else.
Pete: I think it's something else.
"Pete: Kingston, have you been noticing anything weird in your area, this like 125th Street area?"
"Kingston: We had a, not really I mean, one of the bigger electronic stores is sold, but I mean, that's not something so crazy. I'm more disturbed by this woman I talked to when she got off the subway, just the energy I got off of her, I don't know what, Madam Anastasia said about the city changing is right. But this change feels different. Something about places."
Pete: Hmm.
Kingston: Yeah.
"Lou: Ah, like, quick question, Brennan, that chest pain that I had before I got on the subway, is that tied to my physical being like Kingston, being an old man or the nature of what we were doing?"
Brennan: Give me a Medicine check.
Lou: Okay. That's a 25.
"Brennan: You like take a second now that the room is a little bit more intimate and you're just here with Pete and Esther to like, take your blood pressure. You're doing great, man, you're in great health. You scrapped hard in that fight and feel great. You believe that was something supernatural. You believe it was the presence, the antipopuli as a concept is all about, like, this thing exists in a miasma. Particles of it appear in the world as a supernatural element, but in doses so small that they're almost always microscopic. And what was there on that train was like a lethal dose. Something that can kill you if like a drop of it enters your bloodstream or your area, you respirate it or whatever. And it was physically tangibly there. This like, powerful hatred of New York. You feel like that was sort of beaten back. That stuff being there feels more like a fluke to you. The antipopuli, you don't think... That stuff is always around. You've never seen it congregate like that. In other words, to make it something like the raw, well, I guess you don't know necessarily about the raw Umbral Arcana thing yet. You know, that amounts of antipopuli like that only exists in Nod. They aren't found in the waking world like that, so—"
Ally: I was gonna ask you about your chest grab anyway. 'Cause I perceived…
Lou: Yeah.
"Ally: Um, so maybe we can just swap that info now. I can tell him about the raw that I saw, and—"
Lou: Yeah I think I pass along—
"Brennan: Yeah Kingston, so you guys confer and Esther hears this, where Pete you're basically like, yeah antipopuli probably got pushed here almost like when a wave of jellyfish gets washed up on the beach by the tide, the jellyfish sting you and are nasty. That's like the antipopuli, but that might be a fluke, that might not happen again. The tide coming in that strongly, that's a big problem. And the tide in this instance would be that raw Umbral Arcana."
"Ally: Yeah and specifically from where, if we can figure that out?"
"Brennan: Esther, as you guys share, this speaks up and she says,"
"Esther: Well, this is something that I just came across yesterday in Alejandro's old notes. The Umbral Engine, I was operating under a misconception from my years when back when I was just the Proctor of the Clinton Hill Chantry, that the Umbral Engine created the Umbral Arcana, that's not actually true. The Arcana is a naturally occurring substance within Nod and the umbral engine disseminates it and harnesses it to create what we call the Umbral Arcana is actually a specialized network of harnessed raw Arcana from or I guess like raw Umbra from the Sixth Borough. If you saw, you visibly saw it with the naked eye Pete?"
Pete nods.
Esther: [pushes her hand into her hair] Okay…
Pete: Yeah.
Esther: That's not great.
"Pete: It went under the subway, it went deep in somewhere else."
"Esther: Obviously there are ways for the Arcana to get into the city because we that's what we use to protect the Unsleeping City. But, if like you're saying there was enough of a concentration, A, that it was able to push through that much antipopuli to take over that subway car or that entire subway, then that... we got to talk to Sofia. She's been mentioning stuff like this for awhile. She's found some stuff at the monastery that I think might be worth us looking into."
"Pete: She told me about that too, yeah totally. Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: I think you see, she looks at you Pete and goes like,"
Esther: I think what we're experiencing here in the waking world. We're getting the ripples of something happening. Maybe not on this side.
Pete: Definitely.
Kingston: We're gonna have to go to Nod?
"Ally: I was gonna say, can I invite Nod here or gray baby?"
Brennan: Yes. Um—
[Emily laughs]
Lou: Gray Baby.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see Esther says,"
"Esther: Maybe it might, Pete obviously you're free to, if you wanna head into Nod, if you have business there, that's obviously your prerogative as the Vox Phantasma for us, for people that might need to take more precautions heading there,"
"Brennan: And you see Esther makes eye contact with Kingston here. She goes like,"
"Esther: I think starting at the monastery and at the society, it might be the place to start. But I think honestly,"
"Brennan: You see, she raises her hands, she’s like,"
"Esther: This might be a full court press scenario. We don't know where we're we gonna find the, find bingo here, but we should probably look across the board anyway."
"Brennan: So she nods… Ricky and Cody back in you guys moves to the forest, get to the gray edge of the forest here. You see, it's not really mist. The delineation is kind of sharp. The land just sort of falls away and it's not mist. It's more like just ambient gray light, just (pulses)."
"Zac: I guess I'll cast Divine Sense just to, I feel like—"
"Murph: Yeah, I wanna do the same thing and specifically mechanically I wanna kinda do a Religion check and see if I sense any of the same magic that I sensed from like, specifically Cody is looking to see if Gladiator has any ties to the supernatural."
Brennan: Are you doing a Divine Sense?
Murph: Yes.
"Brennan: Each of you guys can give me either Religion, Arcana or Perception if you want in this moment."
"Murph: Would it be, what are your stats? Would it be more helpful for one of us—"
"Zac: My perception’s, a lot. I get, do I still get a advantage on this perception?"
Brennan: Yes you do.
Zac: Okay. Cool.
"Murph: Oh sweet. So then I'll just make a Religion. Oh sorry, what did, what kinda checks did you say were okay?"
"Zac: Arcana, Perception, and Religion."
Brennan: Yeah.
Murph: Oh great. I'll make Religion.
Zac: I got a 18 Perception--
Murph: I got a 15.
"Brennan: Cool, when you cast Divine Sense, you get back either celestial, undead, fiendish, or whatever, or when you cast it, you will get back like, this is regular, this is mundane, but you get a reading, you get back no reading here. It's like the difference between something being the answer is no, versus just like N/A. Right? Like not applicable."
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: You don't, it's like nothing comes back out to you and on an eight— on a 15. Yeah, man you, the feeling you get in the pit of your stomach from not receiving information back from your Divine Sense Cody, is the feeling you got, when the wall in the mall that used to be full of like concert posters, became filled with like Gladiator campus arriving soon. You can't tell if that means they're magically connected. You feel a connection though, in terms of that thing of like reading like a Gladiator advertisement and just being like N/A. I don't relate to that at all."
"Murph: Right, Yeah."
"Brennan: It means nothing. It is nothing. Ricky, on an 18, if something were to appear in the mist, what would Ricky imagine would appear in the mist?"
"Zac: What would he imagine appear? I mean like, it definitely feels like something not good to him is out there. So remembering this sort of deep, whatever, I don't know, like probably a monster of some kind."
"Brennan: For a moment, you see a silhouette of Esther in the mist, and it's just a moment, a silhouette. And you hear in your ear, like you're wearing headphones almost in terms of it's very loud, but it's not pulse, it's not like telepathy or in your mind or whatever, you hear it but you know that no one else can hear it. You hear a click of like an answering machine or like clicking into your voicemail and you hear Esther's voice, but it's not Esther's voice. As it speaks to you in person, it's a recording, like a voicemail would be, and you hear Esther's voice say,"
"Esther: Hey Ricky, it's Esther, we need to talk."
Brennan: And it ends.
Ricky: [stares for a long time] Oh no.
"Cody: So I'm getting a sense of kind of just general nothingness, did you pick up anything?"
"Ricky: [shakes his head] I did not pick up anything,"
[Brennan laughs]
Ricky: Sort of also a general nothingness.
"Cody: So maybe like something is like, just like swallowing all the stuff, or like..."
Ricky: Yeah.
"Cody: It's just like a fucked up thing, it's just like, interesting."
Ricky: It feels like maybe we're maybe not the two best people out to guess what this is.
"Cody: No dude, we can fucking figure this out. Like, let's think about this, okay. So there's like good like normally we'd be able to know if there was good stuff or bad stuff, but this is just nothing stuff."
Ricky: Yeah.
"Cody: And the nothing stuff is just like getting all over. And so, but the, okay, lemme ask my devil, Hey, I'll translate for you, and I'll just kinda say out loud what the devil is saying."
"Murph: Hey, what is my devil's name again?"
"Brennan: Bazathrax, yeah."
"Cody: Bazathrax. Dark Lord Bazathrax, are you getting a reading from any of this shit?"
"Bazathrax: Ah, dude, I get, what's going on out there? I'm stuck in your chest, can you open your shirt?"
"Murph: Yes, I pop like this. [mimes pulling open his shirt]"
(laughs)
"Cody: This was specifically requested, I'm not just showing my tattoo to the mist."
"Brennan: You see, he goes,"
Ricky: Okay.
"Bazathrax: Oh dude look at that. What's out there is gray, but it's like bright and gray at the same time, that's crazy, yeah?"
"Cody: Yeah, so are like the devil's pissed about this too. Is this like, just like when you said there were renegades before, are you saying that there's like people that are on like monsters that are on another side? That are just like—"
"Bazathrax: Oh dude, no renegades is like people that either got out, left, or were kicked out of hell. Like some devils are too much assholes and and Lucifer don't wanna keep them around no more. And so he's like, “get the fuck outta here!” And then they're in earth, they're just on earth."
[Murph laughs]
Cody: Okay.
"Bazathrax: Anyway, anyway dude—"
Ricky: What’d he say?
Cody: Just devils everywhere.
"Bazathrax: Anyway dude, I sent those fucking invites out to the renegades like you asked me to, so there's a bunch, like New York, there's like a bunch like, there's imps, and there's lesser devils, but I kinda, I still see a bunch of people, dude. So it's all gonna be good."
"Cody: Okay, so my devil, I told you guys a bunch of stuff before, but I forgot some shit. My devil's super quick acting, just like a really good, quick assistant, kind of CC'd bunch of devils. So there are devils coming, but they're minor devils and they were fired. Most of them are fucking fired. They're not even in hell anymore."
"Ricky: Cody, what are you talking about?"
"Cody: There's, okay, so my devil, so there's other renegades that got into earth, right? 'Cause they got like kicked out of hell,"
Ricky: Can you start swinging the sword around?
[group laughs]
"Cody: Yeah, [swings it] so they are like around. There's other renegades which is like, honestly, if you think about it, pretty freaking badass, but there's like other imps and stuff that are going to, my devil manager said that they would do my bidding. But my devil manager also at one point said he was Lucifer. So.."
Ricky: Your devil manager assistant Lucifer.
"Cody: It's super confusing because apparently, he got fired from hell. He's not even like Lucifer, they're not even on good terms. So there are devils coming, but I don't… because this mist is the bad guy. I think that, that's fine."
Ricky: Maybe we should head back.
Cody: If you had asked me.
Ricky: I think we should head back.
Cody: [nodding] Cool.
"Brennan: [laughs] You guys head out of there. Ana and Amelia come and join up. And they meet up with you guys on the balcony again, after Sofia and Iga have their tea, they say,"
"Twins: This castle is awesome, like this is so fucking cool. It's the only castle we've seen is like Belvedere Castle or like, it's like this place fucking rules."
"Iga: Oh yeah, now this is a real ass castle. This is the real deal castle- wise."
"Twins: So we basically looked and we were, basically what we were looking for, was like, is there any infection here, is there something going on? We did detect traces of Umbral Arcana here. And honestly, like not even necessarily Umbral Arcana kind of like raw Umbra, just sort of here in the castle. We don't have like permissions from the wards of this place to go and dispel that ourselves, Madam Anastasia, you could grant us that, but also maybe this is something that you just wanna handle yourself."
"Brennan: You see they sort of whisper to each other and they just go like,"
"Twins: [quietly] Okay, yeah."
"Brennan: And they say also like,"
Twins: Do you super know what the source of the power in this place is?
"Iga: Yes, it is the spirits."
"Twins: Okay, yeah, for sure! Awesome!"
"Iga: The spirits of the castle, they give us the power."
Brennan: You see—
Iga: Sometimes leave a little bowl of milk out for them.
"Sofia: Oh, okay, a bowl of milk—"
"Iga: You know, they like the treasure, it seems like,"
"Brennan: Ah, you see Ana and Amelia both nod—"
"Iga: We don't hang out, I don't know what to tell you. We're not hanging out."
"Murph: Speaking of the treasure. I look at Ricky and Sofia and then I look at Madam Anastasia and I go,"
"Cody: There was this sword and it just seems like a pretty dumb sword, so, it was just kind of—"
"Sofia: Okay, that's not how you ask something. This place is full of family heirlooms, so don't call any of them dumb. Show some respect, young man."
"Cody: Madam Anastasia, can I have this sword?"
Iga: The umbrella sword?
[Emily laughs]
"Zac: It was a regular sword in an umbrella holder, right?"
"Brennan: Yes it was a regular sword in an umbrella holder,"
"Cody: It's just a regular ass sword, but it's cool."
Sofia: Say something nice about the sword.
Cody: It's a cool sword. [quietly] Fuck.
Siobhan: Can I do an Arcana check on the sword to see if it actually does anything. 'Cause if it's just a shitty ass sword he can have it.
"Brennan: Go ahead, yeah, go ahead and make the check. Go ahead and make a—"
"Siobhan: Yeah, that's a 25 Arcana."
[Emily laughs]
[mystical music]
"Brennan: This is a.. you call it the umbrella sword. There are legends attached to the sword of it being forged for a knight, who was a tyrannical knight in medieval Poland, who basically got it made, hated it, and like tossed it aside and got his other knights, like burned down the village where the sword was crafted and a peasant boy found it, picked it up. It's sometimes also called the peasant’s sword. And basically took it and trained with it until he was like a master swordsman, went and killed the knight who burned his village down, who had requisitioned the sword to be made. It works best in the hands of the humble is the only thing you know about it."
"Iga: You know, actually I think the sword will suit you. [laughs]"
Cody: Sweet.
"Iga: But you do owe me a favor, just to be clear. This is a pretty big, it was a nice, good—"
Cody: Super appreciate it.
"Sofia: [quietly] Cody. Cody. Pay her, pay her."
"Iga: Yeah, you know, stay humble, Cody."
Cody: I don't have money.
Emily: Can I look at the sword and see if I think it would be a better fit with Ricky?
"Brennan: With no rolling necessary, a million percent would be a better fit for Ricky."
Cody: It kind of hurts when I touch it. Fuck.
"Emily: Can I try to look at, can I try to make eye contact with Ricky kind of be like,"
"Sofia: All right. Ricky, by the way I just wanna say like, thank you so much for giving the questing blade to my deceased husband so that he could visit me sometimes—"
"Ricky: Oh, yeah, of course."
"Sofia: I just, I've noticed your holster empty ever since."
"Ricky: Yeah, well, I mean to put it in… so you know Cody."
Cody is swinging the sword.
Ricky: Can you stop swinging it? Can you stop—
"Cody: Yeah, what's up?"
"Ricky: I used to have a pretty cool weapon and then I gave it up when it felt like I should. And now I'm not using a weapon until it feels like I should use, like until that weapon finds me, you know."
Cody: Cool.
"Iga: I mean, maybe you try the sword."
Cody: Do you want—
Iga: You should try it.
Ricky: I'm okay.
"Brennan: Bazathrax goes,"
"Bazathrax: Dude, under no circumstances, give this fucking sick ass sword up there under no fucking circumstances."
"Cody: [doing figure-eights with the sword] Feels right, dude. exactly the same as this other sword."
[group laughs]
Brennan: Incredible. You guys exit from Iga's otherworldly dimension.
Sofia: Thank you so much for a lovely stay Anastasia that really was very nice.
"Iga: Thank you, no it's nice to have guests, even under these unfortunate circumstances."
"Brennan: As you exit, Kingston and Pete, you see Ana and Amelia as these guys come out of the chest Ana and Amelia walk over to Esther to report to her really quickly and basically go like,"
"Twins: We scanned the castle and everything, there's definitely raw Arcana in there, which is probably not great. Until Lowell identifies like the chest, we won't know all the wards that are keeping that dimension in there. I think, look like the only person who's gonna be able to really like explore that castle is gonna be Madam Anastasia. The castle is not the source of the magic. There's like something in there. Something like down deeper in the castle, I think."
"Brennan: And you see that Esther goes,"
"Esther: Ah. Well, maybe we have plenty to deal with as it is. And Madam Anastasia has made clear that her involvement in the city is limited to what she desires."
Brennan: I think Kingston and Pete give me Insight checks.
"Lou: Ah, Nat 20."
Ally: 20 but not Nat.
"Brennan: Whooo! Dirty 20 for Pete. You guys both call it Kingston you can see, absolutely. Esther, all of the things that are going on here, like Cody's devil stuff and Iga's box. You can see Esther in her head being like, okay, a kid found a random infernal book in a mall. This warlock who'd kind of like, doesn't give a shit about the rest of the Unsleeping City. Like has a problem with her family heirloom. You can tell that Esther has been like, these are symptoms. The disease is the stuff the Voxes and Sofia are worried about. And you can see her kind of in her head also because she, you can see that she has just like a wizardly disdain for warlock magic and people that like don't have deep curiosity about that kind of shit you can both tell that she possibly like too quickly writes Iga and Cody off as like, these are clearly dominoes that are falling based on a larger, more primary domino. She goes,"
"Esther: Okay, well, we have Lowell trying to get Iga on the books. I think that we can let her have her privacy until such time as Lowell becomes available, there's plenty for us to do."
"Brennan: And you see that she motions over to you Sofia. She's like,"
Esther: There's plenty for us to be doing in the meantime.
"Ally: I think I clock this kind of like cold scientific attitude and really try to make up for it by getting to know the two of them more or just being like,"
"Pete: Hey, thanks so much for swinging by. And I really would love a reading from you Iga."
"Iga: Look, you guys have been very nice. I'll give you all a little card, one card each."
Pete: Yes please.
Iga: But this is not—
"Sofia: I wouldn't mind a card, honestly."
"Iga: Here we go, if you want it is a card. Thank you and payment in kind for kindness to me today, okay? So Sofia, tell me when to cut."
There’s a beat where they just stare at each other.
Iga: You gotta say it fast—
Sofia: Cut.
"Iga: 'Cause I'm running out of the cards. Oh my goodness, the Ten of Pentacles, money and wealth."
Sofia: Wow.
Iga: Will come to you soon. And maybe two little dogs. Maybe the nice time—
"Sofia: Okay, I'm more of a cat person, okay."
"Iga: That's understandable, they're nice looking dogs. Pete, if you like to tell me when to cut."
Pete: Cut.
"Iga: Oh, the Nine of Cups. You're a man and you're sitting here with your nice cups. You're having a nice time at a celebration with your cups is a thing you like to do, your drinking and your cups?"
"Pete: Yeah, there are probably too many cups around me at all times."
Iga: Yes. But see maybe you're ignoring the cups you having a nice time ignoring the cups that are behind you because you don't need them anymore.
"Pete: Wow, that's really deep. I want a full reading from you please, I'll come by."
Ally: I like write down your address.
"Iga: Any time, any time."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, so you guys healed up in Kingston's hospital room, successful from the subway battle. Cody, you've reverted to your correct age. We're gonna move right now because there's so much arcane research and stuff to do. And you guys have a lot of questions unanswered. We're gonna move into a period of downtime, which is also just because ""The Unsleeping City"" takes place at a place where you guys all have jobs and families and work and shit. Your adventures do have to get squeezed into the schedule from time to time. You guys have a little while before Lowell can take a look at Iga's chest. During this period of downtime, we will probably run some scenes here, but also it's totally fine if we narrate our way through it, let's start off over the period of the next like week to two weeks."
(upbeat music)
"Brennan: Over through the next weeks, two weeks before, while you guys are waiting for Lowell to sort of examine this chest. There's a lot of stuff that comes up about Sofia and the monastery, Pete had those ideas about Nod and Metropolitan Museum of dreams. There's a lot of investigating, Esther in the Gramercy Occult Society. So everybody go ahead and think of what you're... like a primary and a secondary activity during downtime. And also, for Pete and Sofia in particular, I'll need to know your downtime activities specifically as well. Does anyone have an idea of the main thing that I'll be looking over the next week or two and the big stuff you that you have on the plate in front of you to handle?"
"Emily: The other is one piece of housekeeping I have to do, which is like, I just need to talk to some of the people at the monastery, or we don't have to run it as a scene. I just need to get the A-OK, 'cause I know that they have a different relationship."
"Brennan: I think we absolutely should run this as a scene. So the following day Sofia goes home from Halloween, you walk into your bedroom and you see wrapped up on your bed, a silver gleaming pair of nunchucks on the bed."
"[soft, somber instrumental music]"
"Emily: (sighs) Okay, I go look at them."
"Brennan: You see, there is a note left on them that says,"
"Dale: I'm not any good at lying, and I know that you've probably caught wise to what I want to do. But I would never do anything without talking to you. These don't belong to me, and I've been using them, to come and see you when the world and other people might use them for something that they need them more for. I'm sad all the time because I'm hanging on to you so hard, and I feel like me doing that is keeping you from finding something in your real life. But I wouldn't just say goodbye to you in a note either. Come to Greenwood Cemetery if you wanna talk with me, and talk about why I feel this way, but I can't keep doing what I've been doing because as happy as it makes me, I know it's hurting you."
"Emily: I don't know if I should go to Greenwood Cemetery right now, but I also, if he asks for it then yeah, I'll go to Greenwood Cemetery."
"[map whooshing, zooms in on Greenwood]"
"Brennan: You go to Greenwood. You're there at two o'clock in the morning. It's like Halloween night still. You've had the fight earlier in the night. And you arrive at Dale's grave that you first visited with Jackson three years ago, and you see, shimmering over it is Dale. Who's already just fully weeping."
"Sofia: [on the verge of crying] I guess, I just want to say that if you were doing this to try to make me feel better, I would never let you do it. The only reason I would let you do it is because, I mean, you're in heaven right now! And you deserve to enjoy heaven as much as you think I deserve to enjoy where I am. You deserve to enjoy heaven, I mean, I can only imagine what it's like up there. I mean, so I really wanna fight you on this, but I think that, I think that what you think you're giving me, I need to give you, but I guess I wanna ask one thing. If I ever found magic that could bring you back, would you, I just feel like, I feel like the world really lost something when they lost you. And I feel like the world lost something when they lost us. So if I found any of that magic would, could I use it on you?"
"Brennan: Dale thinks for a moment, and he… You look at your husband and you can see him wrestling with this."
Sofia: You don't have to answer today 'cause I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
"Brennan: He looks at you and says,"
"Dale: Sweetheart, it's a really bitter lesson. When you realized how much hope hurts. The idea of you bringing me back is something I've thought about every single day. I got taken away from you, senselessly, stupidly. I got close to some bad people and they got the jump on me. And that was it. The only thing that kept me sane was knowing that you were gonna find them and you were going to make it right, because there's nothing in this world that you can't do. If you find a way to bring me back…"
"Brennan: And you see something snaps in him and he goes,"
"Dale: I didn't beat the shit out of angels over the course of three years to stop you from trying to bring me back,"
Sofia: [smiling through tears] Okay.
Dale: But you got to promise me something.
Sofia: Uh huh.
Dale: That you won't let the hope of that drive you crazy.
"Sofia: I know, I know and I know that there is something I'm supposed to learn by us not seeing each other in a way that is unnatural. And I will figure out what I need to figure out without you. But I swear to God, if I get my hands on something that can bring you back, I'm probably gonna use it, unless you tell me explicitly not to."
"Dale: The things that are possible in this wild fucking world, sweetie, they're endless and natural, unnatural. I love you in life and from beyond always and forever. And I wouldn't have… I just realized in the forest the other day near the deer that just, I could tell how much you were counting days."
"Sofia: I know, but I could also tell it on you."
There’s a long silence.
"Dale: Live life, be happy. I— I know we're each trying to give the other person the same gift. We've always done the same thing. We've always tried to be the person lifting the other person up. I understand that. Only difference is this, is that, where I am there's no rush. And there's nothing on the line. Let me be the one to count days because there's nothing on this side that's demanding my attention, other than how much I love you."
"Sofia: I know. [sniffs] I won't, let my, I won't let, you know. I won't let it compromise my judgment, I know that. What I feel for you doesn't come first in this world, but it for sure fucking comes second."
"Brennan: [giggles] He smiles, he embraces you. He says,"
"Dale: I like that. After all, what comes after is where I'll be waiting. And this should come first because what's second is always gonna be there."
Brennan: He kiss—
Sofia: [whispering] Okay.
"Brennan: He kisses a tear off of your cheek and smiles and looks… He has the same look that you know is on your face of wanting this so desperately and knowing that as good as it is for the other person, it's also hurting them, in a way that he can't bear anymore. And he smiles and fades into light."
[chiming]
"Emily: Okay, I think that was actually good for Sofia though, because she wanted to know if she could hypothetically someday bring him back. [Brennan laughs] Not that she, I know that the lesson is not that she's supposed to focus on that, but there is an ease to know that if she found an option that he wouldn’t be mad at her."
"Brennan: Hey Sofia's— (mumbles) Hey, Dale will be wrestling with it. And so will Sofia because hope hurts. But it's hard to let go of if you think it might be out there."
"Emily: And then I look at these cool nunchucks, and I say,"
"Sofia: Wow, I bet these do something pretty fucking cool."
Emily: And then I just put them in my pocket.
[both laugh]
"Brennan: You put 'em back there. Cool, awesome, awesome. The next day you head over to the Monastery of the Midnight Sun. You climb the fire escape outside of Spaghetti's Bakery, head up into the monastery. You see the monastery again is made out of all sidewalk, pavement blocks, the walls are sidewalk, the ceiling's a sidewalk. And as such people can walk on any dimension sort of the MC Escher style, like everything is floor basically. You see out in the yard there's a group of monks doing training, like calling out forms and poses. You see that there are… you walk into another room, that has those like spinning wooden blocks, where like you strike them and they spin around they strike you from the back. But there's a dude running with a full pizza through it. Like,"
Brennan mimics balancing a pizza over his head.
"Brennan: [martial arts grunting] You see, training that guy running through with the pizza is the head instructor of the monastery. Solomon who waves over at you and goes"
"Solomon: [deeper voice] Morning Sofia, how are you doing today?"
"Sofia: Morning Solomon, I'm good, how are you?"
"Solomon: Good, good, oh Cindy wanted to talk to you for a moment, by the way."
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah, I'll go find her. How are the recruits looking, strong, fresh, agile?"
"Solomon: This one sucks, but yeah, the other ones are good, for sure."
"Brennan: You see the guy with the pizza just full face plants and Solomon goes,"
Solomon: Boo! Boo to that.
[Emily laughing]
"Brennan: You walk along the hallway coming out of, one of the live, the sort of scroll libraries. And again, unlike the sort of Occult Society, your scroll, a lot of your things are just like long unfolded scrolls that have, in addition to writing, like a lot of pictorial stuff, like anatomy guides, pictures of poses, the libraries of the Monastery are all practical. There's not a lot of waxing poetic here. A lot of it is like, here's what we learned works. Here's how to defend yourself. Here are the inner practices and spiritual guidelines to keep yourself safe in like realms beyond. And you see that Nadia walks out, goes like,"
Nadia: Hey Sofia! Good to see you back. How you doing?
"Sofia: Hey Nadia. I'm okay, how are you doing?"
Nadia: Good! You've been on patrol for a minute. Good to see you back in the monastery.
"Sofia: Yeah, I started to miss the books, so I had to come back and check and make sure they were still here."
"Brennan: Yeah, she's like,"
Nadia: I'm gonna go see Cindy right now too. Did you hear what happened?
"Sofia: No, what happened?"
"Nadia: Well, an old First Fist of the order who left a while ago, back in like the late '80's to go start a monastery in San Francisco, he just got back."
"Brennan: And you see, he walks in and she says,"
"Nadia: Yeah, something fucked up happened. Like a monastery got destroyed out in San Francisco."
"Brennan: You walk into this giant chamber lit by like golden candlelight everywhere. You see that there are a couple of other monks meditating in here, Cindy Wong, who is the abbess of the Monastery, who's basically in charge of the school, the libraries, the relics and everything like that. Looks up to you Sofia, as you enter as the current First Fist of the monastery, she smiles… She is a very like plump, wonderful, smiling, middle-aged Chinese American woman who has like tons of like light floral imprints and like floral slippers, a true beam of sunshine next to this, not tall, but like about honestly about the same height as you broad shouldered, thick muscles, tattooed, older looking monk who you see, she gets up and says,"
"Cindy: [smooth, calm voice] Come right this way. Sofia, this is Jackson's predecessor. This is Tony Simos."
"Brennan: And you see, this guy looks up older eyes. You see like, honestly, yeah, like mid late, like mid to late 50's, but kinda like, New York, like older Greek guy, like so Staten Island kind of like clearly has been to like the Jersey Shore or like Long Island so much that he is just like baked into leather. His tattoos are all like faded into his body. Thick old man biceps, you just see a muscular old man. And you're like, oh, wow, like, oh dude. [Emily laughs] Shaved head, thick like sort of peppery salt, more salt than pepper beard. He gets up, he's got tears in his eyes and he gets up and goes."
"Tony: [Staten Island accent] Huh, [wipes his eyes] holy shit. A pleasure and an honor, Miss Lee, I met Dale once coming back home. I'm sorry for your loss, I have, (sniffs) sorry you caught me fuckin' emotional out here. Fuckin' being back in this place is a trip,"
Sofia: Yeah.
Tony: Pleasure and an honor and...
Sofia: It's a pleasure and an honor to meet you. What happened in San Francisco?
Brennan: He sighs and Cindy sort of rubs his back as he goes.
"[soft, sad piano music]"
"Tony: It's fucked up war of attrition, kind of over the past, like 15 years, we just lost a lot of fucking monks in the monastery. And a lot of young kids, there weren't as many like kids from the neighborhood around anymore. Like we fuckin'... I went out there to start the Order of the Iron Heart. We had our monastery, we were overlooking the Bay. You could see the bridge, beautiful. Basically, by the end there was only about, about a dozen of us left. People had moved, people stopped coming. We weren't finding as many worthy candidates. And one night we got attacked by these... I don't know, they were like shadows or something. And… Monastery cracked in half, I could've kept fighting, they didn't have me down, but the stone just crumbled and something magical, and the monastery gave out and they were gone."
Brennan: He looks at you… give me an Insight check.
"Emily: Ah, 15."
[soft instrumental music]
"Brennan: You can tell that he's doing the best he can to tell you what happened. But there's definitely a simultaneous thing of, like all like machismo, it is deep shame. And there's a ton of him talking about this, is hurting him to talk about."
"Sofia: Oh, well, hey, you know what? It's happening everywhere, that kind of stuff."
"Brennan: You see, he nods and says,"
Tony: Yeah.
"Sofia: Yeah, that's not on any monastery shoulders. I bet you all were doing a great job. But there's some shit going down, which is actually why I was hoping to speak with Cindy a little bit, but I mean, you as well, of course."
"Brennan: You see, he looks and says,"
"Tony: Yeah, by all means, go for it yeah."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Tony: And honestly, I'm just honored to be... Just sort of don't have a home right now, but..."
"Sofia: You do now, especially if you were once here, you’re actually coming home."
(laughs)
"Brennan: You see, he sees, he smiles and says,"
"Tony: Oh, look at that, a little hospitality, nice to see a Staten Island girl by the way."
"Brennan: He says, (laughs)"
"Tony: I know you're Sofia Lee, but I knew your old man, back in neighborhood we grew up together, not sure what your relationship is to your family, but."
Sofia: My relationship is that I live with my mother and I don't see any of the rest of them.
"Brennan: He's like,"
"Tony: Good, 'cause I tell you what. Your father, Bicicleta, he was a fucking punk then and I bet he's a fucking punk now so..."
"Sofia: He's still a fucking punk, yeah. I guess I wanna make sure, Cindy I've, I think I've taken some liberties and I need your A-OK to continue in a direction that I should have consulted you about."
"Brennan: She says,"
"Cindy: By all means, Sofia what's what's going on, what do you need consulting with?"
"Sofia: I kinda started reading some stuff at the library about some stuff deeper, about deep dreaming and how like it's, how there's all these other monsters out there. I know that in the past, the order's been little more adversarial with the dreaming world, but I kind of maybe told Pete a couple things. Pete's the Vox Phantasma."
Brennan: Go ahead and give me like a Persuasion check here.
Emily: Okay. 12.
"Brennan: Nadia… Uh, and go ahead and give me an Insight check."
Emily: Dirty 20.
"Brennan: Cool. Nadia has enough like friendship with you and respect for you that she looks like, Nadia looks like she doesn't even know why that would be weird. Cindy knows why it would be weird that you didn't mention it before, but doesn't seem averse to it. Like she—"
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: She looks like, has a look sort of like, “oh, that's unfortunate that you didn't tell us first, but I don't disagree with your judgment”."
"Sofia: Okay, it wasn't premeditated. It kinda came up because some stuff is maybe happening with a dream world. So it came up organically, I didn't plan."
Brennan: You see Tony looks at you and goes.
"Tony: Shit, we got a Vox Phantasma in the city right now?"
Sofia: We got a Vox Populi and a Vox Phantasma.
"Tony: Holy shit,"
Sofia: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see, he looks over at Cindy and shrugs his shoulders and says,"
"Tony: That spells fucking trouble, huh?"
"Brennan: He says, he points to you and says,"
Tony: Mrs. Lee—
Sofia: Trouble?
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Tony: Yeah, you got your work cut out for your kid. I got your back, if you need anything. Vox Phantasma in the city has always precipitated huge incursions from the dream realm. Talking about monsters, beasts, vermians, paragons, shit like that, I mean fucking bad news. If there's a Vox Phantasma, do we know where this person is?"
"Sofia: No, I'm friends with the Vox Phantasma. He's a great kid."
"Tony: Oh, okay."
"Sofia: He's a really good kid, we had a huge incursion from the dream world and he (finger snaps) made it go away. I'm, from where I'm standing having a Vox Phantasma, Vox Populi at the same time, it's like, wow this is a rare opportunity."
"Brennan: And he looks over and says,"
"Tony: [unconvincingly] Huh, okay, well, yeah, okay."
"Brennan: You see, Cindy goes,"
"Cindy: All right, well I understand that—"
"Sofia: I'm sorry, what'd you say your name once again?"
"Brennan: He says,"
Tony: Oh sorry--
"Sofia: Sorry, I just wanna, sorry."
"Tony: Tony, Tony Simos."
"Sofia: Tony, right, okay. Yeah, yeah, cool yeah."
"Brennan: You see that Cindy goes,"
"Cindy: Well all right, listen, have you talked to Miss Sinclair about it?"
"Sofia: Yeah, I have, yeah, yeah We talked about in, I guess I wanna to initiate sort of pooling some resources with Gramercy and other folks."
"Brennan: You see that she looks and says,"
"Cindy: You are First Fist of the Monastery, if you believe that this is going to keep the monastery safe, this is within your purview. As our lead warrior."
"Brennan: You see that she says,"
"Cindy: If Miss Sinclair sees some benefit to pooling resources in this way, and this feels like a way to address some issues."
"Brennan: She says,"
"Cindy: We haven't seen you in a few days, I take it that there's some dreamworld activity that is pressing or of concern."
Emily: Can I do an Insight check on if I should say what's going on in front of Tony?
Brennan: Give me an Insight check.
"Emily: 17 plus one 18. Wait, oh wait, think I have plus three to insight. Yeah plus three, dirty 20."
"Brennan: Dirty 20. You're, Tony looks to your extent rattled right now, I think on a dirty 20 it's up to Sofia, there's an awkward situation here. Tony used to be First Fist of the Monastery and left to go start his own order. That position does not revert back to him, but he used to have Sofia's job in the order."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: And there is a degree of, (laughs) I don't know, it's up to, I will let Sofia, I'm gonna give you, I don't wanna tell you what you see on Tony with a dirty 20."
Emily: I know.
Brennan: But there's a spectrum that runs from the shallow end of this guy is old school and rattled all the way to worse stuff than that.
"Sofia: Okay, yeah, Cindy, we got into a scuffle. There's actually so much to talk about that I'm gonna have to catch up with you later about it. 'Cause I'm meeting up with Esther, but actually one thing I would say is we got a kid who is obsessed with the mall and he made a deal with a minor devil. So I think we're gonna focus on that. That's our big problem right now."
[Brennan laughs]
"Sofia: Yeah, so yeah."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Go ahead and give me Deception.
"Emily: (breathes heavily) Okay, 10."
"Brennan: Cool. You don't see anything from Tony. You see Cindy goes,"
"Cindy: All right, well."
"Brennan: And she says,"
"Cindy: Nadia, if you could go and help Sofia with whatever you deem would be necessary to share."
"Brennan: You see, she looks and says,"
"Cindy: Would you, maybe it would be safer or better for, the wizards of the Gramercy Occult Society to come here."
"Sofia: They're certainly welcome, yeah. I think it's wherever they feel most comfortable getting into their sort of wizardly concentration. But I'd love, I would love to like, show them some of the bestiaries I was looking at."
"Brennan: You see she goes,"
"Cindy: Very well, absolutely, Sofia."
"Brennan: Sofia, you walk away from there. Tony follows you for a moment and he says,"
"Tony: Hey Sofie, I just wanted to say, I heard all about Alejandro's passing, incredible guy."
Sofia: Yeah.
Tony: And I also heard about what went down New Year's Eve three years ago.
Sofia: [quietly] Yeah.
"Tony: Great work, I just wanted to say, I know that that Dale was looking out for, that Dale was sort of our chosen one and, congratulations, seriously. The order is lucky to have you."
"Sofia: Well, thank you very much. I only hope to serve it as well as Dale would have. I'm really looking forward to working together. It's great to have another super powerful person here."
"Brennan: Yeah, he smiles and says,"
"Tony: Hey, I'm glad that the rumors precede me, all right. Hey and if you need a hand, I'm happy to offer one."
Sofia: Absolutely.
"Brennan: Awesome! Downtime, okay, great."
[Emily and Brennan both laugh]
"Brennan: Cool, cool, cool. What are people's downtime activities that you guys are waiting for Lowell to kind of get back around to the chest?"
"Siobhan: I do think that Iga is going through the castle, in what downtime she has..."
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: To like, make sure that everything is, just to sort of do an inventory of like, what's here, what's not like, what can I notice that's changed?"
[gentle strings fade in]
"Brennan: Awesome, go ahead, there will be plenty of these downtime periods. So these are not gonna be make or break rolls because there will be many of these opportunities, but I'm gonna go ahead and just sort of set our DCs here at 20, across the board. Go ahead and give me an Arcana check for this first period of downtime."
"Siobhan: Great. ...Mm, that's an 18, I'm gonna use a luck point to re-roll that"
Brennan: Go for it.
Siobhan: That is a 25.
"Brennan: Hell yes, Iga, you notice as your journey on the castle, you have never explored the castle all the way down before, because a lot of the inherited wisdom of your mothers and grandmothers going back is there are places in the castle that—"
Siobhan: Avoid the darkness.
"Brennan: Avoid the darkness in the castle, stay in near places with windows that can see the sky. Right?"
Siobhan: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: You... stuff continues to fade within the castle. It's not happening rapidly, but those portraits fade a little bit, some of the color saps out of things and closer, around like the week mark or so, you get into a bit of a fight with Jessica. And you see that Jess… you're supposed to have a lesson 'cause she is getting older to kind of talk about some of this stuff more. And she kind of voices like, hey, I'm like, not interested in that. And it becomes a little bit aggressive. And you just notice that she, in the course of the argument, talking about the stuff that she's learning, she forgot the name of this old Polish fairy tale you used to tell her as a kid, and it just hurts your feelings I think, maybe in like an unexpected way that she's like forgotten something that was a very beloved memory of yours from her childhood. She heads off to go hang out with friends in the city you, the next time you're in the castle, there are books about the character from that fairy tale that are gone from the library and those spaces on the shelf are just empty."
"Siobhan: Hm no, this is not good. It's very bad, okay. Can I maybe call up Kingston and be like,"
"Iga: If we can move things along with your guy with the butt, I would appreciate it things seem to be rapidly..."
"Kingston: Yeah, of course, it's good to hear from you when yeah. I'm texting Lowell every day. As soon as he's ready, we'll get things going."
"Iga: Thank you and if he needs some help moving things along,"
[Brennan laughs]
Kingston: Okay.
"Iga: Not with, just financially, not with the butt stuff."
Kingston: Oh not with the butt. No he's he has lubricants and things that are medical grade.
"Iga: Yeah no, just but like— financial bump to bump the chest up the list—"
"Kingston: It's encouragement, I understand. You got it, Iga."
"Brennan: Yeah, and Iga, I think that seeing those books missing Iga's point about New York and how much it changes and how that's okay. I think reverberates back to her, seeing this family heirloom lose those fairytale books from this amazing, magical castle."
Siobhan: Like maybe she was okay with the city changing because this was always gonna be the same.
"Brennan: Yeah, I think so. Other people doing downtime stuff."
"Zac: I feel like Ricky would, although Pete is watching over Cody, would like want to also be an influence in Cody's life with regards to like paladin stuff."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: Just to like, he's new to it."
"Brennan: Yeah, so Ricky's kinda hanging out, giving Cody a hand. Cody, I think this is gonna give Cody advantage on whatever downtime activity you're taking."
"Murph: Sweet. I think Cody is trying to, because Cody's not trying to be evil, he's trying to harness the darkness."
Brennan: Yeah.
[Emily laughs]
Zac: He thinks he’s spying.
"Murph: Yes exactly. So Cody, I think is trying to find out the nature of this devil book and these like renegades that are coming and to see like, if... Cody is trying to see how bad he fucked up or if he can actually do this."
"Brennan: Awesome, give me… you can either choose Religion if you are trying to study or Investigate If you are going to like locations trying to find shit out."
Murph: Hmm I think I'll do Religion is better for me.
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
Murph: That's a dirty 20.
Brennan: That is the DC for these downtime activities.
Ally: Hell yeah.
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah. What kind of questions are you looking for?
"Murph: So I think first off, I'm asking Bazarath—"
Cody: Who did you CC?
"Brennan: He's just mentioning, he's like,"
"Bazathrax: Zargariel, Lanothrax, Zargobon, Grazel, Grazel, Grazel. Um, fuckin’,"
"Cody: Okay cool, and they are under, are they under you, or where do they stand?"
"Bazathrax: Oh dude, well, yeah, they, I mean, some of them might've been, but a lot of them from different departments, the fucking, I mean the main thing, dude, it's like, we're all renegades now, but don't worry. All these people chill. And I was basically like, I was like, only chill people. Night Angel is a chill champion of darkness. I called you Night Angel, I didn't call, 'cause no one knows your name's Cody, dude."
"Cody: Very cool, very cool. Ambassador of the Dark Lord is cool too."
"Bazathrax: Yeah, I didn't put that, but I did a bunch. I did a big CC and I was basically like, come in, New York is a fucking free for all. We're gonna get rolling, we're gonna get it in style. we're gonna get wet. Let’s fuckin’--"
"Cody: All right. No, alright. Just shut the fuck up, okay?"
Emily: Get wet? [laughs]
"Cody: We need to figure this out. We're not gonna, we're going to send a reply all."
Bazathrax: Okay.
Cody: Okay. Listen to me.
"Bazathrax: Yeah. Okay, reply all."
"Cody: We're gonna send a reply all. We're gonna say, We're not just fucking everything up. We have particular things that we're gonna fuck up. You need to come talk to the Night Angel, the Ambassador of the Dark Lord. Let's get this shit buttoned up, Jackass movie style."
"Bazathrax: Dude, I fucking love Jackass—"
"Cody: So funny, so fucking funny."
Bazathrax: So fuckin’ funny.
"Brennan: We actually have to come back to this scene in a moment. So we're gonna handle, (laughs) we're gonna 'cause there's something that it's very good you rolled that 20. Holy shit."
[gentle jazz music]
"Lou: I am, I think with all the talk of places and spaces and things going away, I think Kingston is thinking about the electronics store. So I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna bake a dozen muffins, package them up, in little like, little twosomes. And then I'm gonna, I would like to go on like a long walk around the neighborhood, delivering muffins to friends, but then also looking at properties that have been bought or like real estate development, that's happening in my area. And if there is a recurring theme or a name that's coming up a lot on possible properties that are being bought up much like the electronic store."
"Brennan: Incredible, go ahead and give me either, this is either Investigation, if you are really looking— Oh yeah, go for it. Yeah what'd you get?"
"Lou: Oh no, is there another option?"
"Brennan: I say Investigation is the first one, but you also, if downtown, if it's really about people, I would let you do Insight as well."
"Lou: I mean, well, let's go to the people. [laughs] Especially 'cause my Investigation is only plus two. Insight, we're going big 29."
Ally and Emily: Ooh!
Brennan: Holy shit.
Zac: That's a big 29.
Ally: That's a big 29.
"Lou: A big 29! Wall to wall 29. Yeah, I think as to just what's getting bought up, Who's buying, who are people selling to? If there's just, if there's a recurring name or a group."
Brennan: Hell yes.
[soft jazz continues]
"Lou: And then of course, the muffins are also an essential part of this, this is not just, this also just a good time to see people."
"Brennan: Hell yes, you go around the neighborhood, 29. Yeah man, on a 29, a lot of people in the neighborhood have been approached. I'm gonna say on a 29, you find out there is a company called Excelsior Dynamic Homes. That people got hit up, Reggie gets back to you too. And it's like, yeah, that's the company that came for that store there. And you get a meeting on the books, with a guy because there's a building that is going up. It's not right on 125th, it's a little bit buried. It's like a smaller five. There's like a five or six story apartment building. But it has a nice view kind of, oh, you can kind of see 125th Street from it. And a young enterprising real estate agent agrees to show you some homes who work for, who works for this company who agrees to show you some apartments. Cool, cool."
"Lou: Yeah, great."
"Brennan: He meets you downstairs, this is like luxury. It's like a, they've renovated like a luxury condor space. He goes like,"
"Devin: Oh! Mr. Brown, pleasure to meet you. I'm Devin, hi, hello, hello."
"Kingston: Okay, nice to meet you, Devin."
"Devin: Great, well, why don't you come on up and we'll show you some of the units."
Kingston: Great.
"Brennan: He begins to go around,"
"Devin: So, central air in all of these obviously lot of great stuff available. You can see all the way around"
Brennan: And you see these like—
"Kingston: Yeah, it's just…"
"Lou: Oh, go ahead."
"Brennan: Expansive apartments. The price listings here are insane, man."
"Kingston: Hey Devin, so, I'm of course. Thank you so much for showing me around. In terms of this kind of… you work with Excelsior Dynamic. You guys do, you guys, are there other properties that might be able to check out in the area that you guys are working on?"
"Devin: Yes, we have a couple of other buildings. This is one of our oldest. This is the one that we're really trying to move."
"Brennan: He says,"
Devin: We only actually have two units left in the building.
Kingston: Oh really?
Devin: Yes.
"Brennan: Kingston, as he says that you've been walking down this hallway, all the doors are open. All of the apartments are just empty. So you've walked past like eight apartments that like the doors are open, there's no furniture in them. There's just like, there's some like, cleaning equipment and stuff like, that to keep places clean. But here he says,"
"Devin: Yeah, we only have two units left in the building."
"Kingston: [laughs a little] Is that, it just seems like they're not many people actually living here."
"Brennan: He looks at you and sort of smiles and goes like,"
"Devin: (chuckles) Of course, yeah, I mean, most of our—"
Kingston: Of course what?
"Brennan: He's like,"
"Devin: Well, I mean the units, these units are extremely appreciable assets. So, most of the people that own these units, are don't live here."
Kingston: So a bunch of people are buying up property in this neighborhood and just choosing actively to not be here?
"Devin: Well it's well, yeah I mean, these are obviously one could choose to live in an apartment they owned, but these are assets are only going to appreciate in time, the price of these going up and up and up. And you this is a I mean, honestly, this is a better investment than bonds, I mean. [laughs]"
"Lou: Kingston's blood is boiling,"
[group laughs]
"Lou: It's just going to, rather than fight with Devin, just be like,"
Kingston: Devin. That is one way to see the world. It is not one that I—
(group laughs)
"Kingston: It is not a lens through which I choose to view. Thank you so much for your time. I have your card, I might give you a call. This place is great and it's worth living in. And I don't get why these people are having such a hard time seeing it. Good day."
Lou: And I head out.
"Brennan: You head out and walk past the corner where you see an old bodega on the corner, and you just noticed that it looks a little dusty and it's still open, still there."
"Lou: I move, I hustle to it and just order a bacon, egg, and cheese, and just sit out in front of it."
"Brennan: You see the guy happily makes it for you and smiles and says,"
[gentle jazz music]
"Bodega Owner: Hey, thank you so much. First sandwich I sold today."
"Brennan: And you realize it's like middle of the afternoon. And all the people that would be on this block, walking past this Bodega aren't here."
Brennan: [claps] That is Kingston's downtime activity.
Lou: Kingston is crushed.
[Emily laughs sadly]
"Brennan: Pete, downtime activity from you real quick."
"Ally: I would, so I obviously would love to talk to Nod or go to the Museum of Memories, but I think honestly just what the memories that I have of Josefina are so like depressing in that way, kind of when you like realize they're like patterns in your family that you also have, and you're just kind of feeling kinda doomed. So instead I'm gonna go to an NA meeting. [chuckles]"
"[brighter, slightly more exuberant jazz]"
"Brennan: Hell, yes. Yeah. you, there is arcane stuff to do, but you finally have a stable living situation for the first time in a while. You take—"
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: You take two week to get moved in, get your stuff. You meet Lugash, out on the street one morning, he goes,"
"Lugash: Oh, Peter, it is so good to see you, my friend."
"Brennan: And your sponsor, Dr. Lugash, walks you to your great meeting. And it's pretty easy you grab the R, sorry not the R, you grab either like, something on the yellow line that takes you down. And then you grab the G train going into Greenpoint to your old Greenpoint meeting spot. Dr. Lugash is there and you spend two weeks really focusing on yourself. Your sobriety die moves up to a d6."
Ally: Sweet.
Brennan: You are doing better than you were a little while ago.
[group claps]
"Brennan: Way to go, Pete. Hell yeah."
"Ally: Hey, thank you."
[group chattering]
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Now I've got a little bit of cushion. Barely.
[group laughs]
"Brennan: You know, Pete—"
Murph: No chance of rolling a 1 on a d6.
Ally: Yeah.
Murph: No chance at all.
Ally: No chance!
Brennan: No chance.
Ally: None.
"Brennan: But again, rolling a one on d6 now, wouldn't mean Pete relapses—"
"Murph: Oh right, yeah."
"Brennan: It would just mean that he moves to a d4, so there is, even with that, there is cushion. Pete's doing way better. Sofia, downtime activities from you here."
"Emily: Oh yeah, I think just doing the research, helping out with the Gramercy Occult Society. I definitely want to like shoot off some loving texts to, honestly, everyone could probably use a loving text. But yeah I wanna stay in touch with like Madam Anastasia and yeah, just, I think just like going through these bestiaries trying to take the practical stuff that's in the monastery and then some of more of the theoretical stuff in Gramercy Occult Society, and then seeing where they overlap."
"Brennan: Copy that, okay, go ahead, and I'm gonna say too so that list of stuff that you're doing there, you're going ham, keeping in track of people and helping with Arcana and stuff like that."
"Emily: Yeah, and then maybe I mean, I'm also kind of keeping an eye on Tony."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: Like if, anything else weird comes up with him, I think I'm gonna try to give them the benefit of the doubt if he's ever around I wanna, remember, tell a story of like Pete saving the day or stuff like that."
[upbeat jazz music]
"Brennan: Incredible yes, absolutely. I'm gonna go ahead and say roll your Arcana, roll either Arcana or Investigation here."
"Emily: Okay, they're both plus one. (laughs) That's an 8."
(laughs)
"Brennan: Eight, cool. But you do, you are sharing a ton of resources with the Gramercy Occult Society. So Esther, I'm actually gonna say, if you want instead of rolling yourself, you can give Esther a help action on—"
Emily: I will do that.
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah. [laughs] Awesome, Esther gets started looking into it. And basically it goes like arrives at something where she's like,"
"Esther: Okay, I think we have enough that as soon as Pete is free and able to get back into things, we have a lot to go on, to get started. These are incredible resources, Sofia."
"Brennan: You also meet a new person that Esther has inducted into the Gramercy Occult Society. There's a new wizard in the Gramercy Occult Society that you meet Sofia named JJ. JJ is this person that she was talking about back in episode one, who was like the Columbia math whiz guy. You see he's wearing, he is a big dude, he's got a little 1up, like, video game t-shirt. And is sort of amazed… He's like just been inducted into the Unsleeping City. He's like,"
"JJ: Hey, I'm JJ, super nice to meet you. This is all wild, this is crazy."
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's really cool, right?"
"JJ: Yeah, thank you for all these research materials. Holy shit magic is super fucking real!"
Brennan: He's like—
Sofia: You like video games?
JJ: Yes I actually—
Sofia: I have a new friend who really likes video games. He talks about them a lot.
"JJ: Oh, I can't tell if that's good or bad, but that's— [finger guns]"
"Emily: What are the video games that you keep referencing, Murph?"
Murph: Soul Calibur and Final Fantasy.
Sofia: He loves Soul Calibur and Final Fantasy. I'm not sure which one.
"JJ: Hell yeah, awesome. I'm here to keep an eye on this stuff."
"Brennan: You see Esther smiles and says,"
"Esther: JJ is, has done a lot of research specifically into physics surrounding time and so we're really excited."
"Brennan: He's like,"
"JJ: Yeah, I kinda discovered this theoretical particle of time. If that makes sense. And Esther was like, hey, that's, you've discovered magic through science. So you're kind of a wizard, so wooo."
(chuckles)
Sofia: Tell me more.
"Brennan: You see, he's like,"
"JJ: So basically it seems like New York has an interesting relationship to time. We know that time and space are interrelated, right? That sort of relativity and everything like that. But,"
"Brennan: He goes on and starts rattling off to you. Also Sofia, because you were going ham in his two week period, your sobriety die is going to go down to a d12."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah, you're just, you're you're going ham. [laughs] Awesome. As JJ is talking, Cody, we're gonna come back to your scene real quick, you see Bazathrax goes,"
"Bazathrax: Okay, so we're sending out the CC reply all great. [beat] Um… hey, we might kinda have a problem."
Cody: Why?
"Bazathrax: So, you know—"
Cody: We're all on the same side here. We all embrace the darkness. What is the problem?
"Bazathrax: So, you know how like, when you’re like doing a birthday party email and you're like, who do I invite—"
Cody: No.
[Brennan laughs]
"Cody: No, we don't do that."
[tense electronic music]
"Bazathrax: Hey, I'm sure I forgot somebody. So if there's anyone I left off, feel free to bring them along, right?"
"Cody: Did you not invite somebody who you should have invited, or did you invite like some asshole devil?"
"Bazathrax: So I kinda wanted to keep it New York specific, but it looks nice to people outside of New York, kinda maybe found out and heard there was gonna be a party and they're kinda on their way. They're fuckin' extremely powerful, dude. They're extremely powerful. And they're not from the fucking city."
"Cody: So are they, what there're… [whispers] Fuck! But they're on our side, right?"
"Bazathrax: Oh dude I kinda don't know, I kinda don't know. This guy is kind of a big deal. He just kinda—"
Cody: Who?
"Bazathrax: He kind of found out that I was, I've invited everybody to a rager."
Cody: [hands on his head in exasperation] Fuck.
"Brennan: These people don't like, treat places that they go to on the weekend super well. Ah shit dude. This is really super bad."
Cody: Are they from New Jersey?
"Bazathrax: Yeah, dude, it's the Jersey devil."
[Emily laughs]
Murph covers his face while Ally flips Brennan off.
Bazathrax: I'm super fucking sorry dude. I super fucked up dude. He's on his way dude! He's got all his buddies from A.C.—
Cody: Fuck!
Bazathrax: And the shore.
Cody: You fucked up!
"Bazathrax: They're on their fuckin’ way, dude—"
Cody: You fucked up dude!
"Bazathrax: Dude, I just got a message back—"
Cody: I said to reply all! You said they would be cool!
"Bazathrax: They’re comin’ to the Holland Tunnel, dude! They’re goin’ to the Holland Tunnel, dude!"
Cody: We are supposed to be on the same fuckin' side man. Fuck!
"Murph: Uh, Ricky— [laughs]"
"Brennan: Sofia you are with Esther and JJ right now. And you see in the Occult Society, [beeping] these alarms start going off."
"Brennan: Esther goes,"
Emily: What the hell is that?
"Brennan: JJ starts looking around he goes,"
"JJ: Okay, did someone forget to plug something in or something?"
"Brennan: You look around and begin to see this alarm going off. Esther goes,"
Esther: That's the city's defenses. That's the edge of the Umbral Arcana.
"Brennan: Cody and Ricky, what are you guys doing as this is happening?"
Murph: I'm just scrambling to tell—
"Zac: Wait, I’m sorry, where am I?"
(laughs)
"Brennan: You're with Cody at this present moment. And I'm actually gonna say that Sofia, you see those alarms going off, Cody and Rick, you guys look out— It is night-time outside. [music stops] By the Hudson River, you see New Jersey and storm clouds gathering on the other side of the Holland Tunnel, as you begin to hear, (beatboxing) and a voice bellowing from the clouds,"
"Voice: Let’s get fucked up, dudes!"
"Brennan: (laughs) And that's all for this episode of ""The Unsleeping City."""
"Emily: This is so funny, Murph summoned New Jersey!"
[group laughs]
"Lou: Well done, Murph."
[Brennan claps]
Lou: Well done.

"Brennan: Hello one and all! And welcome to another exciting episode of Dimension 20 The Unsleeping City: Season Two! I'm your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan, and with me as always are our intrepid heroes! Say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Oh boy, oh boy. Gang, it's the middle of November, a crisp New York City evening here in the Unsleeping City as [deeper voice] thunder rumbles in the distance and a threat arrives from the far western shores of the Hudson River. For indeed, the patron devil of our knight of darkness Cody Walsh, AKA the Night Angel, Bazathrax, bound by Pete the Vox Phantasma into a sick-ass chest piece that says ‘Redemption.’ Bazathrax reached out thinking that his dark master — or dark employee I guess is the better, the better term? — would dig a bunch of devils running around and causing chaos in New York City. And even though Cody got on it right away, apparently those RSVPs got a little too far afield and the Jersey Devil discovered that it was open season on the island of Manhattan and they are on their way. Oh no. Numerous other things are also in the works that have been discussed. Last time we ended, Kingston was hot on the tail of some horrifying real estate shenanigans going on in the Waking World. While Sofia and Esther were covering their tracks from the other side of things, looking into the nature of Nod. Iga Lisowski was exploring the mythic castle within the ancient chest, kept in her bedroom in Greenpoint. While Ricky was keeping an eye on the new kid, Cody, to make sure he didn't get up to too much trouble. Looks like it didn't quite work out that way."
Emily and Brennan laugh.
"Zac: Didn't work, didn't work at all."
"Murph: Well, we’ve reeled it in a little bit because the devils have always been, have been coming since I said it was fine at the hospital. So if anything—"
Zac: True.
"Brennan: That's right, we had a little bit of down time. And Pete used the two weeks of down time to get settled in Astoria and take care of himself, which we love to see."
Ally: I go on runs now. It's a really nice temperature. Nice evening runs.
"Emily: [laughs] Oh, Pete you should get a bike."
Ally: [gasps] You're right.
Brennan: Oh! Get a nice bike and bike around!
"Ally: I mean, it needs to be an only okay bike. I don't want it to get stolen."
Emily: Yeah.
Ally: I like to have a shitty looking bike that works amazing. That's the dream bike.
Emily: Yeah.
[dreamlike music]
"Brennan: So yes. You, we also met some new cadets of the Gramercy Occult Society. We met JJ, short for Joe Jacobs, who is a new apprentice wizard at the Gramercy Occult Society. We also met a returning member of the Order of the Concrete Fist, Tony Simos, a former First Fist of the Order and dealt with the aftermath of the appearance of raw Umbra itself in the Waking World. All of that covering our bases. [thunder noise] Lightning sort of crackles. And in the middle of their conversation you see Sofia. You're at the New York Public Library talking with Esther. You see JJ is making polite conversation as you guys have a snack, just going like, you know,"
"JJ: Oh, man. Yeah, it was great. Well, no, I got the full ride to Columbia, which was crazy and um—"
Sofia: Wow.
"JJ: I’m the— Yeah so, my both of my brothers are back on the rez, I'm here living in New York, sort of studying math. And now I get—"
"Brennan: [blaring alarm noises] The alarms go off, Esther leaps into action, yells out and goes,"
"Esther: Oh god, oh god, oh god."
"Brennan: Ana and Amelia, both teleport here in a blast of sort of bats and smoke. [bat chittering]"
"Emily: [laughs] Very cool, Cody would have loved that."
"Brennan: Esther rushes over to a series of books, [whooshing noise] sweeps across it as runes leap off of them to show an illuminated map of Manhattan. Red dots blinking, much like the highway hex map in the Clinton Hill Chantry, show many approaching figures coming from New Jersey. Towards the Holland Tunnel."
Emily: Okay. Bottleneck the Holland Tunnel.
"Brennan: Esther looks around and goes,"
"Esther: Oh god, oh god."
"Brennan: And you see that there is an image showing the strength of the Umbral Engine, and it's flashing. Go ahead and make an Arcana check for me, Sofia. Call it a DC15 Arcana."
Emily: I got a 9.
"Brennan: 9, you, it looks like it's flashing, Esther cocks her head looking super confused, she goes,"
Esther: We're at 150% capacity on the Umbral Engine.
"Brennan: And you see that the flashing is not a like red, of like a low battery. But actually this like bright green going into gold, of like the Umbral Engine looking over, like over-juiced. She goes,"
"Esther: Okay, um."
"Brennan: She looks at you, Sofia and says,"
Esther: There are wards at the Holland Tunnel and the major bridges to stop other thing— How the hell did they get here? This doesn't make any sense. How are there devils in Jersey City?
Emily: Do I have any insight that this is Cody?
Murph laughs silently.
Brennan: I think immediately Sofia knows that it's Cody.
"Sofia: Yeah I think I know who's responsible for this. I don't really want to, I don't really want to call them out though."
"Brennan: [laughs] You see Esther steps back for a second, calms herself and goes,"
Esther: Okay. The Umbral Engine is overloaded. [incredulous] I don't understand this!
"Brennan: You see, she turns to you, Sofia and says,"
"Esther: The Umbral Arcana only extends through the five boroughs of New York. Without any Umbral Arcana, devils shouldn't be able to openly travel through Jersey City. I don't know how they got there. This is, this is crazy that this is happening. The membrane that makes magic— the Unsleeping City— has to do with the sleep deficit of New Yorkers. So I don't understand how or why devils are openly out. There should be wards!"
"Brennan: She zooms in on the Jersey entrance of the Holland Tunnel and puts a hand over her mouth. And she's like,"
Esther: The wards are all down. Um.
"Brennan: She looks at the other wizards here, says,"
"Esther: Okay, way too— I have to stay here to fix the Umbral Engine with what's going on. Um, I know how to do it."
"Brennan: She goes,"
"Esther: Ana and Amelia, can you guys go to the wards on the tunnel?"
"Brennan: You see Ana and Amelia both sort of put hands over their mouth and they say,"
"Twins: I'm so sorry. We're vampires, we can't go into the Hudson River. It's running water."
"Brennan: And she goes,"
"Esther: Shit. Okay, okay, JJ,"
"Brennan: She points at JJ. He goes,"
"JJ: [panicked] I'm very new, I'm very, very new."
"Sofia: [hurriedly] Me and everyone else can do it, we got it. We got it."
"Brennan: She looks at you, does the quick math in her head that Ana and Amelia can't go into the water. She casts Water Breathing on herself. She says, she goes,"
Esther: I'm going to head into the river to fix the actual runes along the tunnel. You've got to hold them off.
"Brennan: She looks at, she says,"
Esther: Ana and Amelia—
Sofia: Jersey side?
Esther: Jersey side.
"Brennan: You see, she looks and says, she says,"
"Esther: Ana and Amelia, you're going to have to tackle the Umbral Engine yourselves, JJ doesn't know—"
"Brennan: She looks at JJ and says,"
"Esther: [slowly, more calmly] JJ, this is a crash course. I'm very, very sorry. You're in extremely good hands. You're going to go. There's going to be a sequence of runes on the Jersey side of the Holland Tunnel. Sofia and her friends are going to take very good care of you."
Brennan: She looks at Sofia—
"Emily: [laughing] Oh no, JJ. Your freaking life is in our hands. [laughing] Okay!"
"Sofia: Okay, JJ, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make sure you get back to Columbia to go to Intro to Physics or whatever."
"JJ: [panicked, sputtering] Okay! Um, what is exactly? It’s just, it’s what exactly?"
"Brennan: You see Esther goes,"
"Esther: [quickly] Minor Abjuration, you'll be fine. It's just Shield spells. And we went over those already. You're just powering up the Shield spells. I'm going to tap you into the mainline cause I'll be underwater on the tunnel. Sofia, we got to hustle."
"Emily: All right I shoot out a text to everyone. and I say,"
"Sofia: Meet me on the New York side of the Holland Tunnel so that we can all go through together. Or if you can get straight to the Jersey side, just do that."
"Brennan: Kingston and Iga, you guys are in an apartment up in Washington Heights right now with one Lowell Masters, who's finally gotten the time. You see you're in there. You see he looks around. It's nighttime now. It's pretty late, it's a Friday night, but he goes,"
"Lowell: Thanks so much for stopping by. I'm glad that you all could, could come by. Kingston, great to see you. How are you doing, how's Liz?"
"Kingston: She's great. You know, busy with work right now, the big old Rico case but hey, part of the job. Anastasia, this is Lowell."
"Iga: [nods] Hi, Lowell."
"Kingston: Lowell's an archeologist, a scavenger in the positive sense, just a all around good guy."
"Brennan: You see Lowell looks over to you. His house is very filled with wonderful objects, but also immaculate. There are like a lot of aroma candles lighted. There's some like incense, air purifier, as like lived in as it feels, it feels very clean in here."
"Zac shakes his head slowly, Emily laughs."
"Brennan: He, he walks over to you and says,"
"Lowell: Madam Anastasia, it's a pleasure to meet you, my name is Lowell."
"Brennan: You see, he specifically looks like by practice he doesn't go for a handshake but just sort of nods his head. And he goes,"
Lowell: So I understand that Kingston has kind of explained the deal to you a little bit. I assume people talk and you know.
"Iga: Yes, no, I understand the deal and I have made my peace with it."
"Lowell: Yeah. I just want you to know that obviously, you know there's a certain level of absurdity here to how I'm able to perform this magic. No one cares about these artifacts more than me. We're going to take all the proper protections. Nothing lasting is going to happen to your artifact. There's not going to be, you know, I just, you know. I've, I've worked with hundreds and hundreds of artifacts and the process is as streamlined and [makes air quotes] lubricated, if you'll forgive the pun, as it could be."
"Iga: [makes hesitant sound, holds up a hand to motion him to stop talking] Okay, I can make it very small. So it goes—"
Lowell: Great.
Iga: —so it will be very easy for you.
"Lowell: Without, without alarming you, I will say size actually is not a factor."
Ally and Emily laugh.
"Iga: No, that, that, that there's actually no way for you to say that that does not alarm me."
"Kingston: Yeah, Lowell we can just, we can skip, you know. We can skip that part."
"Lowell: All right I know, I just didn't know, look because of people like Kingston in my life I've developed a sense of comfort with what it is that I do and what it is that brings me joy. And again, my love for these artifacts is very academic as well. And I have a lot of love for the people that choose to bring them in. So I understand. I'm just trying to ease a process that for some people can be—"
"Iga : So like 24 hours, 48 hours?"
"Lowell: It depends on how complex the identification is. We will know the major broad strokes within the first 24 hours. If it's a deeper Identify, might go 48. However, your arcane contact with it should not be limited or harmed in any way while I'm casting the spell. There— truly, the process involves zero Abjuration. There won't be any walls or wards up, it's pure divinatory magic, I’ll be happy—"
Iga: Just skin to box.
"Lowell: Yes, yes. [laughs, sighs out] Well—"
Iga: Well!
Kingston: Let's begin!
Brennan: You guys both get texts on your phone from Sofia.
"Kingston: Oh, uh. Uh, I need to go handle this. Anastasia, you, we would of course love to have you. If you'd like to come."
"Iga: Look, I, the people coming in from Jersey I will come and take them out. I, we don’t need those Jersey people--"
Kingston: That's something we can all get onboard with.
"Iga: Bridge and tunnel, no thank you, you know?"
"Kingston: Great, are you okay leaving the box here with Lowell, for him to do his business?"
"Iga: Sure. I'm sort of psychically connected to the box. I kind of know what's happening. Unfortunately, I kind of will know what is happening with it."
"Brennan: Lowell steeples his fingers and nods knowingly, just."
Lowell: Mhm. Mhm.
"Iga: But it does mean, I know if you do any shenanigans with it, I will know. I will know where it is at all times a little bit too intimately, but I will know."
"Lowell: Sure. It's going to be a, you know, it'll be moving around over the next 48 hours just sort of throughout the neighborhood."
Iga makes a disapproving noise.
Iga: Okay.
"Lowell: Just, you know, as I go about my business, but--"
"Brennan: You see that he puts a little plastic tag on it with the number 71. Hands you the other half of the tag, rips it off so that you have sort of like a dry cleaning, like this is your tag for the item."
Siobhan: I wipe it a little bit on my sleeve before I put it in my pocket.
"Brennan: He looks at it, he's like,"
"Lowell: It's fine, I’m—"
"Brennan: He says, again,"
Lowell: Everything here is incredibly sanitary. You'll have your item back in a moment. Is this the size that we're going to be working with here?
Lou laughs.
"Iga: No, I can shrink it down a lot smaller."
"Brennan: He goes, well, he says,"
"Lowell: [impressed] This, this might be, this might be a 12 hour job in that case. So yeah, no worries. All right."
"Brennan: So [laughs] you shrink the box down as small as you can, hand it to him. And he says,"
"Lowell: All right,"
"Brennan: He says,"
"Lowell: I'll be taking extremely good care of this, Madam Anastasia."
"Iga: [to Kingston] I guess it's nice the man has found his passion. I mean, who knows what other tricks people might have if they just stuck things up their butt."
"Kingston: Exactly. You know, Lowell is a pioneer."
"Iga: Maybe all kinds of people could be casting spells. They don't even know about it because they don't want to do butt stuff, I don't know."
"Kingston: I don't know either. Either way, we should probably get out of here. We've got some fucking Jersey trash to fucking sweep back over the river."
The cast laughs.
"Brennan: Incredible. Pete, you grabbed that text as well. I assume Pete's probably just like either out in Astoria or like grabbing dinner with Lugash, or something like that."
"Ally: Yeah, exactly. Yeah I'll head over there right away."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Cody and Ricky.
"Cody: Fuck, dude, do you think we're going to get in trouble?"
"Ricky: Um, you know—"
Cody: Do you think people are gonna be fucking pissed at us?
"Ricky: [carefully] Cody, I feel as though I let you down today and although you know, definitely not a good thing that this happened, we just both will impress upon the rest of the crew that we have learned from this mistake. And it'll be good going forward. Yeah, it'll be fine."
"Cody: Cool, it's fucking airtight, dude. We should just get there and try to like handle this before they even get there. And then we don't even have to tell on ourselves if we don't want to."
"Ricky: Uh, yeah."
Brennan: The texts show up on both of your guys' phones.
Cody: Fuck.
"Ricky: Okay, everybody knows."
"Cody: Yeah, let's go. They don't know who did it though. So if it doesn't come up, we don't have to lie."
"Ricky: Yeah, I wonder who could it be. Who could have done it? Who could have possibly done this? [breaking slightly to laugh]"
Cast laughs.
"Cody: We gotta go, dude."
"Murph: Cody's Find Steed, Cody's Find Steed is a shitty moped [laughs] and he sprints over to a moped, and it has literal warhorse stats. So it has one horsepower. So he takes his one horsepower moped and just fucking tears off."
Cast laughs. Lou shakes his head sadly.
Zac: I ride up with Ox.
"Siobhan: So slow, you might as well walk."
Cody: Fuck!
Siobhan: Your knees are around your ears.
"Brennan: Incredible. Yeah, Ricky, Ricky and Ox are literally just keeping up side by side with you. Truly incredible."
"Ricky: Hey Cody, look. [mimes running, then doing Naruto arms]"
"Zac: And I do the Naruto arms and like,"
"Ricky: I just started watching it. And it, you know, just to—"
Cody: Holy shit.
Ricky: To understand your references.
Cody: Dude. How far did you get?
"Ricky: Uh, I got two episodes in."
Cody: Nice. First episode's a tear-jerker right?
"Ricky: Yeah, pretty sad stuff. Not for sure understanding the references that you mentioned yet, but we'll get there."
Emily laughs.
"Brennan: You guys take off and meet at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel. On the New York side of the Holland Tunnel. All of you guys, all you guys meet up."
"Emily: I introduce everyone to JJ and I say,"
"Sofia: This nice young grad student is going to be doing something that they're perhaps out of their depth doing. And so we got to look out for them, I believe."
"JJ: So that's basically what Esther told me. Hi, I'm JJ, by the way, you can call me JJ. Joe's also good, but both. But I was, I sort of found out sort of right after Halloween that magic was real. Esther said it's basically like a minor Shield, I just have to power up the runes over on that side while she's, she's under the Hudson River right now rigging up the tunnel for the spell to come through. Because normally there are wards that keep these kind of renegade devils, like, like magical creatures in other parts of the world can't just travel here on foot either because there are actual external sort of waking world wards up. But those wards are, are down and we're not we're not even really super sure why but they should be waiting for us there another side and we're going to get them back up. What, what are we fighting? ‘Cause I don't actually, I've actually never for real been in a fight before."
Ally: I'm so distracted because all I'm thinking about is how I could have sold him Xanax. [laughs]
"Pete: Wow, that would have been a huge sale."
(laughs)
"Ricky: JJ, there's nothing to worry about. I think we're going to be fighting some devils. Nothing scary about that."
Cody: Yeah. This was sort of a—
"Iga: But I don't think you're going to be fighting devils. You don't have to worry about fighting, you're not fighting today."
JJ: Okay! Let me know if I should. I don't have any spells that hurt people but I will punch someone? I don't know.
"Iga: No, no, no."
Sofia: I think focus on what Esther tasked you with. And the rest of us will do the punching or whatever our version of that is.
"Brennan: Incredible. Sofia, you look at Ricky ahead of you. Who's standing here once again totally unarmed and feel the weight of the Questing Blade in your back pocket."
"Emily: Oh, that's what he gave me?"
[dramatic music]
Brennan: Oh the silver nunchucks that Dale gave you are the Questing Blade. He returned it to you.
Emily: Oh!
Brennan: Because that was the way he was getting out of heaven over and over again.
"Emily: I didn't know that, okay."
Sofia: Ricky? Hey Ricky.
"Ricky: Hey, what's up?"
"Sofia: Hey, before. Hey, so sorry. I know it was like really, really important and stuff like that. Dale sent you a little present,"
Emily: And I give him the nunchucks.
"Brennan: Sofia, as you produce the nunchucks they float above your hand. Wreathed in light, right in front of Ricky, the nunchucks move. The Questing Blade has always taken the shape of its wielder. It became a fireman's ax in Ricky's hand, the Questing Blade booms out over the New York entrance of the Holland Tunnel or rather the exit of the Holland Tunnel. And it goes,"
Questing Blade: Whosoever be most worthy of the Questing Blade shall wield the power of a true champion.
Brennan: It erupts into a twisted and barbed double handed great sword and shoots into Cody's hands.
Emily: [nearly shrieking] Cody's hands?
[Murph laughs hysterically. Siobhan disappears offscreen]
Cody: Yes!
Sofia: What?
Cody: Yes!
Sofia: What?
Cody: Yes!
Cody swings the Questing Blade around.
"Cody: Fuck this other sword, dude! [throws it down]"
"Ally: Wait, how many swords does Cody have right now?"
"Brennan: Cody, as you swing this sword, it full on makes like distorted heavy metal lightsaber sounds as you swing it, like. [imitates lightsaber sounds in a gravelly hum]"
Murph: Cody's just making his own sounds.
"Cody: [punctuated by sword swings] This is fucking awesome, this fucking rules."
"Sofia: Ricky, I'm so sorry, I thought that was for you. I'm so sorry, Dale doesn't even know Cody it makes no sense."
"Cody: Ricky, do you want my, I so I was actually going to use, I have a replica sword of Frostmourne from Warcraft 3 that I was going to use that I got at BlizzCon that I bought off a cosplayer. So I was gonna use that, or I have that other umbrella sword, if you want. ‘Cause like this one kind of chose me."
"Ricky: Yeah, no, I know."
"Cody: Just like, do you need—"
Ricky: Cody?
Cody: Uh-huh.
"Ricky: First off, I'm so happy for you. I’m so happy for you."
"[cast laughing uproariously, which continues throughout Ricky’s speech]"
"Ricky: I'm so happy that the Quest, the Questing Blade found you. And I'm glad that you have it. And, and I'm just wanting to be clear about that because that's true, and that's how I feel."
Cody: I feel like—
"Ricky: And then also, sure, I'll take that umbrella sword. I'll just hold on to that. You know, I would be lying if I said I thought this was how it was going to go down."
[cast laughs]
"Ricky: Give me that, give me that little guy and we'll get started."
"Murph: I hand the Peasant’s Sword to, to Ricky."
Zac: It's called the Peasant's Sword?
Murph: Isn't that what it's called?
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Cody: I actually, I renamed it. I was going to call it Frostmourne but then I realized that I had an actual Frostmourne, so I just like kept it in my backpack."
"Ricky: Great. Well, thank you so much for this and you know a cool thing about that, that sword that you have is you can also talk to that and it'll talk back, just to throw that out there."
Cody: Really?
Ricky: Yeah it has a voice and has—
"Cody: [still swinging the sword] It's like a real life Frostmourne. That's fucking awesome, dude."
"Ricky: I don't know what that is. But yeah I think it sounds like that. I know you just told me, but I'm, I'm feeling a lot of things firing in my brain at the same time. I would love it if you, you know maybe we could stop swinging it so much right here it's much larger than the last sword you had."
Cody: I just feel like the sword likes whatever I'm doing.
Ricky: [rubbing his temple] It probably does. It probably does.
[cast laughs]
Cody: Cool cool.
"Sofia: Oh, this is so painful."
Ricky: I'm going to go over here and stretch for a little bit.
"Cody: Sofia, thank you so fucking much. This is like the coolest, like I bought swords on Etsy. I've tried to make my own swords but like my parents wouldn't let me like mess with like fire and shit. So I couldn't do like blacksmithing stuff. And then I tried to take a real class but then I just, like, I got fucking bored. So I just started like buying them and stuff. And like, this is the first time I got one for fucking, for free, except the other time I got the umbrella sword, but this one's—"
"Sofia: And that’s what you love about it, that it was free. And that, it, okay."
Iga: You're welcome!
"Sofia: First off, you’re welcome."
"Cody: No, the umbrella sword's fucking awesome, thank you."
"Sofia: Yeah, absolutely."
Cody: I said thank you.
Sofia: Whoa. Okay.
Ally: We're all just awkwardly quiet.
Lou: Yeah.
"Sofia: Cody, just know this, you know, it's a really special, very impossibly special weapon that has meant something very powerful to a lot of people. And I hope that it brings out the best in you."
[Brennan laughs]
"Cody: This is the coolest sword I've had since my Buster sword was confiscated, unless I can get another Buster sword which, that thing was custom made on Etsy. That took me a fuckin’ like eight months to get so."
Zac has his hands over his face.
Pete: So that would outrank this sword you think?
Cody: It depends.
Zac: I think Ricky just shatters a statue next to him. [crashing]
[cast laughing]
"Emily: I was going to say, Sofia watches this, this little piece of shit wielding the weapon that her husband used to come find her and she just goes and punches a wall."
"Ricky: Sorry, I was stretching and I had to, dynamic stretching."
Brennan: I think—
"Pete: Ricky, are you okay?"
Ricky: Yeah I'm fine. I’m cool. I had a coffee.
"Pete: Okay, so should we go stop these devils, guys?"
"Kingston: Yeah, we’re good?"
"Emily: Before we go in, can I cast my once a day Freedom of Movement?"
Brennan: You absolutely—
Emily: Oh I'll cast Jump as well.
Zac: Are we like seconds away from a battle? Do we know that?
"Brennan: Yeah, you're like seconds away from a battle right now."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: You guys I think, yeah. It's very easy to see Sofia punching a wall like through frustration is one thing, like Ricky, I don't know if, I don't think, like, for Kingston and Pete and the people that know Ricky, I don't think you guys have ever seen anything like this."
Zac is staring intensely into the camera.
Lou: Can we make an Insight check on Ricky?
"Brennan: Yes, give me an Insight check."
Murph: Can I make an Insight check? I have a minus two but.
"Brennan: Yeah go ahead Cody, give me an insight check."
Murph: ‘Cause I realized like everyone's not super pumped for me which is like a little weird to me.
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure."
Lou: I got a 28 insight on Ricky.
Murph: I got a 4.
"Brennan: Cody, this sword is so fucking sick. Zac, what is, what is Kingston seeing when he looks at Ricky?"
Zac: You're seeing the first real challenge Ricky has ever faced.
[whole cast laughs]
"Cody continues to swing the cool lightsaber sword, oblivious to Ricky’s internal pain."
"Zac: This is, obviously there are ups and downs in his life. Mostly ups. This is the, and not that, he doesn't know what to do right now. And he is surprised by his own, he's very much trying to put the work in with Cody but he is feeling challenged."
[Brennan and Emily laughing]
"Lou: I think Kingston comes up alongside Ricky and like doesn't like get in his space but it's just like,"
"Kingston: Hey, let's get through this. And then let's grab a cup of coffee, just talk."
"Ricky: Yeah yeah. I mean, I would love, I'd love to have a coffee."
"Ally: I pass by and I'm like,"
"Pete: That guy was made in a lab to get under your skin, Ricky. We all see you and let's get through this."
Ricky: He's a great guy. He is a great guy.
"Pete: Oh that's a hard T, you're really enunciating."
"Emily: I pop in and I say,"
"Sofia: Ricky, he's a little piece of shit and he doesn't deserve your sword."
Brennan: Meanwhile—
Zac: Ricky fully locks up.
Brennan: You guys make it to the other side of the Holland Tunnel with JJ.
"Lou: Are we just like walking through cars? Like, is that what's the vibe inside the Holland Tunnel?"
"Brennan: I would say the vibe inside of the Holland Tunnel right now is you guys walking along the sort of catwalk, there's sort of tiled railing walk on the side."
Lou: Got it.
"Brennan: Umbral Arcana is sort of protecting you as you guys emerge from the tunnel on the other side, and you're hoofing it, you see Jersey. Kingston, you can tell due to the laws of the Port Authority as long as you don't exit this strip of road or go past the toll booths you will still be within the bounds of New York City but you feel this is the, you are close to the borders of your city right now. Like you can see the toll booths where the Port Authority ends. And even now you're not, you're also in New Jersey. You're just in a liminal space. You're standing on the threshold where New York and New Jersey intermingle. And it's an intense feeling. JJ looks out, Pete, as you look out you see, covering Jersey City and roiling towards the south along the coast of New Jersey, you can see... actually Sofia and Pete give me Perception or Arcana checks."
"Ally: Yeah, that's a 23."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: Nat 20!
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Sofia, you immediately solve the riddle of how the devils got here. You're both seeing, it's in the nighttime sky so it's almost impossible to notice. There is a raw throbbing vein miles across stretching south of raw Umbra. Like Umbral Ar— raw Umbra is pulsating and connecting New York City down to the south with like the, probably the Pine Barrens where you know the Jersey Devil actually like, dwells and lives. There are other pockets of magic all throughout the world but there are kind of these dead zones of no magic, it's not always easy for them to get to each other. But you see like pulsating Umbra connecting and forming basically like a land bridge as you hear in the distance rumbling thunder and [beatboxing]."
[bass-heavy electronic music fades in]
Ally: Is this anything like we've ever seen before this like vein?
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: No, this is fucking weird man. This is like dream shit getting pushed out here. But I think for Pete with that high Arcana check, so Sofia on that nat 20 you also can tell so many devils are coming. There are hundreds and hundreds of devils approaching."
Emily: But they are all going to have to take the Holland Tunnel. They can't swim across?
[mysterious music]
"Brennan: Correct, they are not gonna be able to swim the Hudson. They have to take the Holland Tunnel. You also see that through that vein you, on a nat 20 Perception, feel something. And you see up on a billboard, there's like a billboard that has like an anti-smoking message on it. And it has a sort of like blue background. There's a gray silhouette of an individual wearing a suit on the billboard. And it doesn't make sense in the graphic design. It's human size, so it's like tiny. You couldn't see it from the road but you just see that there's like a patch of gray on this billboard in the, in the silhouette of a, just sort of short haired individual in a suit. Pete, you look out and see, raw Umbra is something you mostly don't deal with in Nod because Nod is so like vibrant and alive, like raw Umbra is just like, you know it's like fucking, the space between interesting things. It's, it's shadow, it's haze. It's like nothing, you know, like. And to see it like roiling out here means something is pushing this through from the other side. All of you hear [thunder crashing] as JJ looks at the wall and goes,"
"JJ: Um, there are supposed to be, there are supposed to be runes here. There are supposed to be runes."
"Brennan: And is casting some cantrips to try to illuminate them. You see that instead of a spellbook he's got all his spells loaded up on a laptop that goes to a like battery pocket in his back pocket. And he's like [magical energy whooshing] drawing runes from his screen and throwing them up onto the walls. And is going,"
"JJ: Um, I'm not, I'm not really like super seeing the runes up here. Um, I know what they're, what they're supposed to look like."
"Zac: I will cast Divine Sense? Is that the, to see if I can find anything? And I'm also gonna put Protection from Evil and Good on him if I can do both of those."
Brennan: Yeah.
Lou: I'd also like to cast Death Ward on JJ.
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: JJ looks around as you guys come over, put hands on his back and he goes,"
"JJ: Thanks that feels, that feels great. Yeah, I can do it."
"Brennan: He looks, and he goes,"
"JJ: Something's like, erased the runes."
"Murph: I whisper to myself,"
"Cody: Bazathrax, did you, did you fucking do this?"
"Bazathrax: Dude, you think I? No this shit, the shit that used to be here was anti Infernal, I couldn't fucking touch it."
"Brennan: You guys hear the approaching noise of music, screeching cars, people pulling donuts in gas stations. Like you see that JJ goes like,"
"JJ: The runes are just gone. They're just gone. Look, I know how to do this. I can do this the hard way. I can, I can reroute it."
"Brennan: And he goes into his computer. He's like,"
"JJ: I got it. I'm going to start now getting, getting something back up in place okay?"
"Kingston: Great, JJ."
Brennan: Cool you guys have those spells on JJ... JJ for the record is a first level wizard.
Siobhan laughs a little.
Zac: I'm also going to put Sanctuary on JJ. Because that's not concentration.
"Brennan: Cool so he's got Sanctuary, Death Ward, and Shield of Faith on him right now?"
"Zac: No Protection from Evil and Good, not—"
"Brennan: Oh Protection from Evil and Good, incredible."
"Emily: Can I clarify one thing? With my nat 20, that gray silhouette that I saw on a billboard, is it like in the picture or does it feel like a person is standing there?"
"[ominous, mysterious music]"
"Brennan: You have to walk a little bit to see if it's part of the billboard or a person standing there. You walk a little bit and the image, it doesn't click right. It's flat, but it's not moving like it's flat. It's hard to describe the physics of it. And as it does so you see the head of the figure turns for a moment to look at you and is gone."
Lou: Hoo hoo hoo. Oh no.
"Emily: I tell everyone, except for Cody, what I saw."
[Brennan laughs]
Emily: I'm just kidding.
Brennan: Everyone's Divine Sense goes off. Someone roll a 1D6 for me.
Siobhan: Ally?
Zac: I'm not in a good place to roll.
Murph: I got it. I got this. Guaranteed. 6. Is that good or bad?
Brennan: You guys have six rounds before whatever's coming gets here.
Murph: Great!
Lou: Fuck yes.
Emily: Yes! That’s awesome! [impressed] Cody!
Ally: Murph! Murph!
"Brennan: Because some of your durations are only like a minute. So that could be bad potentially. But so any, remember six rounds is 36 seconds. Guys traffic is coming in and out of the tunnel and you know these devils are approaching. There's like dumpsters around, let's actually go ahead and go, let's go over to Roll20 and get you guys in here to take a look at what's going on. Cause you have six rounds to set up before enemies are here. Let's go take a look at the map gang."
"Emily: Okay so these cars, which side is what?"
"Brennan: Just like the Holland Tunnel in real life to the north of you is the exit of the Holland Tunnel. This is the entrance of the Holland Tunnel. So both lanes are heading into this tunnel here. There are these six toll booths. Or sorry, yeah, there's a couple of toll booths up here, but all of the traffic is heading into it. You also have all these dumpsters around and and sort of everything else like that. But the traffic is coming in to this place here. JJ is going to post up like on this little railing."
Zac: So we're on the Jersey side right now and that's to New York is—
"Brennan: Yes, that's going east under the Hudson River to New York."
Zac: Okay.
"Siobhan: How about this? I have, I can cast Disguise Self at will. So what if I disguise myself as a traffic cop?"
"Brennan: Ooh, very cool. I can dig that. Iga, yeah, for sure."
"Siobhan: And maybe we can, I can have you guys set up barricades."
Zac: For cars.
Lou: I also—
"Emily: I was going to say that because of this, this size I can cast Darkness which means which no one can see through. I can cast it right before JJ. So there could be an area that anyone who entered would be blinded but I can see in the dark so I could attack them."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Sofia, go ahead and give me double, give me doubled up, give me advantage Arcana DC15."
"Emily: Okay. I got it, I got it exactly at 15. I have plus one and I got a 14."
"Brennan: This is the exact one that as the head warrior of the monastery you would know, devils have devil’s sight so they—"
"Emily: Ah, thank you."
"Brennan: Yeah, no worries."
"Emily: Nevermind, ignore that."
"Brennan: So Iga, you disguise yourself as a traffic cop, as a traffic cop what is it you want to do?"
"Siobhan: I got my, my gloves on and I'm just like stepping out boldly in front of this traffic. I'm waving, I'm like whistling and waving and just stopping the cars."
Brennan: Okay so a bunch of—
"Siobhan: Right that's what we, we want to stop the traffic right? That’s what we wanna do?"
Zac: I think we want to block it up with traffic is what I think.
"Siobhan: Right, yeah."
"Zac: So if we could, I think if we could block cars in the most narrow portion of it, that would be best."
Siobhan: Sure like kind of where Cody is.
Zac and Emily: Yeah.
"Emily: I can also cast Pass Without Trace on us if we want that, just for this experience. We might be able to get like a stealth round on whoever the first person who comes through is?"
Zac: That sounds good.
"Ally: I mean, I would love to go look for that figure with you."
Emily: You want to do that?
"Ally: If we're really stealthy, I think that would be pretty interesting."
"Emily: All right I'll Pass without Trace on everyone. Which means like Sofia Pass without Trace is just like,"
Sofia: No one can see us now.
Emily: And then I cast that.
"Siobhan: Maybe you should, oh that's only if you're trying to be stealthy though right? Like if I'm a traffic cop I don't want people to not see me."
Emily: Yeah I can not cast it on you.
"Brennan: Cool, Pete and Sofia are going to use their six rounds to jump over to this billboard and investigate. Awesome, Pass Without Trace, vwoom, shadows wrap around everybody. Iga, you're going to go direct traffic. Sounds like Ricky saying let's use these cars. So are you going to commandeer vehicles from people?"
"Zac: No I just, I'm going to stop them and maybe move some of these traffic cones in a line in front of the traffic and be like there's an accident down the tunnel."
"Murph: I actually have an awesome, I have a great move I can do here. Cody is going to use, I'm going to Channel Divinity Dreadful Aspect as an action, each creature of your choice, you can see within 30 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is frightened of you for one minute. If it moves more than 30 feet from you it can attempt another saving throw. So I think Cody, how the hell would he do this? I think he's just going to, is this cool with everybody? We're trying to start a traffic jam, right?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
Zac: Ohhh. Gotcha.
Murph: It's just getting people to run away because presumably they're just going to be people and they'll have low Wisdom saves.
"Zac: I'm wondering if these New Jersey devils have cars, right?"
"Emily: I think that’s how they’re getting in, I bet."
"Murph: Oh, so you want me to wait?"
"Zac: No, I don't really have a specific thought. Other than like maybe cars will be barreling through."
"Brennan: Cool, this is all happening super fast. So I'm going to say to everyone there's not too much coordination that can happen. People kind of just gotta wild out and do what they're going to do. Iga, you go full traffic cop. Cody, you shout at people?"
Siobhan makes traffic cop motions that sort of look like the robot.
"Murph: Yeah Cody, Cody's just gonna go around and do wheelies on his moped. And he just has, I guess if he could do any kind of magical Paladin thing of like lighting his sword on fire and just screaming and doing, just Omnislashing the air."
"Brennan: Cool, Iga, toll booth operators from up at the front talk to you, go like, they're like,"
"Operator: Officer, are we, are we shut down?"
"Iga: No, there's just, there's an accident down the tunnel, we're we're cleaning it up. Shouldn't be too long, but yeah. Yeah shut it down."
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a Deception check.
Lou: Can I give Iga the help action?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Siobhan: Thank you. I got a 24. Is that high enough?
Brennan: Yes it is.
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: So we have some stopped traffic up along that area.
"Zac: I'd love to take the car that's right next to Iga and get to the driver and be like,"
"Ricky: Listen, I'm a former firefighter. I need to take over your car."
Zac: And commandeer their vehicle.
Brennan: DC20 persuasion.
Siobhan: I'll give him the help action.
"Zac: What did I get? Persuasion, 12, I got a 12."
"Murph: I'll use dreadful, I'll use Dreadful Aspect."
Cody: Get the fuck out of the car!
"Brennan: The person screams, crawls out of their window without opening the door. All the drivers of these cars have fled. And now there's a crunch of traffic around you. I'm going to say that Cody, Ricky, and Iga have done everything they can do, Kingston, anything else from you?"
Lou: Let me go talk to JJ.
Brennan: Yes.
"Lou: I think along with Death Ward which is not concentration, I'm going to Enhance Abilities on JJ and give him advantage on Intelligence checks with Fox's Cunning."
"Brennan: Hell yes. You walk over, JJ is shaking there [holds one shaky hand up] as he's getting the spell ready to start going."
"JJ: [panicked breathing] Okay, okay here we go."
Kingston: Hey JJ?
JJ: Yes?
Kingston: You know everything you need to know. You are prepared for this. You are about to help a lot of people right now.
Lou: And I just touch his shoulder.
"Brennan: For a moment, the hands of millions of other people counting on this one young wizard touch his shoulder as well with reassurance. He goes,"
"JJ: Got it, got it. This is just applied mathematics, that's all, let's get to work, here we go."
Kingston: Let’s get to work.
Ally: Woo!
"Brennan: Amazing, last bit of the puzzle, Pete and Sofia you're over on that billboard?"
"Emily: Yes, we're stealthing over there."
"Ally: Being as like stealthy as possible, really looking over our shoulders."
"Brennan: Dope, go ahead each of you give me either an Arcana or a Perception check."
Emily: Okay.
Ally: Ooh baby that's a 27. Arcana.
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Emily: I got a 17, Perception."
"Brennan: 17, Sofia, this place is clean as a fucking bone. If you didn't know better, you'd be like there was nothing here. Nothing has been here. Totally, totally fine."
Sofia: Trick of the eye?
"Brennan: Pete, 27 Arcana. [mysterious, dark piano] You've been sleeping well the past two weeks, you haven't heard from Nod in weeks. You haven't heard from the Gray Orphan themselves. You have not heard from the Monarch of Dreaming. And for a moment you see their face in your mind's eye looking up at you, and moving away like something being taken out by the tide into the deep ocean."
Ally: Okay. Can I cast Detect Thoughts and see if we pick up anyone's presence like around us that we can't see?
"Brennan: The same feeling that Ricky and Cody got looking into the mist. Normally Detect Thoughts comes back with yes, there are thoughts here or no, there are not thoughts here. It comes back with N/A. You don't get a response from the spell. Something like static."
"Sofia: Pete, I there's one thing I didn't tell you yet because I just haven't had a chance. In the books they talk about Nod being a Monarch of, you know the Gray Orphan being a monarch of Nod but they don't say the monarch. They just say a monarch."
Pete: Oh.
"Brennan: [imitates thunder crashing] Thunder crashes, and you see the red light coming from the Jersey turnpike heading right down to the Holland Tunnel, lights, you hear the smashing of Smirnoff Ice bottles and a horde of devils descends on the Holland Tunnel."
Zac: Can I move closer to JJ?
"Brennan: Yeah this is your last, this is your last chance to get in position real quick."
"Emily: Okay, where is the, where is the billboard in relation to this?"
Brennan: The billboard is off the map a little bit but you and Pete have time to run back.
"Emily: Okay, so we can, hop—"
"Brennan: And I would say, I would say start on the edge of the map somewhere."
Zac: These devils.
Siobhan: They’re incredible.
"Emily: On the edge, on the other side, on the devils' side? [laughs] On the edge."
"Brennan: So that devil that we're seeing in front of us right now that is a siege devil on Roll20, salmon board shorts. Those guys are 16 feet tall. They are giants. [growling] These swarm devils in the cargo shorts are only about two feet tall. They're holding mini like airplane bottles of vodka and Smirnoff Ice and screaming and chatting to each other like,"
"Devils: [a little garbled, Jersey accent] Yeah dude, we’re goin’ to fuckin’ Manhattan, I know a guy who’s gonna get us into his club, baby! Let’s fuckin’ have a good time! [cackling]"
Siobhan: God this is so triggering.
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: And then you see, the Jersey Devil himself. A camel-headed, fanged, horned, winged monstrosity with multicolor shades, a backwards pink hat, a sort of like fluorescent, a fluorescent,"
Ally: A Juul! [laughs]
"Brennan: [claps] It's got a tank saying, let's get weird and a Juul. You see that he approaches the toll booth. Everyone that listened to Cody, so Cody has successfully got all human beings, you did the main thing to do, which was remove human beings from the fray. So, so the, even the toll booth operators have fled. the Jersey Devil strides up and Cody your chest burns."
[metal music]
"Brennan: Bazathrax from within your chest speaks in a voice that everyone can hear going like,"
"Bazathrax: Hey, hey dude, good to see you buddy."
"Brennan: You hear the Jersey Devil [vapes his Juul] And a cloud of noxious vape mist comes out of his mouth. He goes,"
[metal music turns into dubstep]
"Jersey Devil: [extremely Jersey accent] Yeah dude, fucking heard there was a good time happening in New York this weekend my guy. Who's your fucking friends? These guys look like herbs, huh? What's going on?"
"Cody: Why don't you smoke a real cigarette? You fucking piece of shit. Let me tell you something, asshole. [takes drag from cigarette] I grew up in Jersey City [pointing to himself] and there's a new Jersey Devil."
"Jersey Devil: Yo, let's stomp this motherfucker, dude. You're fucking dead, guy."
"Cody: You're fucking dead, dude!"
Murph: I pull the moped… [laughing]
Brennan: Roll initiative! Everybody roll initiative.
Emily laughs.
"Zac: Oh, god. Already my favorite fight of all time."
"Siobhan: Ooh, bad."
Emily: Oh I rolled really poorly.
Brennan: What'd you get?
Zac: Nat 20. Nat 20.
"Siobhan: Okay, there we go."
"Zac: I don't know that's that great for this, where we're waiting on people to attack."
Brennan: Okay.
"Emily: Brennan, I have a question. When you said on the edge of the map, do you mean on the right edge? Or the left edge?"
Brennan: You and Pete are going to start either below that yellow dumpster or you should start up above those trees that are forming that little median strip.
"Emily: Okay I'll go behind the yellow. Ah— yeah. No, no, I'll go from the trees."
"Pete: Yeah, me too."
Siobhan: Can I use luck points for initiative?
Brennan: Yeah you can use luck points for initiative.
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: I think, right? Cause they're just an ability check."
"Siobhan: Attack roll, ability check, or a saving throw or when an attack roll is made against you."
Brennan: Initiative is an ability check.
Siobhan: Great.
Ally: There we go.
Murph: Brennan can I start a little closer? I would assume—
"Brennan: Yeah go for it, dude."
Murph: Sweet thank you.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: [laughs] Just remembering how this all started. I was so excited to see Ricky not—
"Murph: It was, we did talk about it behind the scenes that Cody grew up in New Jersey. And I wasn't sure if it was going to come up or not but I feel like there needs to be some, I was going to say good Jersey representation, but Cody is not good Jersey representation but [makes a face] better than this dude maybe?"
"Brennan: Incredible. Real quick, okay so Sofia, what's your initiative?"
Emily: 8.
Brennan: Iga?
Siobhan: 19.
Brennan: Cody?
Murph: Also 19.
Brennan: Pete.
Ally: 21.
Brennan: Ricky.
"Zac: Oh, also 21 because I— nat 20 plus. One."
Brennan: Kingston?
Lou: 22.
Brennan: Hell yes.
Emily: Oh my god.
Siobhan: Oh my god. I shouldn’t—
Emily: You guys are all hanging out and then I'm down at eight.
Siobhan: I shouldn't have used my luck point at all. Everybody got such good initiative.
[Ally laughs]
Brennan: Amazing.
"Siobhan: I was like, 19! I'm in, I'm in the mix."
Brennan: JJ goes at the end of the round as he's getting ready to start casting his spell. First in the initiative is going to be Kingston Brown. Kingston that is you.
"Lou: I mean, I look at JJ and be like,"
"Kingston: Hey. I'm never going to be far. If you need help, you yell."
Lou: And I'm gonna run 30 feet ahead which is about right there. And then I'm gonna cast a Guiding Bolt on the Jersey Devil. Yeah. Let's just do it.
Emily laughs.
"Lou: And we'll make it, it'll be a second level Guiding Bolt on the Jersey Devil."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, what's the range on that?"
"Lou: 120 feet, he's 115 feet away from me."
"Brennan: Hell yes, go for it. Let me know what you roll on your attack roll."
"Lou: Great. That's a nat 1. So, get the feeling, doesn't hit."
Brennan: Your magic goes out and gets a little bit too close to Jersey and fizzles out.
"Lou: Oh, I go,"
"Kingston: Mm. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why I don't go to that state. That's why I don't go there. Oh."
Brennan: Any bonus actions from Kingston?
"Lou: No, not this turn."
"Brennan: Cool, Pete that is you."
"Ally: All right I am going to, I don't have to move so from where I'm at I am just going to cast Erupting Earth. I'm going to cast it as a fourth level and I'm going to cast it over here so that I can get as many people as possible."
Brennan: Cool and what's the radius on Erupting Earth?
"Ally: 20\. 20, baby."
Brennan: Hell yes so that's a 20 foot radius circle—
Siobhan: But that's 20— That’s a 20 foot—
Ally: Cube.
Emily: Yeah. So that would be 40.
"Brennan: Sorry where are you casting this on again, show me?"
Ally: 20 foot cube and I want it to be at these turnstiles. I'm going to try to hit both of the second largest guys.
"Brennan: The siege devils, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Ally: And then everyone behind them for a 20 foot cube. They're 20 feet apart from each other so 20 feet back should be one, two three, four, five, six, seven, eight guys. Plus them too."
Brennan: That should work just fine. Yeah you should be able to hit eight of the swarm devils and two of the siege devils.
Ally: Incredible. Okay. And so I am going to roll 4d12 and they can save for half.
Brennan: That is correct.
Emily: Does it make it difficult terrain too or something?
Ally: Yeah it does. At least one minute to clear by hand. Each five foot portion of the area takes at least one minute.
Emily: Sweet.
Ally drops their dice offscreen; Zac laughs.
Ally: Meant to do that.
Ally rerolls their dice and makes an ooh sound.
Ally: 29 damage.
Murph: Nice.
"Brennan: 29 damage, hell yes."
[Lou makes a rolling brrrah! sound.]
Ally: And that's with rolling a 1.
Brennan: And what type of damage is that?
"Ally: Let's see. Dex throw, bludgeoning."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: And now it's difficult terrain. Each five foot is—
"Brennan: Oh shit. We're— we are now going to roll for our little swarm devils behind them. The two enormous siege devils go,"
"Siege Devils: [exploding sound] [very deep, growling voice, Jersey accent] Bro, fucking take it easy, what's your problem?"
"Brennan: Amazing. Three of them, so it's going to be— Five of them behind the toll booths erupt in asphalt and are crushed as you [makes sound of falling rock] shatter them with Erupting Earth. The three underneath the toll booth managed to jump into the toll booths and hide but are badly injured as well. You, by the way, see again, this is the vanguard. All of the rows stretching behind them is hundreds and hundreds more devils just like these ones in an ever— never-ending onslaught. That is Pete's turn, Ricky that's you."
Zac: Gosh. There's hundreds behind them?
"Brennan: Uh huh, you see giant hulking siege devils. These swarming devils that starts to scream with wicked infernal glee as they approach."
"Zac: I don't want to be too far away from JJ, but Kingston do you feel like you have him for now?"
Lou: Hell yeah Ricky go get'em.
"Zac: Okay Ricky's going to use Ox's movement and get forward to near, near his best friend Cody."
Players laugh.
"Zac: Gosh, actually, you know what? I might delay my turn. Just because looking at this. Cause I don't know if I can. If I get there in time then I'll just be killed by 30 devils I feel like."
Murph: Do you have any way to lower somebody's like saving throw thing? Like curse them in any way?
Zac: I don't think I do.
Murph: Okay.
Zac: I'm just going to actually hold my turn cause I'm not sure what I could do yet.
"Brennan: Okay cool you hold, you're just like holding the line. Iga, that's you."
Siobhan: Fantastic I'm going to use as a bonus action I'm going to activate my Elemental Gift so that I can fly. And I'm just going to fly up to this cab right here.
Brennan: Dope.
Siobhan: And then I am going to cast Synaptic Static which is a 20 foot radius so a 40 foot diameter which I think gets everyone. All of these devils.
Ally: Ooh.
Emily: Ooh.
"Brennan: Synaptic Static, hell yes."
Siobhan: It's a 20 foot radius sphere. So it might miss these two outlying guys but I think it gets everybody else.
Emily: Whoa.
"Brennan: Where Pete just did his thing, cool, right there yeah."
Siobhan: So that like it's 20 feet in this direction and 20 feet in this direction.
"Brennan: But you want to, you want to catch the Jersey Devil in that as well?"
Siobhan: Yes I absolutely want to catch the Jersey Devil.
"Brennan: Okay, amazing. What's the save for Synaptic Static?"
Siobhan: It is an Intelligence saving throw and I have a DC17.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. And it's a save for half, correct?"
"Siobhan: It's a save for half and if they, um. If they fail a target has muddled thoughts for one minute. During this time it rolls a d6 and subtracts that number rolled from all of its attack rolls and ability checks as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration."
Brennan: Holy—
Siobhan: And then it can make a save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.
"Brennan: The three that survived Pete's Erupting Earth, the swarm devils, are utterly destroyed. And go ahead and roll damage for the larger ones and the Jersey Devil."
"Siobhan: 21, 27 damage each."
Lou: Whoo!
"Brennan: 27 damage each, Jesus Christ. What does that spell look like as Iga's casting it?"
Siobhan: I think it looks like almost like nineties science fiction effects lightning. So it's all like green like buzzy weird lightning that's frizzy around the edges.
"Brennan: Incredible, [makes buzzing electric noise] and you said 27 damage right?"
"Siobhan: Yes, 27 damage and then if they fail, they take that effect."
"Brennan: You see that the northernmost one, the one sort of behind the taxi cab near the toll booths is affected and gets, it does get that minus six."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: And then the Jersey Devil has to make the save of course. Amazing, let's see here, Jersey Devil is strong. Nat 20 on the save for the Jersey Devil."
Siobhan: Dang.
Zac: Ugh.
"Brennan: Terrible. But that is still, that is still not an inconsiderable amount of damage. It becomes 13 damage to the Jersey Devil. That moves from Iga's turn and is now going to be Cody."
"Murph: Hell yeah. [makes vroom-vroom noises] I take the moped, drive up 45 feet to the Jersey Devil, give the Jersey Devil the finger,"
Cody: Fuck you dude!
Murph: And shove my finger like into his face. And I'm going to cast Bestow Curse.
Brennan: With a middle finger!
"Murph: With a middle finger. You touch a creature, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. I get to choose the nature of the curse, I'm choosing, while cursed the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails it wastes its action, and that turn it does nothing."
Ally: [whistles] Amazing.
Murph: So this is a big Wisdom saving throw. I hope it fails. DC16.
"Brennan: The DC is 16? The Jersey, the Jersey Devil needs a nine or higher and rolls with advantage."
Players gasp.
Murph: Fuck.
"Brennan: So we're going to roll twice. I'm going to roll, I'm going to roll Box of Doom style because this is pretty huge. So you need, you need an 8 or lower twice. Here comes 2d20."
The Jersey Devil rolls an 11 and a 2.
Siobhan: Fuck.
[various groaning]
Lou: My heart races when you do this.
Emily: I know!
Murph: All right.
Brennan: Terrible.
"Murph: Fuck. Okay, well."
"Lou: Cause it's not even Brennan's reaction anymore, we get it like straight."
"Murph: Cool, very cool stuff. Cody just goes,"
Cody: Fuck!
"Murph: And I guess, is going to keep driving so that he's not right in front of the Jersey Devil. And so people have to move to get to him. So Cody is then going to take, actually fuck it. He's gonna. The, the moped has warhorse stats. So can I do a Trampling Charge at it and try [laughing] to run it over with my moped?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
Murph: Great.
Brennan: Go ahead and make an attack roll.
"Murph: [reading] If the, if the moped moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with its hooves' attack—its tire attack. Okay. That's a fucking 9. I'm just going to drive away."
Zac: [face in his hand briefly] You have a Questing Blade. You have a Questing Blade.
Murph: Cody does a trick. [motions as though turning a moped’s handlebars]
Cody: Would have been fucking cool if my spell had worked.
"Murph: And I guess I'll take the attack of opportunity if I have to, to move back again. Cause what did I take? 45 feet of movement? I'll move another 15 feet away."
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a Constitution saving throw.
Lou: No!
Murph: Jesus Christ.
"Emily: Please age 20 years, please age 20 years. [laughing]"
"Murph: No, no more. Yeah, sure. You got it. It's fine. This is all good."
Brennan: What are we looking at Cody?
Murph: This is fine. That's a 23.
"Brennan: Oh, incredible."
"Siobhan: Oh, okay."
"Brennan: You, so you go, you moped up. [screech noise] Flip the Jersey Devil off and turn to go, to turn back. As the Jersey Devil is like, pulls the Juul off his lip, and you take 10 points of poison damage and then 17 points of slashing, sorry, of bludgeoning damage as the Jersey Devil punches you with a poison fist in the back of the head as you try to moped away."
Cody: Ow! Fuck—
"Jersey Devil: Fuck you, watch out for the sucker punch motherfucker."
"Cody: Fuck you, dude!"
Jersey Devil: [laughs meanly] Got your ass!
"Lou: Cody, what are you at?"
Murph: 56.
Brennan: But you do moped away. Cool.
"Murph: It doesn't even, I don't know. I literally have all the same stuff as you guys. I don't know why, I dunno why I suck so much ass."
Brennan pulls up the icon of Cody’s moped steed on roll20.
"Brennan: Oh my God. And is that, is that where you're ending your turn Cody?"
Murph: Yeah I only have 15 more feet.
Siobhan: Your electric bike.
Ally: Your little fucking Dutch bike.
Murph: It's a fucking moped!
Lou: My man's steed!
Murph: I think I call it a moped and it's just like a bike with a motor on it.
Siobhan: Those ones that just give you a little help when you're going uphill?
Murph: Yeah it just gives you help when you're going up.
"Lou: Oh, fuck this."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Cody: You don't even have to pedal when you're going up, it's only when you're going up super high that you have to pedal. If you're on like flat you can just let that fucking—"
Zac: You just never pedal that thing.
"Cody: [imitating frantically pedalling, high-pitched] Fuck! [laughs]"
"Brennan: Okay. You don't have anything bumping your AC, do you, Cody?"
Murph: [laughs] No.
Brennan: Okay. Poor Cody.
Cody: Get the fuck out of here.
"Brennan: Cody, you take three poison damage and 11 slashing damage. As the Jersey Devil says,"
"Jersey Devil: Bros, bros get this fucking guy. He tried to fucking flip me off."
"Brennan: And you see this one goes,"
"Swarm Devils: [panting, scrambling noises] You got it boss!"
"Brennan: Little cargo shorts, and leap up onto you and begin to slash and attack you from all sides. Horrifying! After that, these siege devils are going to go."
Lou: [laughs] No. No.
"Brennan: Ooh, baby."
"Zac: Can I, can I go now?"
"Brennan: Oh but if you want to, yeah you see the siege devils point at Cody. Ricky, you may absolutely go now."
"Zac: Okay I want to drive. I mean, not drive, ride Ox up to this cab. The one that's like here. So use Ox’s movement to get there. And then this is just an abandoned cab that's on?"
Brennan: Yep yep yep.
Zac: I want to hop in it and reverse over the little demons next to Cody.
Cast laughs.
"Brennan: Incredible. Go ahead, so object interaction to get into the cab. I'm going to say make a, make a Dexterity based attack roll for the first swarm demon. You, if you miss by more than five, something bad happens."
[tense music]
Murph: Oh my god.
"Zac: 19, I rolled a 19 plus one so 20 if that's just my Dex."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll 4d6 plus five damage.
"Zac: Okay. Ooh, good rolls. I got 20 on the, the d6 plus 5?"
"Brennan: 20 on the d6, so 25?"
Zac: Yes.
Brennan: Amazing. Go ahead and make another attack roll if you'd be so kind.
"Zac: Okay, Dex-based attack roll?"
Brennan: Dex-based attack roll.
"Zac: Ooh, that is a nat 1 and I'm gonna use a luck point."
"Brennan: Burning through our luck points, okay."
Zac: That would only be a 10.
"Brennan: A 10, okay. A 10 is not going to get the job done so you don't get both. But Ricky, you back the cab up and crush the swarm devil on the other side of, the one directly above Cody. You like, [screeches] throw it into reverse, Ox is in the passenger seat. Ox uses his mouth to buckle himself in. Safety first."
[Emily laughs]
"Ricky: Thanks, Ox."
Cody: Fucking hell yeah dude! We're like the Rock and Vin Diesel.
Zac: I just don't respond.
"[Murph, Ally and Emily laugh. Murph makes revving noises.]"
"Brennan: Yeah you back up and crush, crush that first one. Boom gone. Amazing. However, now these two siege devils are going to go. This one gets the minus six to everything. Boom, boom, boom. Up here has 10 feet of reach. This dude going through here, 10 feet of reach."
Murph: Jesus christ.
Siobhan: That's good to know that they have 10 feet of reach.
Brennan: Yeah this is going to suck. Um.
Lou: You’re— You suck then.
Emily laughs.
"Lou: Oh, this looks awful."
"Emily: I know, I know."
"Brennan: Ricky, I'm going to need you to make. Uh, god, what am I going to need you to make here? I'm going to need you to make a Dexterity saving throw."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: Trying to beat a DC18.
Emily: He’s in a car!
Zac: Natural 20.
Brennan: Hell yes.
Siobhan: Yes.
Ally: Yes!
"Brennan: Okay so that's only going to be… Um, hold on."
Zac holds up his d20 but it keeps fading into the virtual background.
Emily: It’s on 14. [laughing]
Zac makes some little groaning noises as he spins the d20.
Emily: It's so hard to share it.
"Brennan: Ricky, you are going to take 4d12, plus, gonna need a Dex save for Ox, no actually on a nat 20, Ox is going to be okay. You see, but that's going to be eight, 15, 18, 28, 34, 38, of damage to Ricky and 21 points, and I'm going to say on a nat 20, no damage to Ox here. That the siege devil goes,"
Devil: [garbled yelling] Fucking see you later bro!
"Brennan: And picks up the cab and hurls the cab 40 feet in the air. Because Ox is buckled, he's okay, but you take 21 points of damage."
Ricky: I can't believe I didn't buckle up.
Sofia: It’s been a tough day.
"Kingston: Hey, you were too busy trying to save a friend."
Zac: What direction am I hurled?
"Brennan: You are going to be hurled, you're hurled all the way over here. So let me, I'll show you where you land. You're there in a smashed cab. Boom, whips you away. And that one is still gonna take some more swings after that. Ooh, terrible, misses Cody horrendously, and doesn't have reach with the next attack. So it's done."
Murph: Great.
"Brennan: This dude over here is going to take a swing at Cody once. That's going to be a hit and that's a hit as well. Both of those fists, that's going to be, Cody you take 12 points of bludgeoning damage and then 16 points of bludgeoning damage with two mighty fists, boom, boom."
Murph: Jesus. Cody's hurt!
"Brennan: Okay, more devils coming through. These devils all rolled very similar initiatives, which is not ideal but what are you gonna do? Okay let's see."
"Lou: Cody, you're at 14?"
Murph: Yes.
Brennan: These guys here are—
Lou: [laughing lowly] Oh man.
Cody: Oh! Fuck!
[Lou laughs]
"Brennan: This guy's going to take his full movement to close, and this guy is going to make it here to close as well or not to close with, Cody—"
Zac: Were these happening roughly at the same time or am I out of range at this point?
"Brennan: These guys, these are all happening roughly around the same time."
"Zac: Could I use my reaction to take the 16 points with Aura of Guardian from Cody? Cause I can, I can take, Aura of Guardian is when a creature within 10 feet of you takes damage you can use your reaction and magically take the damage instead."
"Brennan: Go for it, I will let you take that damage, absolutely."
"Zac: Well, it doesn't say per attack though. When a creature within 10 feet of you takes damage you can use your reaction to magically take that damage. Could I just take both of those hits?"
Brennan: You can take both of those hits from Cody if you would like to.
Zac: How much was that?
"Emily: Sixteen and twelve, I think."
Lou: 28.
Murph: Wow.
Zac: I'm so mad.
"Lou: Ricky, what are you at?"
"Pete: You sure you want to do that? You don't have to, you don't have to do that."
"Ricky: [surprisingly aggressively] It's fine, I wanted to do that. I like to help people, that's my thing. My thing is that I help people."
"Lou: Ricky, what are you at?"
Zac: I'm at 55.
"Murph: Jesus, you have so much HP!"
"Brennan: I'm going to need a Con save from, from Cody."
Murph: 11.
"Brennan: Okay. Oh no, oh no. Cody, you see the Jersey Devil looks right at you. Eight, three is 11. Another eight is 19, 29 plus 30 is 59 points of necrotic damage."
Murph: Super down.
"Brennan: This is a Finger of Death spell. You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you see within range causing searing pain, a humanoid killed by the spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your orders to the best of its ability."
Murph: Fuck.
Ally: Shit.
"Emily: Oh, okay wait it rises its next turn?"
"Murph: Wait, I wasn't killed through right?"
Brennan: Huh?
"Murph: I wasn't killed, I was knocked out."
"Brennan: You were knocked out. A humanoid killed, I'm trying to see, yeah let me, let me double check the wording of this spell."
Murph: I'm pretty sure I'm still alive.
Emily: Wouldn't killed be being knocked out?
"Brennan: Well, it didn't, it didn't do more than double your, no."
"Murph: No, I was at like negative 15."
Ally: What did it roll for that attack?
"Brennan: It didn't roll anything. This is just a save. So you see, as you speed away on your moped you can feel Ricky taking the damage. The Jersey Devil goes,"
"Jersey Devil: Dude, you could have fucking come and partied with us. Instead you gotta be a fucking asshole about it? I see how it is, bro."
"Brennan: And mist pours out of his mouth from his infernal Juul. You cough splutter and you see Bazathrax goes,"
"Bazathrax: Dude, I'm so fucking sorry, this guy's very powerful."
"Brennan: And you drop to zero. That's the Jersey Devil. This guy is going to go. This dude is going to start charging. Yeah, this dude charges the truck and boom, boom, boom, [crash!] is going to knock it out of the way and attempt to crush Ricky with it."
Zac: Jesus.
"Brennan: Gonna make an attack roll here, his Dex is not as good as his Strength. He's gotta roll, a 12 or higher to hit Ricky, either way he's moving the truck out of the fucking way. We'll do Box of Doom, see if he gets Ricky."
Emily: Natural 2! [laughs]
"Brennan: Natural 2, the truck sails past you and lands in between Ricky and Sofia, still in hiding. But these siege devils are going to clear the way for their swarm devil buddies. Incredible. Sofia, that's your turn."
"Emily: Okay, okay. Should, I'm wondering if I should go retrieve Cody? Cause I don't want him taking any more hits. I think that I'm going to move a little bit forward here. So move basically 15 feet so that then I can teleport to right on this truck right here and attack. And then I think if I wanted to carry Ricky and run away would that be like an action?"
Zac: Cody?
"Emily: Oh, sorry if I wanted to carry Cody, if I wanted to pick up Cody would that be an object interaction or would I need—"
Brennan: It is an object interaction at the moment.
"Emily: So I can use my attack action. Then hop down, pick up Cody and then just take a bunch of opportunity attacks as I run away?"
"Brennan: Basically yeah, absolutely."
"Emily: Okay so I'm going to, from here I'm going to attack this siege devil right here."
Brennan: You leap to the top and you're at perfect eye level with this hulking giant on top of the truck.
Emily: That is a 16 to hit.
Brennan: 16 does not hit.
Emily: Okay I'm just going to try to attack him again. Does a dirty 20 hit?
Brennan: Dirty 20 hits.
Emily: Okay so I only hit him for 6 but I will try to Stunning Strike him.
"Brennan: Hell yes. Guy's got a beefy Con save, but... does make the Con save there."
"Emily: Okay he does make the Con save, okay well I did six damage to him and then I'm going to—"
"Ally: Can, can I Bend Luck on that and take away from his Con save?"
"Brennan: What do you roll, what do you roll on Bend Luck? The die that you roll?"
Ally: A d4.
"Brennan: Cool, this dude, you have to get a three or higher on the d4 to do Bend Luck here."
Ally: Box of Doom?
"Brennan: Box of Doom? Yeah, go ahead and roll it on Roll20."
Ally rolls a 2.
[various groaning]
Brennan: Oh no!
Emily: Fucker! Okay.
Brennan: Still makes the save.
"Emily: But I'm still going to, since I have Jump cast on me I am going to jump over all these guys. So hopefully the sheer leap would mean that I wouldn't take any opportunity attacks until I shoulder Cody. And then I think I would have"
Siobhan: The big guys are a 10 foot reach anyway so you wouldn't take an opportunity attack.
"Brennan: Until you leave exactly, cool. You rush with Cody on out of there."
"Emily: Okay, so yeah, I grab Cody and I move over here."
Brennan: Cool. Cody's moped is left behind.
Murph: Fuck.
"Brennan: You're going to get, you're actually only going to get a swing from that one siege devil. An 8, let's, I don't think that'll even do it. Four plus 10 is 14. Misses."
"Emily: All right, we traded misses."
"Brennan: After Sofia, this last siege devil down at the bottom is going to start going, charge here to this car. Boom, boom, boom, and flings this car over the side spinning it wildly out of control. After that siege devil..."
Emily: So we need these cars to like stay where they are don't we? We need to clog this up.
"Zac: I mean ideally, but it just feels like they just tossed them like, you know, like they weigh nothing."
"Emily: Yeah, like we need to stop them."
"Zac: Yeah if we could stop the siege devils, it could be good."
Brennan: All of the remaining active swarm devils take a double move and move 80 feet forward.
Ally: [whispering] Fuck.
Lou: Nightmarish.
Brennan: Incredible and at the end of that round JJ is going to make an Intelligence check. He gets a plus eight to this roll—
Emily: And advantage.
"Brennan: And advantage because of Fox's Cunning. Making an Arcana check first round. He only needs to hit a 15. He's gonna roll 2d20. We'll roll it in front of the board. So for this one he, all he's going to need is plus eight, is just gonna need a 7 or higher on one of these two rolls. 16!"
"Siobhan: Yes! Yes, JJ."
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: You guys look over at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel and watch as the, watch a runic circle of glowing golden light. Kingston you see, he is like harnessing, like waking world magic going like [energy buzzing] as this rune appears glowing in front of you—"
"Kingston: Atta boy JJ, atta boy, let's keep it moving! [clapping]"
Brennan: We are back to the top of the initiative order with Kingston Brown.
"Lou: I yell over to Ricky,"
"Kingston: Ricky, can you help Cody?"
Ricky: [after a moment] Uhh…..
"Kingston: Great that's a pretty good answer,"
"Lou: I'm going to move. I'm gonna move 10 feet up or I'll move like a full 15 up. Fifteen feet up and that should put me within 60 feet of, yep, 50 feet away from Cody and I'll cast Healing Word at a third level. Yeah let's do it. Okay. Oh, it's gonna be four, three, one. So eight plus, eight plus five, 13 hit points back up for Cody."
Murph: Thank you.
Brennan: Whoo!
Lou: And then can I also cast a cantrip?
Brennan: Yes you can cast an action cantrip if you need to.
"Lou: Great and then I'll throw a Sacred Flame at the, the little, the little demon next to Madam Anastasia."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. And does that, he's making a save right?"
"Lou: A Dexterity saving throw, 17."
Brennan: He fails.
"Lou: Yee haw, okay. He takes, that's going to be 15 points of damage."
"Brennan: You obliterate him with [energy noise] a street lamp light from the City of New York. You incinerate that swarm devil. No more, baby."
"Lou: Great and then I'll honestly, I'm gonna move back 15 feet, so that I'm never, not so far away from JJ."
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: Cool, that's my turn."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. By the way, I'm going to need some, some concentration checks from Ricky for those concentration spells that you took."
"Zac: Okay, you're right I'm sorry. I don't remember what I—"
"Brennan: Second one's going to be a DC 16 I'm pretty sure. And the first one, the first one I think is just a DC 10."
Zac: 15 and then a 22.
"Brennan: Okay so that second one was the DC 16. You pass both you hold, you maintain concentration. Awesome. Pete, that is you."
Ally: Okay I am going to try to get these three demons in front of me.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: And maybe one more? I don't know they're all looking like they're about 30-35 feet away from each other. Can I try in a big circle to get two on the outside?
"Brennan: Yeah, what spell are you casting?"
"Ally: Oh, I'm going to be casting a Fireball spell but burning a sorcery point to make it Careful and make sure I don't hit Iga or what's his name."
Brennan: Misiek.
Siobhan: Misiek.
"Brennan: Give me, give me a DC15 Arcana check real quick."
"Ally: Oh right, fire."
Brennan: Yep.
"Ally: Okay, all right, thank you. [laughs]"
Brennan: No worries.
"Ally: Thank you, okay I'm going to take a full dash action to JJ. I can get there I believe, does that work?"
Brennan: Yeah you're just going to take a double move?
Ally: Going to take a double move and then I'm going to burn two sorcery points actually for Quicken Spell.
"Brennan: For Quicken spell, hell yeah. Yeah you do take five points of falling damage cause you're leaping down to the bottom of the tunnel from the ridge there."
"Ally: Yeah, worth it. Honey, I'll do it. And then I'm going to cast Greater Invisibility on him."
Brennan: Oh my god.
Emily: Wow.
"Brennan: Is that concentration, Greater Invisibility or no?"
Ally: It is.
Brennan: Cool and you didn't have anything else active right?
"Ally: No the difficult terrain one doesn't, Erupting Earth doesn't, isn't a concentration."
"Brennan: Dope as hell. Amazing. JJ looks around, the Vox Phantasma, the Vox Populi, champion of New York, the chosen one of the Order of the Concrete Fist, everyone has active magic on this dude right now. He’s like,"
JJ: Okay! [typing]
"Brennan: And you see it as he goes invisible. He say,"
"JJ: Good, good. This is, this is support. This is what support feels like."
Emily: He has Pass Without a Trace and Greater Invisibility and Death Ward—
Zac: And Sanctuary.
Emily: And Sanctuary.
Zac: And Protection from Evil and Good.
"Brennan: Amazing. Ricky, that's your turn."
"Zac: Cody, how's Cody looking?"
Cody: I'm fucked up just don't—
Murph: Cody looks at the ground.
"Cody: Just don't even fucking worry about me, man."
Ricky: Okay.
"Cody: I fucked up, just fucking, just fucking make sure they don't fucking get in, dude."
"Zac: I'm going to move to this siege devil right here with Ox. I'm just going to take, pull out my Peasant’s Sword and say,"
"Ricky: Well, you know, I wasn't planning on fighting until I felt like a weapon found me and I guess this is that weapon. So it's awesome."
Zac: And I'll take two attacks—
"Cody: It's, it's a pretty good sword, Rick."
Emily: “Rick!”
"Zac: [rubs his forehead] I don't look at Cody. [laughs] So I'll take a first attack at that guy. Oh, you know what? Since we were close enough, actually Ox is gonna go first and use his attacks just to hopefully cause he gets Pack Tactics."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
"Zac: Oh, I mean, I guess if it's a, is it, it's not 20 from there to here it's not 20 feet, he couldn't charge him could he?"
Brennan: He could run away and then run back?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Does he get, does he get a special charge thing? Oh yes, yes, yes, that target must, yeah, absolutely you can have him do a charge."
"Zac: We'll do a charge. And I feel like this guy's probably gonna not be knocked down by a Dalmatian, the siege devil--"
Emily: Be so cool if he was though.
"Brennan: He succeeds on, he does succeed on his save."
Zac: Okay.
Ally: David and Goli-woof?
Emily: What? [laughs]
"Siobhan: Nice. Freakin’ nice, dude."
Ally: Nobody liked that.
Emily: So uncharacteristic.
"Zac: Oh I actually, I have to make an attack roll on the charge. So I'll just make that roll."
"Brennan: Go for it yes, yes, yes."
"Zac: Okay that's a, what does he add to his hit? I rolled a 19."
Brennan: Nineteen hits.
"Zac: Yeah okay he's not knocked over. So that was the charge. So that's, that's his turn, nevermind."
Brennan: No he also makes a bite attack as part of that. So you can have him roll his bite attack.
Zac: All right so he'll roll his bite attack.
"Brennan: And he has, yeah, he has advantage on these as well."
"Zac: Oh, then I'll roll."
"Brennan: Cause he's, cause of Pack Tactics."
Zac: Oh right right. Five plus four.
"Brennan: Nine points of damage, hell yeah!"
Zac: Did we establish that his bites are radiant damage?
"Brennan: Yes so it bypasses the, yeah his bites are radiant damage. So the siege devil, as the Ox bites into his giant, like hoof or like his giant clawed ankle and then Ricky, that's you baby."
"Zac: Okay now it's Ricky's turn. Ricky,"
"Ricky: I'm not an angry person, but you know this thing is, it's time for it to get out of here."
Zac: First attack is only a 12 to hit.
Brennan: Twelve does not hit.
Zac: And I will not use a luck point because I feel like I'll need them later. Second attack is only a 16.
Brennan: Sixteen is a miss as well.
Zac: Okay I think Ricky is so mad that he's just swinging wild.
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Devil: Hey dude look at this guy, look at this fucking guy trying to hit me dude. Hey, what's your problem, man? Nice fucking sweat pants. You know it's Friday night, right?"
"Ricky: What are you wearing? What kind of, do you even have pants on?"
"Devil: Dude I got my fucking pink, I got my salmon board shorts, dude. It's peacocking, let the ladies know."
Sofia: Ewww!
"Ricky: Okay well, I really don't know if I can have a conversation with you."
"Cody: Tell him to fuck off Ricky, tell him to fuck off."
"Ricky: I'm not going to tell him that, Cody— Maybe you just—"
"Cody: Get the fuck away from Ricky, dude!"
Ricky: Okay.
"Brennan: That's going to be Iga, that's you?"
Siobhan: I think I'm gonna fly up to just this railing up here.
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: And I'm going to just Eldritch Blast these little wieners.
Emily: Yeah!
Lou: Get those wieners.
Emily: Blast those wieners!
Ally: Get those little wieners!
Lou: Get those wieners!
Brennan: Go for it.
Emily: Those wieners!
Ally: Oh my god all the little charms on JJ.
JJ’s roll20 icon is covered in little spell indicators for all his buffs.
Lou: JJ's decked out dude.
Siobhan: So funny.
"Ally: You can't even see him, he's just under all these Mardi Gras beads."
Siobhan: So the first one is a 25 to hit.
"Brennan: 25 to hit, that is a hit for sure."
Siobhan: 11 force damage and four bludgeoning damage. On this first guy closest to me.
"Brennan: Both of that magical, correct?"
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: Oh, that's 15 damage total?"
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: Iced, blasted away with an Eldritch Blast."
Siobhan: Okay for the next guy that's a 24 to hit.
Brennan: That hits.
Siobhan: And that is also 15.
"Brennan: Next one is gone, toast."
Ally: Nice.
"Siobhan: Sick. Oh, by the way, when she flies it does look like wires are picking her up. She's got a full wired rig underneath her clothes."
Zac: I want to see whatever bad movie she came out of.
[cast laughs]
Brennan: That's going to be... okay.
Ally: [suspiciously] No.
Lou: No.
"Ally: Whatever it is, no."
Lou: Anytime Brennan gets quiet it means he's being thoughtful. Which means he's going to do bad things.
Murph: Didn't I have the same initiative that Siobhan did? Is Cody going?
"Brennan: You did, so Cody goes now, sorry yes. Cody, you are next up."
"Murph: Okay, Cody is in over his head."
Emily: Trying not to get killed.
"Murph: He’s had a bad day. I wipe my nose of blood, and turn to Sofia, embarrassed and go,"
"Cody: Fuck. Thanks, uh, thanks."
Sofia: You owe Kingston a little thank you as well.
"Cody: Thanks, Kingston. Thank you, Ricky, fuck!"
"Murph: I look at the siege devils. This one has like a minus thing. They have something wrong with them, right?"
Siobhan: They have to take 1d6 away from all of their rolls.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Murph: Nice. Okay I know this is killing me as a paladin to not just swing. I guess first off I guess I'll look down at my sword and be like,"
Cody: Are you anything other than just like a cool-ass sword? Or do you like fucking do like weird shit that could help right now?
"Questing Blade: I can become as rad as you wish me to be. We must talk, you and I, about what it is you wish to do. I am the Questing Blade. Whatever your journey, I am here to aid you."
"Cody: I want to get these devils like the fuck outta here. Do you have like a, like a, like a way to just like give them the finger and they just like fucking run?"
"Questing Blade: Not at the moment, but you could enchant me later to have that power."
Cody: Fuck!
"Questing Blade: I guess all I would say is just like, just like value me. Just like treasure me, you know?"
Zac: Ricky is like hearing this conversation from behind. [stares intensely]
"Cody: I'm going to hang you on my wall, dude, just fucking wait. All right, fine."
Zac laughs so hard he disappears out of frame for a bit.
Murph: I put the sword back and I'm going to cast on the one that has the subtraction from the rolls. I'm going to cast Crown of Madness to attempt to charm it so it has to attack other creatures.
[Emily and Brennan ‘ooh’]
"Lou: Oh yes, there we go, Cody, there we go. [clapping] Bring it around!"
Brennan: And this is a Wisdom—
Cody: I am the true Jersey Devil. [holding hand out like an anime villain]
"Sofia: Again, not about you though."
"Brennan: This is a Wisdom saving throw, correct?"
Murph: Yes.
Murph continues to hold Cody’s fucked-up casting pose.
"Brennan: Okay, your DC is 16. This guy gets a plus seven which means--"
Murph: What?! To Wisdom?
"Brennan: To Wisdom, that's correct."
Murph: This dude is throwing cars?
"Brennan: But I'm going to say this, plus seven but we're going to roll a d6. I'll roll Box of Doom. Let's see how much is subtracted."
Emily: Oh right!
The d6 rolls a 6.
[cheering]
Emily: Oh! We’re subtracting six!
"Brennan: So this is so six, so that means seven. He's gonna need a.. what's that? Oh Jesus. He needs a 15 or higher to beat this. Rolling in the Box of Doom."
Siobhan crosses her fingers.
[cheering]
Brennan: Natural one baby.
Murph: Yes! Yes!
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"Charmed Devil: Dude, you're the fucking Jersey Devil?"
"Brennan: The siege devil next to him says,"
"Siege Devil: Bro, he's not the fucking Jersey Devil. Wake the fuck up dude."
"Brennan: And he says,"
"Charmed Devil: Oh don't fucking talk to me like that. Go fuck yourself, bro, you want to fucking go?"
Brennan: And who would you like this dude to attack?
Lou dances.
Siobhan: Yes.
"Murph: I would like him to, let's see. Does he have enough movement to get to the guy going after Ricky?"
Brennan: Yes he does.
Murph: Let's do that.
"Brennan: Incredible. It's on his initiative, he will act and his initiative is coming very, very soon."
"Devil: Shut the fuck up, let me fucking think, bro."
"Murph: Okay, and then I also have so my, presumably my moped works like Find Steed. So it's like magical and can move without me?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Murph: Sweet, can I hop on my moped? And I'm going to go ahead and can I do so it can get 60 feet. I would like to do a trampling charge on this guy up here."
Lou: There we go Cody.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and make your attack--"
Lou: You did all the way back around.
Murph: Sweet. I want to use my movement to hop on my moped and then try to slam into this dude.
"Brennan: Cool go ahead and make your, make your attack roll."
"Murph: Fuck, 9."
"Brennan: 9, does not hit I am afraid, but you close with those other devils for sure. After you, you guys see more devils charging in from the turnpike are appearing. Bam, a group appears and is going to charge immediately towards Sofia."
"Emily: That's good, I could take a little damage."
Zac: Are they in that difficult terrain or do they bypass it?
Brennan: They are bypassing that difficult terrain. So these guys go to surround Sofia.
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: That's going to be the siege devils. So this dude is going to boom, boom, boom, rush here. Charge his buddy, I'm going to say Murph go ahead and make these rolls for me. I'll say you're adding plus 10 to all of these rolls, let me know what you hit. You're gonna make, you're gonna make three. You're going to make, actually just making one attack. You're just making the gore attack."
"Murph: Yeah, I think it's just the one. I think it doesn't take it, yeah."
Brennan: Yeah cool.
"Murph: Must use this action move to make a melee attack against, against a creature."
Siobhan: It would also be minus the d6 still.
Murph: But I got a 17.
"Brennan: You got a 17 to hit, you do not hit. So the other guy puts his arm up and—"
"Murph: Or I got his, oh sorry. I wasn't adding his bonus, I got a natural 17."
"Brennan: Oh you got a 27. So even with a minus six, he rushes up, dude, these guys charging is no fucking joke. I'm going to need you to roll 7d10 plus seven."
Siobhan: Oh my god.
Lou: Whoa.
Murph: Should I just do it in front of the table here?
Ally and Emily: Yeah!
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it. And you can add you can add the plus seven there to let us know what you get. I'm going to roll a saving throw as well. Cool he does not, no wait a minute. Ooh! 40 damage. Not only does he do 40 damage, he knocks this dude fully prone. He goes, runs up and he says,"
"Devil: Stop fucking laughing at me, bro. I got mind magic on me!"
"Brennan: And boom this other giant goes sprawling. This dude is going to charge for Ricky. This is a bit, Ricky your armor is your armor class is 21, correct?"
Zac: That's correct.
"Brennan: This dude is going to, but you already know these guys get a plus 10. This guy rolls an 11 or higher, it's bad news for Ricky. Fifteen."
"Ally: Bend Luck, d4?"
Brennan: You couldn't--
Zac: Eleven or higher.
"Brennan: Yeah, you couldn't possibly."
"Ally: Oh, right, right gotcha."
Murph: You could use a luck point on—
Zac: Could I use a luck point on his attack?
"Brennan: Yes, you could."
Zac: Yeah I guess I should. I'm going to do that.
"Brennan: Let's see, and I'm going to ask this time or do you want to Bend Luck on whatever this roll is, Pete?"
"Ally: I could, yeah."
Brennan: I want to ask you ahead of time before I announced what the roll is.
"Ally: Oh because, oh cause I can do it after it's rolled but before I hear the effect or something like that."
"Brennan: Okay gotcha yes yes yes. Yeah, no, let's do it here we go. So using the luck point, that is a natural five."
"[Emily cheers, Murph claps]"
"Zac: Okay, good."
"Brennan: So boom, boom, boom. Ricky, you hold this peasant sword aloft, hold up a shield of light. [groans] And this demon stops just short of impaling you on his horn."
"Ricky: Oh, I'm just lucky I guess."
"Brennan: Incredible, more swarm devils are appearing at all times baby."
"Emily: Why is the Jersey Devil staying there, right?"
Siobhan: I think we got to take him out.
Emily: I think we have to go after him right?
Murph: You think so?
"Ally: I mean, these people have plus 10. It's got, maybe it's some sort of like he's giving them something. Or maybe it's just natural."
Emily: I'm like wondering if like he's the reason that they're—
"Zac: I mean they're following his lead. He is the Jersey Devil, you know? I think he's like commanding them, like hanging back."
Emily: Yeah that's what I'm thinking.
Zac: Or like commanding his troops. Not like magically commanding.
Emily: Yeah but I'm wondering if we get him if they stop?
Murph: Yeah I was wondering if this is like a tower defense like we're just trying to save JJ. Or if this is cut off the head of the serpent here.
"Zac: It could be a bit of both, you know."
"Brennan: Two more swarms of swarm devils show up charging forward,"
"Swarm Devils: Yeah yeah boss, get them, get them!"
"Brennan: And you see the Jersey Devil does look like he's kind of enjoying hanging back vaping. He's like,"
"Jersey Devil: Come on, dude. I know a fucking spot. We're gonna head down to the lower East Side. There's a buddy of mine, who fucking knows this great place. We're going to in piss in everything, shit everywhere. Put fire on everything. Kick a bunch of ass, fucking torch the spot. And get fucking wasted dude!"
"Brennan: I'm going to need Dexterity saving throws from Ricky, Ox, Sofia, and Cody."
: Can I ask who's doing--
Brennan: The Jersey Devil is casting a spell right now.
Siobhan: Counterspell.
Brennan: You're within 60 feet?
"Siobhan: Fuck, I'm not, 80 feet."
Zac: I'm going to Counterspell.
Brennan: You have Counterspell?
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: Oh thank God.
Brennan: Holy shit!
Zac: Oath of Redemption!
"Emily: God, I got a nat 1 on my save—"
Murph: Are you serious?
Emily: So please fucking Counterspell.
Zac: Oath of Redemption has Counterspell.
Siobhan: Sick.
Ally: Amazing.
Murph: That’s insane!
"Brennan: Oh my god. Okay this is a high level spell. This is a sixth level spell. So Ricky, you need to roll, god, incredible, 10 so it's a DC 16. You're adding plus four. You need to roll a 12 or higher to counter this spell."
Zac: Okay. Natural 20.
[cast cheering]
Brennan: Oh my God.
"Zac: I’ll show you, I’ll show you."
"Zac tries once again to tilt his camera down, foiled by the background."
"Emily: We can't see it, we can't see it."
"Ally: It never works, it never works."
Zac: Give me one second.
Zac turns off the background and displays a legitimate nat 20.
"Brennan: Amazing, oh my fucking god."
Lou: That’s real.
"Emily: That was, I rolled a nat 1 on my save. Just so you know, I would have been so fucked."
Brennan: Dude a fucking—
"Murph: I rolled a nat 5, I would have been fucked."
"Brennan: That was a, that was 10d8 lightning damage coming your way. That was a Chain Lightning spell. You see he goes,"
"Jersey Devil: Dudes, fuckin’, why do we got these douchebags coming here and fucking bothering us? We're just tryin’ to have a good time, bro. I want to take a piss in that moped's gas tank. Come on, man, give me a break."
"Ricky: Hey, you know what?"
"Cody: You fucking try, dude!"
"Brennan: You see Ricky, he sucks in the Juul, summons lightning into his hand, goes to hurl it, what does Ricky do?"
"Ricky: You know what? I'm not a mean guy by any means but I'm going to tell you right now, knock it off."
[cast laughs]
Ricky: Cut it out. Cut it out.
"Brennan: [laughing] You see the lightning, he like swallows it as it goes back down his gullet."
Jersey Devil: No no no!
"Brennan: As again, your pure sense of responsibility to the people of this city protects the you and your companions from this lightning. That is amazing. This Jersey Devil is powerful but he does not have legendary actions. You shut down an entire turn from the Jersey Devil. Jesus Christ, dude."
"Zac: I've never hit, I feel like I don't hit nat 20s when I need to hit nat 20s, and this season I have."
"Brennan: My god, dude."
Emily: Yeah!
Siobhan: It’s been very good.
Lou: It feels good.
Emily: Oath of Redemption indeed.
"Brennan: Okay we got some attacks incoming from this siege devil who stands up from prone. And is going to go for Ricky. [sucks in a breath] Ooh baby, okay. Two of those hit, I'm going to need a Strength saving throw from Ricky."
Zac: 18?
"Brennan: 18, okay 18 passes. You are, you hit by this thing and not knocked prone, which is incredible. But you are still going to take some damage. It's going to be 2d8, 4d10 plus 14, for 11, 14, 23, 31. Ricky takes 45 points of damage."
"Zac: Okay, I am at 10 hit points."
"Brennan: He goes boom boom,"
"Siege Devil: Fucking lay it off, man."
"Brennan: Sofia, that's your turn."
"Emily: Okay since I have Jump on me, can I so I'm 40 feet away from the Jersey Devil. I'm starting to think we need to really do something about him. Can if I jump to him would that mean that I only take opportunity attacks from these four? Who are surrounding me?"
Brennan: You would only take opportunity—
"Emily: So I'm like jumping into the air and then landing on the Jersey Devil. So I would take it from, I'm assuming these four that are around me, but maybe not these—"
"Brennan: And the one, and the one siege devil has reach to hit you. So you would get some swings from the swarm devils around you. You could bonus action disengage."
"Emily: I don't want to, I'm going to take the opportunity attacks."
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: She wants the damage.
Siobhan: Get that radiant damage.
Lou: She wants the damage.
"Emily: But I mean it, to a certain extent."
"Brennan: Sofia, from the swarm devils, you take nine points of slashing and eight points of poison. And the siege devil misses you with his swing."
"Emily: Okay, cool. And then I land on the Jersey Devil. That's, I haven't used, that's just my action. And I'm just going to start attacking him."
"Brennan: Holy shit, great."
Emily: First attack is going to be a dirty 20.
Brennan: Dirty 20. He throws Shield up as a reaction. Dirty 20 does not hit.
"Emily: Okay, I gotta keep trying. Second attack is going to be a 23?"
Brennan: 23 exactly hits.
Murph claps his hands.
"Emily: Okay, awesome. I hit him for only six but I'm gonna do a Ki point to Stunning Strike."
"Brennan: Okay hold on one second. This does not qualify as magic so he does not have advantage against it. You said six points of damage, right?"
[dramatic music]
"Emily: Yeah, six points of damage. And then I'm going to try and stunning strike him."
"Brennan: Okay, that's a Constitution. Is that Constitution, I believe? Yes."
"Emily: Yeah, Constitution."
Brennan: Constitution he does not have advantage. And he only has a plus two.
Emily: It's a DC15.
"Brennan: Okay we're going to roll. He needs a 13 or higher to get this done. Nat 20, brutal."
"Emily: Okay that's fine, I'm gonna Flurry of Blows. To try to hit him again. Definitely hits, it's a 24."
Brennan: Yep.
"Emily: I'm only going to hit him for seven, but I'm going to try and Stunning Strike him again."
"Brennan: Hell yes. You're, he's looking okay. This guy looks like he's a big sink of hit points, but."
Emily: I know.
"Brennan: But the stunning will fuck him up for sure. Here comes his next roll, 13 or higher? 17."
"Emily: Okay that's fine. I'm going to try to hit one more time. Cause I have one more Flurry of Blows. It is also going, oh that's 29. Okay and then I'm going to hit him again for another nine but I'm going to try and Stunning Strike him one more time."
"Brennan: Jeez, brutal. You can see, you guys can see the Ki radiating off of Sofia just bam bam bam, this Jersey Devil's like,"
"Jersey Devil: Whoa dude this fucking chick, wait dude you're from Staten Island, right?"
Sofia: Yes.
"Jersey Devil: Dude I can always fuckin’ tell, people always mix us up but you can always tell, what are you doing later?"
Sofia: [aggressively] No one thinks I'm from Jersey.
[Brennan laughs]
Sofia: Never once.
"Brennan: 13 or higher, third saving throw."
"The die is very briefly on 20, but rolls onto 2."
Brennan: 2!
[cheering]
Murph: Yes!
"Siobhan: Oh God, that was so close."
Emily: Fucking finally!
"Brennan: As you say, as Sofia says, “No one has ever thought I'm from Jersey,” she leaps up full corkscrew, roundhouse, boom. And he stumbles on his ass, holding his head, wobbling in the fucking air. Incredible! This dude goes after Sofia. He is going to rush towards his boss, goes, boom boom makes an attack. Flings this semi out of the way."
Murph: Jesus.
"Brennan: Boom, makes it here. And it's going to hurl that car at Sofia."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: And I'll roll this in front of the board too, Sofia is at 19 right now; on a 9or higher he's going to hit with this car."
"[Lou sighs in relief, Emily cackles]"
"Brennan: 3, Sofia goes full matrix. You spring into the air, backflip as this red sedan sails—"
"Emily: Can we say that the car comes through and both the doors, both the doors are open and so I sort of dive through the car?"
Brennan: Yes!
Siobhan: So sick.
Zac: It's like Spiderman for sure.
"Brennan: So fucking sick. Bam, crashes into and crushes this truck behind it. And that's that dude's turn."
Zac: Can I ask a question?
Brennan: Yeah go for it.
Zac: Do we have a sense if more of the siege guys are coming or if it's only swarm guys?
"Brennan: It looks like there's more siege guys way in the back. There they're much more spread out. It's mostly swarm devils. Okay, these swarm devils that are already further along this one's going to come for Iga. These three are going to, think they're all gonna try to make it to Kingston at the same time. Yeah cause it's difficult terrain there for them because of all these cars. So they can't make it to Pete in the same round. Two of these coming for Iga."
Murph: Does my moped get an opportunity attack?
"Brennan: No, it does not."
Murph: Fuck.
Brennan: Iga takes four slashing damage and nine poison damage. Kingston—
Siobhan: That's 13 damage?
"Brennan: Yes, 13 damage all together. And Kingston is going to take boom, boom. These guys hit Kingston. Oh, these are all cocked. Oh my god. Six attacks and not a single one hits Kingston from these Jersey devils."
"Lou: Be cool, be cool."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: [snarling] Incredible, that is the end of the round. The DC now goes up to DC20 Arcana check. Our, our boy JJ calls back. He says,"
JJ: Okay I'm on it!
"Brennan: You see he looks at you, Pete and says,"
"JJ: [very quickly] Okay, they can't see me right now but maybe I should stop talking. Am I alerting them to my presence by talking out loud?"
"Pete: You're good, man. Hey, just take a nice deep breath."
Ally: I pour him some really nice tea.
JJ: Oh my god in the middle of a fight? You're incredible.
Pete: Just have have a sip.
Brennan: [imitates drinking] He takes it.
Pete: I'm a peace boy now.
[Brennan and Emily laugh]
"Brennan: Okay, he, he's rolling with advantage. He just needs one of these to be a 12 or higher. 2d20…"
JJ rolls a 14 and a 16.
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: Hell yes. The next layer of runes comes in. [magical buzzing] He calls out and says,"
JJ: I'm almost there. I just need to put the last layer of runes on.
"Brennan: You guys are doing good, man. The DC will go up to 25 on his next roll. So he will need, he'll need a 17 or higher on the next one. He wouldn't have made it this turn. Incredible, back to the top of the order. Kingston Brown, that is you."
Lou: Okay a weird question. Are any of these cars a Tesla?
[Siobhan laughs]
"Brennan: I'm gonna roll, I'm gonna roll a luck check--"
Zac: A Musk check?
Brennan: A Musk check. Good grief.
Murph: Oh no.
Ally: [waggling their finger scoldingly] Oh no. Oh no.
"Brennan: I'm going to say, I'm going to say on a six or higher there's a Tesla here. Yeah, 19 hell yeah there's a, there's a fucking, I'm going to say the car right in front of you is a Tesla."
"Lou: Question okay, I have a spell called Remote Access where I can, I can use any electronic device within range as if it were in your hands. Because a Tesla is an entirely electric car, can I use this spell to drive the car without being in it?"
"Brennan: Kingston, 100% yes."
[heroic orchestral music]
Ally: Yes!
"Lou: Okay. Okay my dreams came true, now what do I do? I was like is this even, I was so ready to be shut down. Okay."
Ally: It says Tesla now! That's so funny.
The car’s image in roll20 now has “TESLA” written on it.
Lou: Great. I would like to whip this Tesla around and drive it toward Ricky and Ox.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Lou: And I would like to, how much movement does a Tesla have?"
Brennan: A tremendous amount of movement.
"Lou: Can it charge the siege beast, pick Ricky and Ox up and drive them back here all in one turn, is that possible?"
Brennan: Can it pick up the siege beast?
"Lou: Oh, excuse me can it drive over, it doesn't need to attack the siege beast, can it go pick up Ricky and Ox and drive back?"
"Brennan: I'm going to say that, I'm going to say that Ricky and you act on almost the same exact initiative. So I'm going to say that you can effortlessly get this to Ricky with its movement and have it open its doors and ready an action to do something when they get back in."
"Lou: Great, that car drives around toward, toward Ricky."
"Brennan: Someone's brand new Tesla gets the shit scraped out of both of its doors, as it goes up on the curb, so Kingston you look at the car and as you look at the car, there was only one thing that would have prevented you from being able to do this. But you check the Tesla. It's got a set of New York plates and that's all you need."
Lou: There it is.
Brennan: Boom! The emblazoned buildings of the New York skyline on its license plates. The car [buzzing] turns on and listens to the commands of the Vox Populi. Incredible.
Kingston: Go get Mr. March.
"Lou: Oh yeah, that happens. And then I dunno, I'll hang out. Yeah that's the end of my turn I think."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, very fucking cool. Incredible, you call a car to your aid. Absolutely amazing. Pete, that's gonna be you."
Ally: I'm going to take a full dashy to right here.
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Yoink! Yeah, then I'm gonna use a Quicken Spell and I am going to cast a Cone of Colds up at all of these guys. I think I can hit all of these guys."
"Brennan: Oh my god, okay you can hit all of them. I'm trying to think of, because Ricky is there—"
"Ally: Oh, I'll hold for Ricky and the Tesla plan. ‘Cause I heard them shout that out and then I will get ready to cast Cone of Cold immediately as they skirt away."
"Brennan: So Kingston, as Kingston effortlessly is just boxing with these swarm devils knocking their things out of the side. You point this Tesla, Pete, and you see Pete make JJ vanish and sprint after the Tesla, the Tesla whips around to Ricky and Pete, you crouch down in between this parked sedan and cab with your hands at the ready, you ready an action to cast Cone of Cold. Ricky that is going to be your turn."
"Zac: If Ox takes a disengage, do I have to, or I'm not sure how that works."
Brennan: No he can take a full disengage action on your turn.
"Zac: Okay well Ox, using Ox's movement we'll get in the car with his disengage."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: And then I'm just because I'm so hurt I'm gonna give myself 30 hit points with the Lay on Hands.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: And then come back up to 40.
Brennan: Dope.
"Zac: And then just ride the Tesla back into the middle of the, like next to Cody and get out."
"Brennan: Incredible, you, and you're moving further towards the entrance of the tunnel right?"
"Zac: Yeah, I just want to be right next to Cody. I mean not, I don't really, but I want to be in that spot. [laughs]"
Brennan: Cool.
Cody: Are you thinking like a double team move here?
"Zac: Just quietly, like park the car and get out, like."
Ally: [laughs] Silent treatment?
"Ricky: Yeah, yeah, like a double team."
"Zac: Like just, nothing behind it."
"Brennan: And Pete, this is a 60 foot cone, right?"
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: Okay. I'm trying to see something right now. Jesus Christ.
Zac: Can you see a cone effect?
Emily: If the Jersey Devil is in that you can I think he'll automatically fail cause he's stunned.
"Brennan: He is not, he is just outside of range but—"
"Emily: Oh, okay."
Murph: Could Pete move though?
"Brennan: No, Pete's used all his movement to get where he's at. However he can hit literally every single devil up in this cluster here. And most of the ones over here, Pete, go ahead and roll damage."
Emily: Do I need to do a Dex save? It's fine if I do.
Brennan: [laughs] 38!
Ally: Yup.
Zac: [hands in his hair] 8d8?
"Brennan: And are you you're trying, cause this is not Dex. So Sofia cannot evade this. This is Constitution. So you're, and Sofia is also out of range anyway, so."
Ally: Yeah yeah yeah.
Emily: It would have been fine if I got hurt.
"Brennan: First of all let me just show you Pete how many, how wide the cone is number one. Okay it's a 45 degree angle. So you, you probably want to favor the big chunk with the siege devils, right?"
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, that's true."
Brennan: Okay so boom—
Ally: With those three siege devils.
"Brennan: Without having to make any saves every one of these swarm devils is gone. [screaming, explosion] You stand up from between the two cars. Raw freezing cold from the deep dreaming covers everybody. The DC is 17. These guys have some beefy fucking Con saves but we'll roll here. Yeah, their Con is plus 13. Both make it, then the one that is the minus six, oh one rolls a, Siobhan, go ahead and roll a d6 for me?"
Siobhan: A 1.
"Brennan: A 1. Okay, he passes as well. It's still half damage. So 38 is still going to be 19 damage to every one of these dudes. Incredible. Some of these guys are starting to look hurt. Cool, that is Pete and Ricky's turn, that's going to move on to now be Iga."
"Siobhan: I think I want to, since the Jersey Devil is stunned, cast Synaptic Static again, but I'm worried about Sofia."
Zac: Could you hit pretty much all of them but that top devil?
"Emily: I think don't, you also don't have to worry about me cause I'm at 67. And if I get hurt I'll start doing radiant damage. So I'll be able to hurt the stunned devil more."
"Siobhan: Yes, but I'm just worried about you having to just take this d6 away."
"Brennan: Iga, you can set it off south a little bit and just hit the Jersey Devil. The only, the only issue is you'll just be missing that one swarm devil above Sofia. You'll hit pretty much everybody else."
"Siobhan: Right yeah, so yeah I guess I'll do that."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: So I’ll, it's 8d6."
Emily: That means the swarm devil will automatically fail this right?
Siobhan: Yes.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Do they, would they automatically fail?"
Emily: If he’s stunned.
Zac: The Jersey Devil?
Siobhan: The Jersey Devil.
Brennan: Let me look up stunned with Intelligence savings. Do you automatically fail saving throws while stunned?
"Emily: I don't know, I guess I just assumed."
"Murph: Oh, maybe not Intelligence. I think it's just Dex."
"Emily: Oh, automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving rolls."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: Did not roll very well.
"Brennan: No worries, let me know what you got."
Lou: Let me know what you got!
Siobhan: Twenty.
"Brennan: Twenty, okay. So we're going to roll these five Intelligence saving throws for our little swarmy boys. See what they get. They need to hit that 17 and only one does. It's for half damage, right?"
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: Okay so one of them is going to take 10. We’ll have this guy right here, bada boom. And the others, one, two, three, four, [burbling] their brains melt as Iga hits them with the static. This dude right here is going to roll into this, nat 1 on the intelligence save for this dude. He takes the full 20 and now also has that minus six. Jersey Devil is going, this is a spell so he's going to roll this with advantage. And he's got a beefy Int save, but you never know."
Siobhan: You never know.
"Brennan: Let's see here. Yeah this dude's Int save is plus seven. So he's going to get it on a 10 or higher and he's gonna roll with initiative but let's see here comes 2d20. If both of these are 9 or lower, you're in the clear."
The roll is a 14 and a 3.
"Brennan: Ah, dang. But he does take 10 points of damage however."
Iga: Better than nothing.
"Brennan: Amazing. That is Iga's turn. Cody, that's you?"
"Murph: Oh boy. What can Cody do here? I feel like I got to go do some damage here. ‘Cause I don't really have anything else to buff anybody. You say the siege guys, the three that are gathered near where Ricky was, are they're starting to look hurt?"
Brennan: Yes.
Murph: Okay what about this one that's down by Sofia.
"Brennan: Not looking that hurt, honestly."
Murph: Okay.
Zac: Is the one still mind controlled by you?
Murph: One of them is.
Zac: Okay.
Murph: All right I got to just do something maybe a little stupid but I'm going to move I'm gonna use my moped. I'm going to go over to the guy below Sofia and I'm just going to go all out.
"Ally: Here we go, here we go."
Emily: Are you gonna freak out?
Lou: Worked one time.
"Murph: I'll let me see, just this one time, I do it every fight. Let me make sure, okay that's 70 feet. So I had to use a dash so I can't use an attack with my moped so I'm just gonna use my own stuff. Okay, so first things first we are going to do Blinding Smite. So I'm going to do Blinding Smite as a bonus action. So my sword begins glowing and then I'm going to make some rolls to make some attacks. 23?"
Brennan: 23 hits.
"Murph: Okay, sweet, so Blinding Smite is a third level spell. And then I'm going to do a, these guys are devils, right? So they get an extra—"
Brennan: Correct. They get an extra d8 from smite.
Murph: So I'll do also a third level smite.
Brennan: Jesus.
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Murph: Okay so that's, so it's going to be five, so it's going to be 8d8 with Blinding Smite, and then 2d6 for my sword."
Brennan: Yes.
Siobhan: Sick.
Murph: Actually you know what? I can just do it on Roll20. Okay.
[cast ‘oohs’]
Emily: Woo!
Brennan: Oh my god. 56 points of damage.
Ally: You freaked out!
Brennan: You freaked out.
Cody: [screaming] Get the fuck out of here!
"Brennan: This guy's gone from looking not that hurt to extremely hurt. That's your first attack, you have another one."
Murph: That's my first attack. And so I also did a Blinding Smite so it needs to do a Con save. Probably has really good—
"Brennan: If he rolls a one or two, he fails."
The devil gets a 3.
"Siobhan: Ugh, brutal."
Brennan: So close.
Ally: Brutal!
"Brennan: Brutal, absolutely brutal."
"Murph: Sweet. So I will make my second attack. Come on. That is only a 17 to hit? Oh wait, 18 to hit."
Brennan: 18 hits.
"Murph: Okay, I'm going all out just this other time and I will do a, I only have second level smites now. So I'll do a second level smite. So that will be—"
Brennan: 4d8 plus 2d6.
Murph: I literally think I would have missed if I did not have the Questing Blade.
"Ricky: [nodding] Yeah, good."
"Pete: Hey Ricky, you're biting your lip really, it's bleeding."
"Ricky: Oh, is it bleeding? Oh."
Cody: The Questing Blade is now called the Thirsting Blade because it quests for blood! [big sword swing]
Ricky looks down in exasperation.
"Brennan: Cody says that out loud, the Questing Blade shines brighter than either Sofia or Ricky have ever seen it shine. And Cody leaps like Blade, his duster silhouetted against the Manhattan skyline and fully decapitates this siege demon. [devil growling, blood spattering] And does a perfect three point landing."
Sofia: This is what Dale would have wanted. Yeah.
"Ricky: This is, that's a good, that is objectively good for our situation right now. [nods] That's awesome."
"Pete: Yeah, definitely."
"Cody: We did it, we are the real Jersey devils."
"Pete: We? Oh let's not, let's not."
Kingston: You could be.
Pete: Let’s not use any we’s.
Iga: I try not to go to Jersey at all.
"Brennan: Incredible, the next, that swarm is destroyed. Let's see these siege devils over here."
Murph: One of them has to attack its friend.
"Brennan: Oh yes, that's right. And I'm trying to think here. Yeah so go ahead, Murph and give me three attack rolls."
"Murph: Or just does the one, right?"
Zac: Does it charge?
Brennan: Yes.
Murph: Crown of Madness?
"Brennan: Oh no, give me, oh yeah it's just Crown of Madness. Yeah, go ahead and give me an attack roll?"
"Murph: Nat 10. So 10 plus 10, 20?"
"Brennan: So that's going to hit, that's going to hit."
Lou: “Nat 10.”
Ally: Incredible to hear.
Brennan: If you would be kind enough to roll just 2d8 plus 7.
Murph: 19.
"Brennan: The one that gets the minuses takes 19 points of damage. These guys actually act on the same initiative. Holy shit, how am I gonna resolve that? Okay, you see the two siege devils, the one you controlled and the other one kill each other. They literally did enough damage to each other on the same initiative, they go,"
"Devils: Fuck you, dude!"
"The devils punch each other, growling and snarling."
Brennan: And fully waste each other with just that one attack. It's crazy. Both are gone. The next swarms is just going to be the two here around Sofia are going to take attacks on Sofia. Zero hits. Sofia is hit by none of them.
Ally: Wow.
"Zac: So does the one siege guy left go, or is he just?"
"Brennan: He's on a different initiative actually. Bam, these guys appear, big old truck in their way. but they are going to take their turn to get over here to close with Cody and not be able to attack."
Siobhan: God damn. Where are these fucking guys?
Brennan: The hits keep coming.
Zac: The tunnel's just filled with those guys right?
"Siobhan: Yeah, we've got to take out this devil."
Murph: Or we just got to get the wards up right?
"Brennan: The Jersey Devil, this is the turn the Jersey Devil loses correct? So he comes out of stun at the end of this one—"
"Emily: The end of my turn, actually."
"Brennan: At the end of your turn, Sofia, he is still stunned. And hold on one second. This dude sees Cody behead his brother. What's his movement like? Can he get, can he get to Cody? If it's, if it's within 40, he’s charging Cody."
Brennan checks the measuring arrow on roll20. Cody is 42 feet away.
Brennan: Ooh.
Lou: Wow.
Brennan: Just past!
Siobhan: Thank god.
"Brennan: So Ricky, you watch that and get full charged by this siege devil."
All: No!
"Brennan: Again, an 11 or higher. 9, you are missed again. Jesus."
Zac: [running his hands through his hair] Oh my god.
"Brennan: Just you like snap out of watching the Questing Blade glow and Cody's hands to see this,"
Devil: Fuck you guys!
"Ricky: I mean it probably wants to be called the Thirsting Blade, now."
Cody: It thirsts for blood. [sword tricks]
"Brennan: Sofia, that is going to be you."
"Emily: Okay I'm going to Hexblade Curse this, this Jersey Devil. And because he's stunned, I get advantage on attacks against him, right?"
Brennan: You absolutely do. And he also can't use his reaction to cast Shield again.
"Emily: So close. Well, I definitely hit though because I got a 27."
Brennan: That's a hit on the first one.
"Emily: To hit on the first one. Oh, I rolled eight so that's 13. Oh plus my proficiency so 17."
Brennan: And you're rolling advantage on all these attacks right?
"Emily: Just, oh sorry, that was, I did 17 damage now."
Brennan: Copy that.
"Emily: And I just rolled with, with advantage."
"Brennan: And you're adding, are you adding any radiant to this or no?"
"Emily: I'm not, no I'm not low enough."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: So yeah, it's just 17, but I'm going to since I don't know if I'll hit on my second one, I am going to use my final Ki point to try to Stunning Strike him one more time."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, here comes his Con save. Twelve, he needed a—"
Emily: I have 15.
Brennan: Fifteen? He has only as a plus two he needed a 13 or higher.
"Emily: [cheering] Yeah! Okay so now until the end of my next turn,"
Brennan: [weakly] Still stunned!
Emily: And then I'll take my second attack. It it could have been a nat 1 but it was actually a 19. Does a 19 hit?
"Brennan: Nineteen hits, his AC is 18 right now, I'll tell you straight up."
"Emily: Six plus, six plus five plus four, 15. Another 15 damage."
"Brennan: Another 15, good grief. Okay that's your second attack."
"Emily: Yeah that's my second attack. But I used my bonus action to do Hexblade Curse and I used my final, but he's now stunned until the end of my next turn again."
"Brennan: Okay he's looking messed up. He is, this is Sofia has got him up against the cab doing that thing where a really intense boxer is like, you're unconscious but I'm not going to let you fall down. I'm going to body you against this to just keep thudding my fists—"
Emily: Elbows?
"Brennan: Elbows, bam bam bam, as the Jersey Devil flies back again and again. Incredible, these last ones here, we go over to these swarm devils here. Another two attacks on Iga, both misses incredibly. Six attacks coming for Kingston."
Lou: From who?
Brennan: The swarm devils.
Zac: The three devils next to you?
Lou: From who? I don't see.
"Brennan: Miss, miss. Okay finally one hits, dealing six points of slashing and two points of poison damage to Kingston. One slashes you with a dirty Smirnoff Ice bottle,"
[various grunts of distaste from the players]
"Brennan: Going,"
"Devil: Yeah, fuck you, old man. We're trying to get into the city. We heard we could get wet."
Ricky: He just iced Kingston.
Kingston: Get wet?
"Pete: Kingston, you have to drink the whole thing."
"Devil: We could come here and we can fucking get wet, dude."
"Kingston: Get, oh, you children are a nightmare."
Brennan: I'm gonna need a concentration check from Kingston.
"Lou: What's the, what do I need?"
Brennan: It's only going to be a DC 10.
Lou: Okay well I get plus seven. That's a 19.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you do not lose the incredibly important Enhance Ability on JJ at the end of their turn, we're gonna roll it's, JJ needs a 17 or higher here and it will potentially finish the last layer of runes. 2d20."
Lou reaches his hands out to give energy and Siobhan makes a praying gesture.
Zac: JJ.
JJ gets an 11 and a 3.
Brennan: Not going to do it.
Emily: But that just means that devils could get through.
"Murph: Three, eleven, they love it. They're just, they hear amber's the color of your energy. And they're going to go get wild."
"Brennan: JJ is putting the spell. He, you see him reciting magic. He looks back seeing the onslaught of the devils those surrounding Kingston, his spell falters. Because he does not finish it he has another chance to finish it, but if he can't finish it on the next round, the spell will fail from the beginning. He's got to wrap it up on the next round. And that's all for this episode of the Unsleeping City."
Emily: What?!
Siobhan: What? You son of a bitch!
Brennan: Tune in next time to see the thrilling conclusion to the Battle of the Holland Tunnel. Later!
"Lou: This season is wild, man."

(upbeat music)
(hands tapping)
"Brennan: Hello, one and all, and welcome back to another exciting episode of Dimension 20, the Unsleeping City Season Two. I'm your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always, are our intrepid heroes, say, hi, intrepid heroes."
Everyone is pretending to box.
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes."
"Brennan: The left and the right and the upper cut. Gang, it's fitting that we're boxing, because we are mid-combat. JJ, apprentice wizard of the Gramercy Occult Society, is busy putting up a brand new set of runes, given that the other ones were mysteriously erased. JJ has got one last shot. He's got advantage on the roll, but at the end of this round, he needs to hit that 17 or higher to hit the DC 25 Arcana check. Oh, God, JJ's got to do it."
"Emily: We each still have like a round before him though, right? That's where we ended it."
"Brennan: Yes, you have a round before him. And again, it's possible this is just like, JJ, won't lose the spell, he'll have to start over from scratch. So, that's the situation you guys are in right now. We begin at the top of the order with Kingston Brown."
"Lou: Okay. Here's my question to you, Brennan, the DM."
[Emily laughs]
"Lou: Umm. If I… (humming) I don't like any of these options. So, Remote Access lasts for 10 minutes. So I have control of this Tesla for 10 minutes. What am I using to interact with the Tesla? Is it my full action? Is it something less than?"
Brennan: Let me see what this spell says real quick.
Zac: Is it his full action or something less than?
"Lou: [reading] “You can use an electronic device within range as if it were in your hands. This is not telekinesis. Rather the spell allows you to simulate a device as mechanical functions electronically, you are able to access only functions that a person using the device manually would be able to access. You can use Remote Access with only one device at a time,” is what the spell says."
Siobhan: Seems like free object interaction to me.
"Emily: Yeah, right?"
"Brennan: I am actually going to say, listen, this thing does have limits to it. The limits are as if it were in your hands, that's the limitation. So, it requires as much energy and concentration for Kingston to control this Tesla as it would for him to drive it with his hands, which makes it a free object interaction."
Lou: Okay.
[Emily laughs]
Ally: Incredible.
Emily: I love it.
"Lou: Okay, if it's a free object interaction… Okay, this is again, when you tell me I could do anything, it's honestly worse. Like I would have preferred you told me, no, 'cause then it would have been clearer what I should do. Okay, because Cody needs help. Cody is 110 feet away from me. There are three devils around me. Oh, but it's okay. Oh, okay."
Ally: You could hold your action.
"Murph: If it's gonna screw over JJ, I don't know."
"Lou: I don't think… JJ is invisible, but I think we can make this work. Hold on. Can we do this? You tell me, Brennan, if this gets too crazy. I'd like to have the Tesla again do the thing where it scrapes against the wall. I’d then like to disengage, to run and hop in the Tesla. I'd then like to be driving the Tesla closer to Ricky et al and cast a bonus action spell. Can I do all those things?"
Brennan: You may do all those things.
Lou: Fantastic.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Yes, we descend back into the Manhattan entrance of the Holland Tunnel, where the apprentice wizard JJ is currently invisible. I believe he has invisible, Death Warded, Enhanced Ability—"
Emily: Still Pass Without Trace.
Brennan: Pass Without Trace and—
[Emily laughs]
Zac: Protected from Evil and Good and Sanctuary.
"Brennan: Protection from Evil and Good, and Sanctuary all on this dude."
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: Buzzing with some of the most powerful magic in New York. As the rest of the heroes of New York do their best to keep JJ alive and safe long enough to complete this spell. Cody has just decapitated a siege devil with the Questing Blade that has chosen him as most worthy. (laughs)
Murph laughs and pretends to swing a sword.
"Brennan: Ricky just healed himself in the back of a Tesla with Ox. Sofia is just crushing the Jersey Devil’s jaw with elbows increasingly soaked through with blood. Bam, bam. As Pete, the tips of his fingers covered in frost from absolutely obliterating an entire swath of devils a moment before. As Iga flies over the railing, engaged with the swarm devils up above. Kingston, you whistle, the car swerves around, the siege devil on a natural 4, misses with his attack of opportunity on the Tesla, peeling away. (imitates car moving fast). The car swings around, the driver's side door opens up, next to you as the car heeds your command."
"Lou: Great, I hop in. Yeah, I use a disengage."
Brennan: So that's your action. You have movement and bonus left.
"Lou: Great. I'll use whatever Kingston's movement, plus the Tesla is. (laughs)"
[Emily laughs]
"Lou: To drive like, path back. He's already used this reaction hopefully on the first opportunity attack. Drive past the siege devil within 60 feet of Cody and cast a fffffffourth level Healing Word."
"Brennan: You roll for that Healing Word. I'm going to roll 3d20 for the Athletics checks for the swarm devils to grab onto the Tesla, thinking that you're trying to get away."
Lou: Great.
Brennan: They need 14's or higher. Let's see what they get. Two of them successfully grab on.
Zac: Oh shit.
(laughing)
Lou: Okay.
"Brennan: So you see, as you just jump in to close the driver's side, two of them have latched onto the roof, Kingston grabs the wheel, hits the gas and the Tesla zooms forward. And is about halfway between Pete and Cody."
Murph: Great. And how much was the Healing Word?
"Lou: Oh, hate to, only 15. I'm sorry. I wish I could have done more."
"Murph: Okay, thank you. Appreciate it."
"Brennan: No worries. Okay, that's going to be… So that is now Pete Conlan. Go for it, Pete."
"Ally: I am going to use my movement, 30. Might take an opportunity attack from this guy, to my right. But then I am going to… Hands are still cold, might as well just keep casting Cone of Cold, but I am going to turn around and cast it behind me and try to catch everyone who's there."
"Brennan: Ooh, hell yeah."
"Ally: I'm only going back this way, so JJ doesn't get attacked."
Brennan: Gotcha.
"Ally: I could probably hit more people, if I was facing forward towards you guys, but."
"Brennan: No, you're doing the exact job that you guys came here to do. Go ahead and give me a DC15 Arcana check real quick."
"Ally: Oh, yeah, 26."
"Brennan: I'm going to say that, because the Tesla has a strange geography to it, it's a moving car, you can run up and hit both swarm devils on the Tesla without harming the Tesla."
"Ally: Incredible. Yes, I would love to do that."
"Brennan: You can hit literally every single devil in between you and the entrance to the tunnel with that Cone of Cold. Even the one up over the railing, like you go ahead and roll damage, my dude."
"Ally: All right, That's 8d8."
Brennan: Ooh.
Ally: [rolling a single d8 jokingly] One...
[all laugh]
Lou: 25?
"Brennan: 25 cold damage, hell yeah. Okay, we're going to roll for these devils. Bada boom. Hold on. And these guys need plus… [two 2s and a 10 on the devils’ dice] Whoa, all four swarm devils toast."
Murph: Nice.
Siobhan: Yes.
Ally: Incredible.
Brennan: Incredible. All four swarm devils are gone. Blasted by cold. We're gonna roll for our big boy. Big boy makes the con save. Still takes 10 halved to five. He has resistance.
"Zac: Oh, is it 15? I mean, 25."
"Brennan: Oh, it's 25. Yes, yes, yes. Sorry. Yeah, the big boys have resistance to cold. So that's going to be for him. Yeah, 12. That guy is looking hurt. Okay. Bada boom. That is Pete's turn. Ricky, that's you, baby."
"Zac: Okay, Ricky is going to take out his peasant sword."
[Emily laughs]
"Zac: And look at the siege devil in front of him. And reluctantly, take a swing. Try to take a deep breath and actually swing."
Brennan: Go for it.
Zac: Natural 20.
[everyone cheers]
Brennan: You’re fucking…
Ally: What is going on!?
Brennan: You’re fucking kidding me.
"Siobhan: Zac, these rolls."
Zac: I don't know. Should I show you?
Siobhan: No. We believe.
Emily: I believe you.
"Brennan: That's incredible, you're golden, we believe you."
Ally: I wonder if you put it next to your face.
"Zac holds up a red d20 next to his face, but it’s too blurry to really see it."
"Brennan: Bam. Boom, boom, I love it. Oh my God."
[dramatic orchestral music]
"Zac: I'm just going to do a level one smite, just 'cause that it seems like he's so hurt."
"Brennan: That's going to be with the damage from the sword normally, 8d8 plus… Yeah, that's going to be 8d8 plus 6."
Zac: 45.
Lou: Ooh.
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: What happens to this towering siege devil, who has not yet managed to hit you?"
Zac: Take a deep breath.
"Ricky: Come on, Ricky, it's not that big of a deal."
"Zac: And as I take sort of a baseball swing back with a sword, a thing I'm not used to using, I'm used to using an ax. I look up and just past the siege devil, I see Cody in the distance."
[cast laughs]
Zac: And get a little mad (sword whooshes) and take the swing and cut the thing in half.
"Brennan: His huge torso severs in a flash of light. That siege devil is gone, baby."
"Zac: That's just my first attack though, too."
(Emily screams)
"Brennan: Hell, yeah."
"Zac: And then I'm going to use Ox's movement, which is 120 feet."
Brennan: Dope.
Zac: And I'm going to run all the way up to the Jersey Devil.
"Brennan: Hell, yeah."
"Emily: I was hoping you would, you'll get advantage on attacks."
"Zac: And then I'll take my second attack, and I get an advantage?"
Brennan: You get advantage. He's stunned.
Emily: He's stunned.
Zac: Does an 18 hit?
Emily: I think it does.
"Brennan: Yeah, he doesn't have Shield, 18 is his exact armor class."
"Zac: Oh, yeah. Okay."
Lou: Very good.
Ally: Incredible.
"Zac: So, I used a first-level smite earlier. I'm going to use a second level smite on this guy."
Brennan: Awesome.
"Zac: All right, great. So, how many d8 would that be for this guy?"
"Brennan: For this guy, it's going to be on a second level, it's going to be 5d8."
Zac: 5d8.
"Brennan: 'Cause a normal smite, a first level smite would be 3d8, second level's 4d8, and then 5d8 with the damages. So, 5d8 plus 6."
"Zac: Okay, and I don't get any additional, because he's evil or a devil?"
"Brennan: That's factored in there, from the smite."
"Zac: Okay, fine. Okay, that's 10, 7, 6. 23 plus 6. 29 damage."
Emily: Nice.
"Brennan: Oh, baby! This guy's looking hurt. You run up with Ox. Sofia, you've got them on the ropes, bam, bam, bam! Ricky, you run up and boom! Through the chest with the sword, shattering the window of the cab behind him. (imitates shattering) Amazing!"
Sofia: Questing blade who?
[cast laughs]
Brennan: Iga.
Ricky: It's a really good sword. It's true. It's a really good sword.
"Cody: Awesome combo, Ricky. That was fucking awesome."
Zac: You just see the back of Ricky's head.
Ally: Tense a little bit.
Zac: His shoulders.
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Iga, that's gonna be you."
"Siobhan: So, I have this Disguise Self running. Can I change what the Disguise looks like? Would that take an action?"
Brennan: I think you have to cast—
Siobhan: There’s nothing in the spell that says I can or can’t? I’d have to cast it again?
"Brennan: You have to cast it again, yeah."
"Siobhan: Okay, then I'm just going to fly up into… If I'm above these guys, do I get advantage on attack rolls against them?"
"Brennan: Sure, if you're up flying above them I’ll let you get advantage on them, yeah."
"Siobhan: Great, So I'll fly up 30 feet so I can shoot at the Jersey Devil. Jersey Devil's looking pretty fucked up, right?"
Brennan: He's looking hurt.
Emily: You don't even need to fly to get advantage on him.
"Siobhan: Oh right, he's already—"
"Brennan: He's a big hit point sink. So he might not be close, but he's definitely hurt."
"Siobhan: Okay, in which case I will take out the two guys next to Cody."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: That'd be wonderful.
"[dark, tense music]"
"Siobhan: So the first guy, it's 18 to hit. Does 18 hit?"
"Brennan: 18 hits, yes."
"Siobhan: Great, so that's 15."
[fireworks]
Brennan: Gone.
Murph: Yes.
Siobhan: And then the next one is... a nat 20.
(participants applauding)
Lou: Brrrrah!
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: So, that's just simply so much. 12, 17, 21."
"Brennan: 21, destroyed. [fireworks] Two Eldritch Blasts from a woman who looks like she's hanging from theater wires as she kind of floats through the air."
[Emily laughs]
(Brennan imitates bombings)
"Siobhan: To be fair, a traffic cop that looks like she's hanging from theater wires."
[Emily laughs]
Lou: There it is.
Brennan: There you go.
"Emily: But wait, are you a poorly disguised traffic cop?"
"Siobhan: No, I am a beautifully disguised traffic cop."
"Emily: Okay, okay. [laughs]"
Brennan: Amazing.
"Siobhan: The disguises are great, the magic is purposefully bad looking."
Zac: You look like a character actor from the 90s.
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Cody, that's going to be you baby."
"Murph: Sweet, Cody is going to take the moped through these guys. They don't get an opportunity to attack from moving through them, it's only if they're on top of me to start with, right?"
"Brennan: If you move out of their threatened area, then yes, they get attacks."
Murph: So can I move like… Are you saying this? Can I move like this and not get attacked?
"Brennan: Yes, you can, if you go past. Let me show you the square, Murph, that I'm thinking of. This is the square that you can safely go to. This one, they get swipes on you."
Murph: Got it. Okay. I just want to go around them to get behind the Jersey Devil. 'Cause I think that's the only slot I can fit in.
"Brennan: Cool, so oh, in that case, only one of them is going to get a swipe on you."
"Murph: Okay, I think there's no avoiding that."
"Brennan: Okay. Gonna roll here, misses, just barely misses you."
"Murph: Okay, so I go up behind the devil. I look at Ricky,"
Zac: Oh no.
[cool rock music fading in]
"Murph: I look at Sofie and I nod. I take the Thirsting Blade,"
"Cody: Sword art, combo thirst."
Zac covers his face.
Siobhan: No!
[cast laughs]
Murph: And I go to take a swing. [laughs]
Ally: [air quotes] Combo.
"Emily: I just want you to know that I rolled a trigger roll, every time you do something with a weapon that my husband gave that I thought was going to Ricky."
Murph: Oh no!
[cast laughs]
Ally: Yes!
Murph: I don’t want that!
"Ally: Oh that's good, that's smart of you."
Emily: I’ve passed every time.
Murph: I don’t want that!
"Lou: You have to. Do it, Murph, do it!"
"Brennan: Incredible. Incredible, Cody has no idea, how could Cody know!"
"Murph: Okay, bonus action. Thunderous Smite, call the lightning. Then I am going to… I'll take a swing and see if I hit, I roll with advantage, right?"
Brennan: Yep.
Zac: [rubbing the bridge of his nose] Sword art? God dammit.
Ally: Combo!
"Siobhan: Murph, you're simply too good at this. It’s very disturbing."
[cast laughs]
"Emily: I just really thought Dale meant Ricky to have it, I just really thought."
Murph: 20 to hit.
"Brennan: Yeah, That's going to do it."
Murph: Okay. Great.
"Brennan: Roll your second attack first, if I can ask because… Just roll your second attack to see if you hit on the second one."
"Murph: Okay, another 20 to hit."
"Brennan: Both hit. So I want you to figure out how much damage you're doing this round, if that makes sense."
"Murph: Okay, so I'm going to do another. Okay, so I've just cast, I've done Thunderous Smite. I'm also going to do a second level Divine Smite on the first attack. And then I'm also going to do another first level smite on the second attack."
"Brennan: Okay, so from the Divine Smites alone, we're talking 3d8 and 4d8. So that's 7d8 from just the Divine Smites. Plus the Thunderous Smite you're doing, how much extra damage is that?"
"Murph: That's 2d6. Or is it more damag from smite? 'Cause the second level would be 3d8 but it would be 4d8 because it's a devil, right?"
Brennan: Exactly. So that's where 7d8 is coming from. 'Cause you're doing—
"Murph: Oh, 7d8. Got it."
"Brennan: A first-level smite and… Yeah, so 7d8 for smite all told plus 2d6 from Thunderous Smite plus 4d6. So it's 7d8, plus 6d6 plus 18."
Ally: Amazing.
Brennan: I'm going to tell you—
"Murph: There's only one… Oh wait, you're right, you're right. Sorry, my bad."
[tense Box of Doom music]
"Brennan: Yeah, so it's 7d8 and before you roll, I'm going to tell you something. This creature has 47 hit points left. I want you to roll damage now."
"Murph: Okay, so you said 7d8, plus 6d6, plus 18, cause I do plus 9."
Brennan: Plus 18. Correct.
Siobhan: Jesus.
"Murph: Okay, please."
"Siobhan: Yes, nice!"
[cast laughs]
Siobhan: Freaking nice!
Zac: Nice.
[Murph imitates sword slashing]
"Ally: Whoa, nice."
Lou: Real dumb.
[cast laughs]
Lou: So dumb.
"Cody: Omnislash, meteor strike, sword art, combo! (sword swooshing)"
"Ally: And somehow you, Cody, in the game know that you, the player, got 69."
[cast laughs]
Lou: Somehow.
Brennan: Sofia and Ricky.
Cody: I am the Jersey Devil!
Brennan: You watch Cody decapitate the Jersey Devil.
Emily: Who he summoned.
"Brennan: And he does such an insane dance routine of Omnislash video game moves, a good 60% of which don't hit, because it's mostly about the moves at that point."
Murph imitates cool sword moves.
"Brennan: The Jersey Devil is no more. Cody, you hear Bazathrax go,"
"Bazathrax: Dude, dude, open your shirt, open your shirt, open your shirt, open your shirt!"
[Murph imitates shirt opening]
"Brennan: Ricky and Sofia, you watch flame erupt from the neck of the Jersey Devil and begin to pour into Cody's open chest tattoo."
[metal music]
Siobhan: God.
Brennan: You get a very real sense that Cody Walsh may be becoming the Jersey Devil.
"Cody: So fucking sick! You dream about it every day! And then just devils are real and fucking, you can just absorb them!"
[Brennan laughing]
"Ally: [whispered, face in their hand] God."
Zac: [running his hands through his hair] Can I— aahhhh.
Ricky: Cool.
"Pete: Great, man."
Zac: [stammers] Ricky is just bright red.
[cast laughs]
Brennan: Bright red!
"Zac: Like you know when someone's lifting like they're squatting like 500 pounds, his face just looks like that."
"Brennan: Oh my God. Amazing. Okay, as that has happened, (imitates blowing sound) from within the core of the Jersey Devil's chest, you just hear like"
"Jersey Devil: Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro!"
"Brennan: And it's just fire and then eventually just Juul mist, just vape mist, (imitates mist pouring) pouring out of the open throat. You see more swarm devils, because of the difficult terrain from Erupting Earth. Only four of these guys are gonna be able to attack. Four of them are coming for Sofia."
"Emily: Oh, actually because he died, I do get four hit points."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Sofia, you take seven points of slashing and four points of poison damage. One is going to come for Ricky. That's going to be a hit for five slashing and four poison to Ricky. And then one's coming for Cody, two misses on Cody. Cody's infernal power."
Cody: I am your dark lord now.
"[Zac lets out a long, beleaguered sigh]"
"Brennan: Siege devil comes thundering forward, is going to take a charging... actually is going to move here and it's going to take a charge at Sofia, plus 10, 9 or higher. It's bad. We'll roll in the Box of Doom."
[dramatic Box of Doom music]
"Brennan: Natural two, Sofia avoids the charge."
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: Incredible.
"Emily: I was going to let it happen if it did, I have Shield. (laughing) I was going to let it happen if it did."
Zac: To get the damage?
Emily: Yes.
"Brennan: Just to get the damage. Sofia, that's your turn."
"Emily: Okay, I am out of everything I can do. So I am just going to… Oh, what do I even do here? I think I just…"
Zac: We sh—
Emily: What were you gonna say?
"Zac: I feel like we should at least… So not necessarily you, but I'm worried about leaving JJ so alone. Throwing that out there."
"Emily: Oh, but there are no devils headed that way yet, right?"
"Zac: Right. I mean, not that we know."
"Emily: I think I'm going to go after these two wieners, since I don't hit for much."
Zac: Cool.
Emily: So I'm going to go up to the first one. Does an 18 hit?
"Brennan: Yes, it does."
Emily: Okay. So that's 13.
Brennan: Not down.
Emily: Okay. Gonna try and hit him again. Does a 23 hit? Yes it does.
"Brennan: Yes, it does."
Emily: That's going to be another 13.
Brennan: Gone.
"Emily: Okay, and then I'm going to use my bonus action just to do an unarmed strike against the next one. It misses."
"Brennan: Cool. Copy. Pum pum, pwah! Kill one of the swarm devils. Sofia, it is no longer your turn. JJ, at the end of that—"
"Lou: Let's go, JJ."
Murph: Good luck JJ.
"Lou: C’mon, JJ."
"Brennan: He's got the Enhanced Ability. He's rolling with advantage. He needs to hit 25, he's got plus eight. Is anyone else doing any kind of shenanigans here? Any luck points or other fucking crazy shit like that? No?"
"Ally: I'm thinking about it, I can afford to do a luck."
Siobhan: Can we give our luck points to him?
"Brennan: Yeah, if you want to do a Bend Luck, you can. It's a, roll a d4 for me."
"Ally: Okay,"
Lou: Okay.
Ally: 2.
"Brennan: 2\. Okay, it is a 15 or higher, JJ needs to hit."
"Lou: Let's go, JJ."
"Zac: Come on JJ, come on JJ."
Lou: Come on JJ.
Emily: Come on JJ.
JJ rolls a 10 and an 11.
[cast groaning]
Emily: No!
Brennan: Brutal.
Siobhan: Brutal.
"Brennan: Absolutely brutal. You see… Unless, I will say, luck feat, if anyone has a luck point left, because luck interacts with advantage. Meaning you can have double or triple advantage, because re-rolls do work with luck."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'll spend a luck point."
Ally: Yes.
Brennan: Rock and roll. Okay.
Ally: Please.
"Brennan: One of those dice is going to get rerolled, 15 or higher? Another 10."
Emily: Oh!
Ally: Who else has a luck point?
Siobhan: And I will spend my last goddamn luck point. I'll spend it.
[Brennan laughs]
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: We'll allow it this time. Come on, JJ! 12!"
"Siobhan: Oh, God dammit!"
[cast laughs]
"Lou: What, JJ?"
Zac: Can I use my last luck point?
"Brennan: Yeah, you wanna use your last one? Cool, burn through all of them. Here's the last one. These are some powerfully mediocre rolls. Here comes the last one in front of the board. We have two 10s, an 11 and a 12. That's a 5, baby."
Siobhan: God dammit.
Lou: JJ!
Siobhan: Oh no.
Emily: JJ.
Zac: JJ is sweating.
"Siobhan: JJ, you shit the bed."
"Lou: At this point, what more can we do for him!"
[cast laughs]
Brennan: Brutal.
Emily: This is true. This is true.
"Lou: We gave you everything, JJ."
Zac: This is the worst day of Ricky's life.
"Brennan: You watch the complex ending of the spell fritz out. JJ yells back,"
JJ: I got it! I know what I did wrong. I just made a mistake earlier. I can go back and fix it again.
"Iga: You’re fine JJ, just do it. Don't tell us, just do it."
"Brennan: However, I will say this, of the two sort of solutions to this combat, Cody finishes absorbing the might of the Jersey Devil. I will need an Intimidate check with advantage here from Cody, if you would be so kind."
"Murph: Sweet, I have proficiency."
"Ally: Hell, yeah."
Murph: [claps] 26.
"[intense, quick, dark music]"
"Brennan: [laughs] Cody, you finish ingesting the power of the Jersey Devil and you gleam with infernal light. The Questing Blade rippling with black and orange flames. You turn and the Jersey devils here behold you. Even though you're living in Queens these days, you were born in Jersey City. They look at you. What do you say to the devils here assembled?"
[dramatic pause]
"Cody: What's up, guys? I am the new Dark Lord of New Jersey. I am Cody, the Jersey Devil. I have defeated your master and I am the new Dark Lord. I will call upon you one day and we will take back the Queens Center Mall. But that is not today. You guys need to fuck off for now and fucking relax and go back to your own malls in New Jersey, which has a shitton of malls."
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: The devils here all… Look, you guys see an army of devils extending all the way off to the New Jersey turnpike. And the giant siege devil looming over Cody, gets to one knee and bows and the swarm devils bow and the entire highway of devils bows to Cody Walsh."
Zac and Ally both are rubbing the bridges of their noses. Siobhan is rubbing her temples instead.
Ally: Oh my God.
Cody: There are many parking lots of many different strip malls and regular malls that need you. Go.
Brennan: One of the great siege devils—
"Cody: Take shopping carts and ram them into curbs, while your friends are inside."
"Brennan: One of them goes like,"
"Devil: Hell yeah, dude, we're going to do the old school, 'Jackass' style, baby, CKY, dude!"
Cody: Fucking hilarious.
"Brennan: You see one of the siege devils goes up and bellows out, says,"
"Siege Devil: Devils of New Jersey, you heard the word of the one who destroyed our master. Let's go to fucking AC, anyway bro, New York fucking sucks! We’re going to Atlantic city, baby, woo, get wet."
Brennan: And you see the devils—
Ricky: Get wet?
"Sofia: Why do they keep saying that? We need to ask Cody after this, what that means."
"Brennan: You see that as they begin to leave, a bunch of swarm devils, come over and go,"
"Swarm Devils: Yeah. Yeah. My lord, fuck, yeah. Do you think I can borrow like $20, just for the fucking craps to AC?"
"Cody: I am your dark lord, [yelling] get the fuck out of here!"
Swarm Devil: [panicked indistinct yelling]
"Brennan: You see that the siege devil who bellowed out to the other devilkind to heed your warning, looks at you from the toll booth, looks at New York City behind you, gives you a very solemn the shocker and then walks off—"
[Murph laughs]
Brennan: Walks off into New Jersey. What's going on with our—
"Ally: This is such a side note, but there was a car that parks in my neighborhood that it's only sticker is a the shocker. And I cannot figure them out, sorry."
"Murph: I think until this moment, everything was complete fantasy for Cody of all this. When that devil threw up the shocker, Cody is shook, because he's realizing he's on the same side as these bros."
[cast laughs]
"Ally: Yes, yes."
Cody: The fuck am I becoming?
Brennan: [laughs] What's going on with our other heroes of New York that watched this unfold?
"Ally: I mean, I go pat Cody on the back, like,"
"Pete: Great job, man. You did such a freaking good job. It was great."
"Cody: I gotta be honest. I couldn't have done it without Sofie saving my ass. But then also fucking Ricky, you like took that hit for me. So that was fucking cool. And Kingston healed me. That was cool. And Madam Anastasia—"
Pete: Do you think that was what happened?
[Emily laughing]
"Pete: Cody, Cody, no, don't worry."
"Iga: No Cody, we were all there."
Cody: Cool.
"Iga: Yeah, we saw it."
"Cody: Cool, cool. So just, yeah. Go team."
"Pete: Yeah, definitely man."
"Ricky: Sofia, mind if I, can we sidebar, real fast, Sofia?"
"Sofia: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely, we’ll be right back. [quietly] Yeah, Ricky, what’s up?"
"Ricky: So, I'm kind of going through something a little bit unnatural for me right now. Where it’s like, I really…"
Cody is swinging his sword around again.
Ricky: I could never have expected that to happen.
"Sofia: I know, I know."
Ricky: And to continue to happen.
Ongoing Cody sword swinging.
"Ricky: And I appreciate you bringing the Questing Blade back, 'cause I kinda missed it to be honest and I was glad that Dale had it."
"Sofia: I know, I thought it was for you, I really thought it was for you."
"Ricky: Yeah, I just had to say that to somebody, 'cause it's—"
Sofia: You wanna just like… I don't mind… Do you want to just scream really loud? 'Cause I can cast Silence.
"Ricky: Yeah, can you go ahead and cast Silence on me?"
Emily: I cast Silence.
Zac screams silently.
[cast laughs]
"Zac finishes his scream, then mouths that he’s okay and gives Sofia a thumbs up."
"Emily: Okay, I dispel it."
[Brennan is truly losing it]
Ricky: Thank you. Thank you.
"Sofia: Yeah, of course."
Ricky: I think that helps a lot.
Sofia: It helps me sometimes. I thought it might help you.
Brennan: Oh my God.
Ricky: Thank you. Are you okay by the way?
"Sofia: I'm fine. I'm in a better place than you are. I think the fact that he admitted a couple of things at the end is soothing to me. I'm still mad that you didn't get the Questing Blade, but I'm hopeful about the young pup."
"Ricky: Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too. He seems like… a good guy."
[Murph laughing]
Emily: I cast Silence again and then we both...
Zac and Emily both scream silently. Sofia is clearly saying “fuck” over and over again.
"Brennan: Incredible. Amazing, you guys leave from here having rented this place. In the minute or two that you guys are kind of putting things back together, Kingston leaves that note on the Tesla. JJ finishes getting the spellwork up here now. I mean like getting it up in three rounds, is literally getting it up in like 18 seconds. You know what I mean? So he like, having a minute to do it. The runes go up, he turns around and says,"
"JJ: Okay, I think that's done."
"Brennan: And you see something connect and boom. The runes start pulsating. And a moment later, completely soaking wet, sort of coughing and sputtering, Esther flies in with her silver baseball bat."
Esther: [coughs] Okay. We're good. We are all good. We are taken care of.
Siobhan: I pull a pair of warm socks out of my large woven bag and hand them to Esther.
"Esther: Oh my god, Madam—"
"Iga: It’s just always important to have a little pair of extra dry socks in New York City, because this city sometimes you need a pair of dry socks. You know what I mean?"
"Esther: I appreciate that so, so much. Truly thank you."
Zac: I use Destroy Water on Esther.
"Brennan: [imitates water splashing] She’s dried off, she goes,"
"Esther: Hun, thank you so much."
Ricky: You got it.
Iga: That also works.
Brennan: She looks at you—
"Ricky: Sorry, she can use the socks, too, they seem nice."
"Brennan: She does put the socks on, but she looks up at you, Ricky, and goes,"
"Esther: Yeah, thank you so much for that, hun."
Brennan: And absentmindedly looks at your forehead and touches a vein on your forehead.
Zac: It's like that. [mimes it pulsing]
"Brennan: Yeah, like pum, pum, pum. She's like,"
"Esther: Hey, hun, everything good?"
"Ricky: Yeah, um, things are great. The Questing Blade came back and…"
Esther’s mouth drops open in shock.
"Ricky: ...funny enough, our new friend, Cody, it went to him. It went to Cody. I just had a very similar conversation to this, but you should know about this. Cody is over there and it looks different. It looks different than the ax that I had."
(sword swooshes)
Ricky: He's swinging it. He's kinda cutting those cars over there.
[car crunching noises]
"Ally: I think I'm over there Minor Illusioning like apples and oranges for you to slice. We’re just like bro-ing out, like,"
"Pete: Aww, dude! Aww, dude!"
Cody: Fucking hell yeah! Fucking Limit Break!
"Brennan: Yeah, you see Esther looks over and says,"
"Esther: Thank you, stop. Thank you, stop! Thank you, stop that. Yeah, for sure, stop."
Cody: [still swinging] Yes! Yes!
"Brennan: You see two bats fly in out of the nighttime sky. [imitates bat flying] Ana and Amelia arrive as well, Esther looks over, JJ is standing… You guys can see actually in the roll20, the incredible elaborate ward that JJ has put up. Esther goes over and says,"
"Esther: Incredible, incredible, incredible, wonderful."
"Brennan: JJ goes,"
"JJ: Woo! Would certainly have been killed many times over, if these guys had not stopped the onslaught of devils."
"[gentle, dreamy music]"
"Brennan: Ana and Amelia begin to cast Mending on all the cars that got damaged or ruined. Kingston, I think Remote Access probably helps like drive some of these cars back from where they got—"
"Lou: Put everything back in place, yeah."
"Brennan: You guys do your Unsleeping City cleanup crew here. As you hear the approach of like, sirens and other people coming to see why the Holland Tunnel got shut down. [faint sirens] Esther looks over at Kingston and Pete and she also looks at you, Ricky and says,"
"Esther: Yeah, I got you, hun. Good. Hey, hey, you see that?"
"Brennan: She takes your face in her hands, and goes,"
"Esther: I love you. That's bullshit. I don't know why that's going on, but I'm saying that as a wizard, I think something fucked up happened, okay?"
"Ricky: Okay. Well, I love you too. And, um, I, you know— I, and between you and me, I'm having a bit of a moment, I would say."
"Esther: Yeah, I hear you. It's okay."
Ricky: And I don't know. I might run home.
"Esther: Do you want to just… We might have a little like debriefing here, but if you want to just run home, that's totally fine. Why don't we do a debriefing tomorrow morning? It's late. People have been busy. If you want to take a run home, go ahead and take a run home, sweetie."
"Ricky: I don't want to miss anything, but I definitely want to run home."
[Ally and Emily laughing]
"Esther: Honestly, we're going to be another few minutes here. Do you want to just run to the Gramercy Occult Society and we'll meet you there?"
"Ricky: Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. I love you. Thank you for… I mean, I want to hear about the water part later, but yeah."
Zac mimes zooming off.
"Brennan: [laughs] Ricky takes off, Esther comes with Amelia and checks on you, Sofia. Comes and puts a hand on your arm sort of like squeezes your bicep and goes like,"
"Esther: Hey, how's Ricky doing? He looks like he's not doing great right now."
"Sofia: Yeah, no, he's not. I feel like it's my fault, because Dale gave the Questing Blade back and I pulled it out of my pocket saying, ""Hey, Ricky, I think Dale wanted you to have this."" Then it made this really big arcane show about choosing Cody instead of Ricky."
[cast laughs]
Zac mimes furious running.
"Sofia: And then to add insult to injury, Cody named it, the Thirsting Blade, because it thirsts for blood, then absorbed the power of a devil, took the final strike on the big bad guy, absorbed its power, became the Jersey Devil. So the Questing Blade, which Ricky once loved, is now in the hands of the newly anointed Jersey Devil, who's calling it the Thirsting Blade."
"Brennan: Esther, her hands shake in front of her. And she's like,"
"Esther: Oh, oh, no. I literally was never able to imagine what could get under Ricky's skin. And it's like going from thinking that a thing was impossible to knowing what would perfectly, completely shatter my darling love. Okay, this is so… The Questing Blade came back, how are you, Sofia? Are you doing okay?"
Sofia: [stammers a little] Maybe now's not the time.
"Esther: Okay, yeah, I hear you. Stay—"
Sofia: I'm fine. Let's focus on Ricky.
Esther: Gotcha.
"Brennan: You guys finish the cleanup crew here and people go home for the night. You guys are taking care of it. You've saved the city yet again. JJ is looking at Ana and Amelia being like,"
"JJ: Can you, the fucking army of devils? This is fucking nuts! This is crazy!"
"Brennan: JJ comes over to you, Cody, and it's like,"
"JJ: Dude, those combo moves were out of control, man!"
"Cody: Thanks, thanks. Yeah, I've been actually studying sword fighting for a while, but it took until… I would really recommend selling your soul to a devil, just kind of any devil. 'Cause my devil's not even particularly good, but gave me a lot of powers and then that combined with sort of just years of practice in my backyard, just like freaking out on soda bottles and stuff. And yeah, that's kinda where I'm at."
"Brennan: You see, JJ—"
Cody: Your math stuff was awesome. That was like.
"JJ: Dude, I know I'm not at your level yet, but I'm working on it. It's all very theoretical and learning where the intersections of science and magic and mathematics, all sort of interplay is a fucking trip man, but it's super cool."
"Cody: No, that's, dude, parties need wizards and then they need warriors. So you might not be able to do what I can fucking do, but I can't do what you can fucking do, if you know what I mean."
"JJ: Holy, shit, man. I super appreciate that. Do you have your Switch on you?"
"Cody: I actually kind of feel like… Okay, I'm sort of a PS4 guy."
[Brennan laughs]
Cody: And also a PC guy.
"Brennan: You guys dive fully into that. You see that, bum, bum, bum. Cool. Texts go out as people go home that night, texts go out to people basically being like, “hey, we should debrief about last night, but also sort of talk over next steps, what's going on.”"
"Brennan: Esther texts you, Sofia, and is basically like,"
"Esther: Better for us to meet and talk at the monastery, or better for us to do Gramercy Occult Society?"
"Emily: Can I do some kind of Perception check of what I think? I'm worried about Tony, but I'm also worried about taking books out of the monastery. So can I do a perception check about, which I feel is a bigger threat?"
Brennan: I’d ask for Insight actually.
"Emily: Okay, so 10."
"Brennan: I think Sofia is as conflicted as you right now. I think that it's just like… Because obviously taking the sacred texts out of the monastery feels a little sacrilegious, but—"
"Emily: Yeah. I think Tony is an easier thing to keep an eye on, than worrying about removing texts from the monastery. So I'm going to say,"
"Sofia: Yeah, let's do monastery."
"Brennan: Hell, yeah. The next day—"
"Emily: Oh, that means everyone's going to come to Staten Island!"
Brennan: Oh my God.
Siobhan: Oh boy.
"Emily: Oh my gosh. I go around, I'm picking up trash trying to make it look as nice as possible. I do like Belle in the Beauty and the Beast for Staten Island."
"Brennan: Amaz— Just throughout all the Staten Island getting everything perfectly ready for people. When Sofia approaches Esther saying, “Hey, we probably do the monastery."" Esther says,"
"Esther: God, it makes perfect sense. We can approach the monastery. We'll put out a formal invitation."
"Brennan: And Esther hits up a… Esther turns her head to Ricky next to her on the sofa and is like,"
"Esther: You good for a meeting in two days, sweetie? Can you get that time off of helping hands? Is that okay?"
"Ricky: Yeah, let me double check. I think I should be okay."
Esther: Cool.
"Brennan: She looks at you and says,"
"Esther: Cool, good, good, good."
"Brennan: She also texts Madam Anastasia, or rather she sends a formal invite to Madam Anastasia and underneath it puts,"
"Esther: This will also serve as a time for the return of your chest to you, to make the most use of your time and convenience."
Siobhan: [Iga voice] A bribe to go to the Staten Island. Well.
[Emily laughing]
"Siobhan: [Iga voice] It had to happen sometime, I guess."
Ally: You've never been to Staten Island in your whole life?
"Siobhan: [Iga voice] I have been on the ferry, you have family visits, you take the ferry, it's free. You see the island, you see Ellis Island, you turn around, you get back on the next ferry back. You do the exact same trip. That's what Staten Island does to you. And that was enough."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Emily: I'm just going around Staten Island. I'm going into every single store, telling them to put on their best show. I mean,"
Sofia: There's visitors coming. There's visitors coming. Put out the welcome mats!
"Brennan: [laughs] So, two days later and you see… So, Madam Anastasia, you get that invitation. Ricky, you're going to make time to go be there and do that. Sofia, you're obviously like hosting and getting Staten Island as ready as possible. And Kingston and Pete, you get specific formal invitations, accompanied by texts from Esther, being like,"
"Esther: LOL about the formal invitation. There's magical reasons for us doing that. You're both Voxes. We want to make the magical laws of the city happy. Hope you can both make it, love, Esther."
"Brennan: But you do get these formal magical things that get dropped off by pigeons like big signed parchment, things being like, ""A council of the Gramercy Occult Society to be held at the Monastery of the Midnight Sun. Staten Island, altitude 2,500 feet, above Spaghetti's Bakery.” And Esther asks you and says,"
"Esther: Hey, this is going to be kind of a real deal meeting of the minds. Anyone from the city you guys think should come, feel free to go ahead and invite."
"Brennan: And I think Sofie gets one of those as well, of like if there's anyone outside your order that you think should come, feel free to go ahead and invite them."
"Emily: Yeah, I mean, obviously I send a group text to everyone here to come. Yeah, do you guys have anyone else that you want to invite? It's a big island, we can host a lot of people. And I know a lot of the business owners are really excited."
(Brennan laughs)
Murph: Maybe Willy.
Siobhan: I like Willy. Willy is our neighbor.
Zac: Great.
"Ally: Willy and Em? I would love to get a hold of Nod at some point and be able to talk, but."
"Lou: I mean, that would be my ideal."
"Brennan: Cool, who do you guys specifically reach out to and how before the meeting?"
Ally: How do I contact Nod? How was I getting in contact with them?
Brennan: You just are normally able to reach out to them and speak pretty easily actually.
Ally: I'd like to do that and invite them to this thing.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Arcana check.
"Ally: Okay. Oh, that's only an 11."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: It's not working. Sometimes Nod is busy or other shit comes up. You could always try going to a more dreamlike place. It also occurs to Pete in this moment, that you haven't needed to contact Nod for awhile for anything, you've been kind of just doing your Vox Phantasma thing of bringing dream life in the city. It probably also occurs to Pete, that his consciousness was already pretty altered during the times that he was contacting Nod the most frequently."
Ally: Yeah. Interesting. [rolls a sobriety die] We’re good.
[Emily and Brennan laugh]
Ally: I think I'm gonna meditate. I'm gonna try to meditate.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: I've been trying to meditate.
Brennan: Give me like a Religion check.
Ally: Let me see here. (whistling) That's only a nine. This damn chimes keeps going off. I can't meditate.
"Brennan: You’re like in your mind, you are not in Nod physically right now. That's a bigger deal to go to Nod in person, to like ride the L all the way to the Nod station. But you're in Nod just in your mind and your liminal space, because you travel there every night in your real dreams. There's something there at the edge, that you feel like you could come back to when you're actually asleep. But you see something, you think you might see where Nod is."
Ally: Okay. Okay.
[dreamlike piano music]
"Brennan: That night when you go to sleep, you're in Nod, again you're not here physically, you're here just in your dream state. You're dreaming. You're here in the world of dreams. Your body is asleep somewhere in the waking world. Bright sparkling lights, you see that there are all of these ghost fleet leaves, made almost of like incense smoke that blow through Nod during the autumn swirling up, all the stars overhead. Of course, New York with starlight, never happens in the waking world, but here in the dreaming sky is rich with stars. Go ahead and give me a Perception check."
Ally: Okay. That is a [scoffs] 9.
"Brennan: You can't tell why, but it's not as bright here right now. You're looking around the buildings. And normally the buildings are alive with lights. But you know that the lights are on in places where people are dreaming and you're looking around and just seeing that there aren't a lot of dreaming people in the city. I mean, there's plenty. There's lots, right? You're looking around and see millions of people, But God, do you think these buildings used to be brighter? And you're seeing rooms and apartments here in Nod that are dark. You know, there are dark apartments in Nod all the time. People are out of town, people aren't home. They're awake during the night. So they're not at home dreaming. Nod is always sort of purpley and misty and swirling in indigo. You feel a rising in your stomach, almost in that way of like a car going over a bump in the road or something like that. And you feel a wash of something around you of raw Umbra."
Ally: Fuck.
"Brennan: One or two little lights go out, not big, just one or two twinkle out. You look behind you, behind you is Times Square in Nod. Which is bright, colorful, even more bright and colorful in the dream world than it is anywhere else. You haven't fucked around with Times Square in a while. Because Times Square is where everything fucking went down three years ago. And you know that the Paragon doorway is closed and sealed. It's safe. You've taken care of that. You've been doing your thing, but there is… You sense something out there in Times Square."
Ally: Hmm… Can I try something?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: So this Umbra around me, right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
Ally: That I've been seeing. Do I recognize it from like other places? Like this is what I've just been seeing?
"Brennan: Yeah, it's hard. You realize it's always there. It's like how you can't really see humidity in the air. Unless someone shows you a picture of like, ""Here's on a clear day and here's on..."" And you go, ""Oh shit, there is a big difference."" But you'd never would look for it. That's sort of what Umbra is here. Yeah."
"Ally: Can I just start saying out loud things like,"
"Pete: Fuck all the people here. I fucking— Honestly, fuck the party, these New Yorkers. Kingston needs to leave, he's never seen Europe. What a fucking dumb guy."
[Brennan laughs]
Ally: Can I just start talking shit on New York?
Brennan: Give me a Deception roll.
"Ally: Okay, oh, I have good Deception, I was a drug dealer. That's 20, not nat."
"Brennan: Cool, you start saying that. You begin to see a thread of Umbra going towards Times Square kind of in that weird bridgie way. Vein is the wrong word, it's more like how currents exist in the ocean. There's a current of Umbra, (imitates current) moving towards Times Square. And you feel somewhat invisible. Here's the thing. And I'm going to ask Pete for this lie to work like a lot of good lies. Part of you has to believe it. Is Pete willing to let himself get to a point of feeling a little bit of isolation in this moment to make the lie convincing?"
"Ally: I mean, he's definitely saying all of this stuff knowing he doesn't believe it. But I do believe he is pretty isolated."
"Brennan: If Pete feels a twang of isolation, then the lie will work, but you have to feel the real feeling of loneliness."
"Ally: Yeah, I think he does. I think he definitely has access to that feeling."
"Brennan: Okay, cool. That is a trigger for Pete."
Ally: Yeah. 4.
Brennan: Cool. Great.
Emily: Yes.
"Brennan: You move forward, as you say that you feel that real thing of you're like, ""I'm living in a fucking attic in Astoria."" You know that Priya didn't treat you correctly. And you know, the kindness that Sofia and Kingston and Ricky and everybody has extended to you. You know that kindness is incredibly real. And the realness of that kindness makes it hurt even more that these people are not going to lie down in bed with you to keep you warm at night for the rest of your life. They're not going to be there by your side at every moment they are going to have their own needs and their own lives. And for as awful as Priya was to you, as much as things were never going to work out with Rowan, you weren't alone. And that when you feel isolated and you feel this feeling of like so sad, so alone, cold. And cold is a measurement of distance almost. You're further away. The more farther away things move from each other, the colder they get, down to the level of electrons, right? The air is moving less. Things are less agitated when they're further apart and colder and more distant. And as you hear that, something's wrong with the colorful signs. You're in Times Square and you look and see through the colorful signs and all of these things are billboards of signs and products that don't exist, all the signs in Times Square Nod are for companies that people in the city dream of starting. So there's all these dreams of people that are trying to make it in music and haven't made it yet and trying to sell their movie and be an action star and this person, that person. So it's an incredible neon thing of all the dreams and ideas and innovations of people and what they want to do with their lives. There is an area as you look, and at first you think something's wrong with your eyes because you're looking at some of the signs and they are absent of color. And then you realize that you are seeing the absence of color in the silhouette of a figure wearing a suit."
[air whooshing ominously]
Ally: It's that person.
"[tense, dreamlike music]"
"Brennan: The way I would describe it is picture if… Like, you know when someone is invisible you're able to see through them. Picture if someone was invisible and you could see through them but everything that you were seeing through them to see was [snaps] robbed of its color. So there's no features to this thing. There's no outline. It's just the shape of something human like with the things behind it, robbed of color."
Ally: Can I cast Detect Thoughts on it?
Brennan: Static.
Ally: [thinking] Okay...
"Brennan: You see the figure turn to you. It probably— Here's the thing, it doesn't look… You can't tell how far away this thing is because it isn't a figure. It's just things in the distance not having the color they would normally have, right? So it's like, where is this thing in relation to me? But in terms of the size of something, it would make sense if something was not close but not far away, maybe something like… Like if a person was in the middle distance between you and signs behind it, turns, you hear a voice coming out of the speaker function of your phone. Like your phone is on speaker mode. A voice of a guy that you went to high school with speaks to you out of the phone and goes,"
"Voice: [through a tinny speaker] Wow, look at all these dreams."
"Brennan: The head of the figure turns and again, there's no face but the head turns in such a way that you know it is oriented towards you and just goes,"
Voice: Most of these will never come true. I suppose hope is kind of painful that way.
Brennan: Two of the signs blink out.
[brief glitchy music]
"Ally: Was that the invisible person that said the second part, most of these will never come true?"
Brennan: The invisible person—
"Ally: Hasn't spoken, it was just the—"
"Brennan: Hasn't spoken, it's a voice coming out of your phone but you're not sure. There is no person there. And so, maybe this person doesn't talk from a place because it is nowhere."
"Ally: Okay, do I get the sense that… Like when I was trying to be really negative or when I was embracing the isolation that I feel, do I get the sense that the Umbra could take me over or that I was feeding some sort of loop with it?"
"Brennan: Yes, It felt like that feeling of emptiness, that isolation, more powerfully attached you to the Umbra."
"Ally: Okay, I just sprint towards the invisible person."
"Brennan: Cool, you sprint towards them. Make a Wisdom saving throw for me, DC-"
Ally: Nat 20.
Emily: Yes! Yes!
Ally: Nat 20.
Ally lifts up a notebook with their d20 on it to show the camera.
Emily: Yes!
Zac: Oh my God.
Brennan: Fuck you! Fuck you!
[cast laughs]
Emily: Yes. Yes.
Murph: Oh my God.
Siobhan: I love it when Ally ruins Brennan’s plan.
Ally: I cast Banishment on them.
"Brennan: Here's the thing, you cast Banishment on them. Pete, on a nat 20, it fucking works. Something you reach out and immediately know. Ally, I'm going to be real with you. If you had rolled a 19, you'd be fucking dead."
Ally’s jaw drops.
"Brennan: What you just did— When you reach out to banish this thing, it flinches, in the way that a great white shark flinches when punched in the nose, you just did the brave… Pete realizes, “I just did the bravest thing I've ever done.” This thing is so vast. The size of it, it is bigger than Nod, bigger than New York, bigger than anything. Its form is formless. Its mass is massless. It extends from here into the deep dark depths of the dreaming forever, and you running to it would have put you into its center and you would have joined your friends, Josefina Gatsby and Hans in the far reaches of the dreaming and your last memories would be [snaps] gone from that museum, baby. That's it. On a nat 20, like punching a shark in the nose, like doing something that fucking crazy. This thing vanishes from Nod, voom. And you hear a scream cry out from the top of the Empire State Building."
[faint child’s scream]
"Ally: I look, can I see anything?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can fly in the dream realm, no problem."
"Ally: Oh, yeah. Right."
"Brennan: Again, the equivalent of banishing— [laughs]"
[cast laughs]
Ally: Did I just ruin your whole game?
"Brennan: Oh, for everyone at home, this is the last episode we're shooting before I have a five-day break. Which is the only reason I'm ruining my whole campaign right now."
[Emily laughs]
Ally covers their face in shock.
"Brennan: Pete, you… Yeah, you have that… I don't know. It's the thing of like, ""Oh, I did a skate trick. Oh God, I didn't realize I was doing it from one skyscraper to another."" Yes, that was an ollie. But I didn't realize that I was doing—"
[Ally laughing]
"Brennan: I didn’t realize what the stakes were in that moment, right? You, boom. And you think maybe partially, because of the ill-advisedness, whatever this entity is there is some calculation on it's part of like… You’re like, “Okay, I so believed that was going to work that perhaps whatever the fuck…” Even “entity” is too humanizing of a word for what that thing was. And it's gone for the moment, it's gone from Nod. You've done your job as the Vox Phantasma. And as you fly to the top of the Empire State Building you see, withered, emaciated and hurt is the gray orphan, is Nod. Looks up, something has been feeding on Nod and you think you know what it was."
"[somber, gentle piano music]"
Ally: I grab Nod.
"Brennan: You grab them, they look up and go,"
"Nod: I keep saying it, but I knew I choose— I knew I choose right, right, right. [quiet gasp]"
"Brennan: And they collapse and start breathing. And your presence begins to fill them with a multi-colored phantasmagoria of healing light. The reason you haven't heard from Nod is it was being devoured. It being the place and them being the person, were both being devoured by whatever that thing was. You look back down at Times Square, and for a moment you're holding Nod. You can tell that they're healing. You're holding them in your arms. They are smiling and weeping these jet black tears, like you saw them weep on the very first day you saw them. You look down Times Square, the signs that were turned off, turn back on but they don't turn on with color again. [energy activating] “Gladiator, coming to a campus near you.” You wake up. [pauses] [laughs] Fucking wild!"
[cast laughs]
Brennan: Woo baby!
Ally: Wow.
"Brennan: Okay, I'm going to say that's what Pete's mind is on. But it's the day of the meeting. So, you, hey, you did your job, you found Nod. But of course Nod can't come to the waking world anyway, but you're awake on the day of the meeting. For everybody else, I know it's crazy. But after all—"
Zac: You just throw up.
[cast laughs]
Ally: Truly.
"Brennan: Oh my fucking god. Kingston, do you reach out to anyone to come to… Does Kingston, Sofia, Ricky, Cody, or Iga reach out to anybody to invite them to the meeting?"
"Zac: I don't think, I don’t think I actually know Willy that well to invite him to this meeting. But that was the only person I could think of that was outside of, an ally that we've talked about."
"Lou: Happy to do it, unless people… Maybe this is crazy."
Zac: Maybe it's unnecessary.
"Lou: Yeah. I mean, I'll invite Willy, is it… I'm not going to invite… I just had the thought and I'll just say it in the group chat and everyone could just thumbs up or thumbs down. Will Santa Claus be helpful in this situation? Or are we leaving him out of this?"
Zac: You mean Wally?
"Lou: Oh, Santa Claus is gone. Wally is Santa Claus now."
Siobhan: Wally is Santa Claus.
"Emily: I think that may be, if you feel excited about having Santa Claus, AKA Wally there that absolutely I'm on board. There is something about him that I want to just keep him innocent."
Zac: Did he date your mom or did he not?
Emily: Did he date my mom?
"Brennan: I think we fully redlined that because it was a joke at the end of the finale. And then we all thought about it for a day and went, that's so disturbing and upsetting. Let's not have that happen."
"Lou: Great, we'll leave Wally innocent. And I'll text Willy and see if he wants to come. I'll forward him the same invitation that was sent to me. And if he'd like to attend, he's more than welcomed."
"Brennan: Yeah, Willy gets back in touch with you and is like,"
Willy: I would love to attend. What are we going to see you at the poker game? You get back together with Liz and now...
"Kingston: All right, I'm making a conscious choice to spend time with a woman I find to be near perfection."
[Emily laughs]
"Kingston: So I think, if I have a choice between poker and perfection, I'll pick perfection 10 out of 10 times."
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Willy: Oh, of course."
"Brennan: He says,"
Willy: I say these things because I miss you.
"Kingston: Well, she's working a lot right now. So who knows maybe I'll be able to sneak over one Thursday night. We'll see. We'll see."
"Brennan: Wonderful. Cool, so Willy is on his way there as well. And Sofie, anyone from you?"
Emily: I actually want to use the time to maybe ask Tony something.
Brennan: Sure. Yeah. So it's the morning of the meeting. Yeah.
"Emily: Yeah. I think I want to… I'll go in on my phone, pretending I'm finishing up a conversation, just be talking really glowing about Pete. Just being like,"
"Sofia: Oh yeah, yeah. Then he casts haste on a Dalmatian, and then Cone of Cold on a bunch of devils. What a kid that. Oh, sorry, I'm going into a meeting, bye. [to Tony] Sorry, I was talking about Pete. Hey?"
"Tony: Yeah, you all right. Yeah, no worries."
"Sofia: Yeah, no, sorry. That's rude of me. I should’ve put my phone away sooner. Anyways, I just had a real quick question for you."
"Tony: Yeah, yeah, shoot. What is it? What do you need help with?"
"Sofia: I just wanted to know a little more about what happened in San Francisco. Obviously nothing that you don't want to tell but I was curious if you all had a Vox Populi or Vox Phantasma there? I don't know enough about this kind of stuff, to know if that will be normal."
"Brennan: He shakes his head and says,"
"Tony: No, there's an unseen world within San Francisco. As there is within most cities, but no, it's… Yeah, magic's different depending on where you go, New York is unique, unique New York, right?"
Sofia: Yeah. That rolled off the tongue for you. Are you a theater kid?
"Tony: Nah, you know, surprisingly, I didn't get into much theater. I mostly was getting my ass kicked. But I'll tell you what the… No, San Francisco's got a magic all its own. And I have family out there so I wanted to see them. And I also wanted the Order that… You know, there was a period of time in American history where they were going to have… They got the Statue of Liberty out here in New York. And in San Francisco they wanted to build a complimentary statute to it called the Statue of Responsibility. It's a interesting piece of history. You can look it up. I think people forget that sometimes and I wonder what the country would be like if we had had both statues kind of watching out for us on either coast because it's not always about what you want to do, sometimes it's about your responsibilities."
"Sofia: Yeah, I see. Oh, you know, as a fellow, a monk of the order dealing with the material world and really ingrained in that kind of stuff, I totally agree. Responsibility is really important. It's really important."
"Tony: Yeah. You know that's the mantra, right? It is what it is and—"
"Sofia: Yeah, it is what it is. Absolutely, I think that's a great mantra. [purses her lips]"
"Brennan: (laughs) You see, Tony looks at you and says,"
"Tony: In any case, no there's no Vox Populi, Vox Phantasma there. New York is special in terms of its relationship to the cycle of waking and dreaming. It has a unique relationship to sleep, to the world of dreaming. But there's plenty of other realms to be attached to, plenty of other sources of magic out there and other places."
"Sofia: Okay, I was just curious. 'Cause I know that we have a real reciprocal relationship with magic and the material. We have a good relationship between, maybe liberty and responsibility here. And so I was curious."
"Tony: Yeah, it's not really magic what we do."
"Sofia: No, it's not."
"Tony: The power of your strength, your ki, your soul. Ki is literally life force. It's not supernatural, it's the most natural, right? And even people that cast spells with the best of intentions can sometimes be meddling in forces that they don't fully understand. You know what I mean? And I'm not gonna lie to you. Sofia, look, I think, you know that I'm an old school guy. I feel old school kind of way about things. The last thing I want to do is be an old dog trying to learn new tricks. And I don't want to be that asshole that comes back home and tries to tell people the way to do things or whatever. Look, hey, you crack the riddle, right? Turns out Dale was right, the chosen one was a real thing, right? So I'm not going to tell you your business. What I will say is that it's a slippery slope. It's a slippery slope, because of course Haste is going to be useful. Of course, it's going to be useful for someone to summon some kind of spirit, do something quick. So you let it slide, right? And that's a little more, it's a creature from the dream realm is something crossing over, is something else. Eventually the line gets drawn somewhere and if it doesn't, well, what the hell happens then, right?"
"Sofia: Yeah, I definitely agree that it's a delicate situation and that responsibility is important. I do hope that you will keep an open mind because I do believe an old dog can learn new tricks."
"Tony: Hey, I'll do my best, I'm pretty old. [laughs]"
"Sofia: Okay, yeah. All right. Cool."
"Emily: And I think that I feel okay with that conversation, kind of feel like I suss him out a little more. I was considering spying on him. Obviously, I don't say this out loud, but I think I'm going to just keep it as is."
"Brennan: Cool, the meeting comes. So Esther arrives with JJ in tow because Ana and Amelia are asleep. It's the daytime. So she arrives looking great. They're with Ricky. Iga, you get there. You guys all meet up at the ferry. You see Willy walking up. [imitates thudding] Give me a Perception check."
Lou: You got it. That's going to be 18.
Brennan: Willy is moving a little bit slower than normal.
Lou: Can I tell why or is there… Can I tell why without asking?
Brennan: Give me a Medicine check.
Lou: I'd love to. That's going to be a 28.
"Brennan: Willy is a golem. He is animated by a divine force and it looks like that maybe his connection to that divine force is a little bit weaker. A little bit lessened. It looks like he's straining more to move his own bulk but he looks up at you and you can tell he's masking it. He just goes,"
"Willy: Kingston Brown from uptown, there’s my buddy."
"Kingston: Oh, what’s up, Willy."
Lou: A big old hug.
"Kingston: Hey, thank you so much for coming out. This should be good to get off the island, go see what Staten Island's all about. I agree."
"Brennan: You guys, so it's Willy, Lowell Masters who shows up. Who's also moving slowly."
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Esther and JJ, JJ can see Willy and is… He's like,"
"JJ: Holy shnikes dude, this guy. Look at this dude. This is wild, man!"
"Brennan: And you guys all get on the Staten Island ferry, Pete, this is the morning you woke up. So you get there right as the ferry is about to take off. So you see Madam Anastasia, Ricky, Esther, JJ, Willy, Kingston and Cody all here with Lowell Masters. Pete, what do you say as you approach?"
"Ally: Yeah, I think I just tell everyone everything. Yeah, especially Kingston, I'm just talking about how it was taking dreams away. It seemed to be a lot of… Like it was just subtracting something from the city or something from the people and that it's only banished."
"Kingston: Oh, well that doesn't sound good at all."
Zac: Did you tell us the Gladiator part?
"Ally: No. Yeah, yeah. I'll tell you that part too. And about finding Nod. Wait, sorry. The Gladiator part was at the end, right before I woke up."
"Brennan: The two signs in Times Square that had been shut off which literally you understand. You understand in waking what that means because Times Square and Nod is made up of everybody's dreams and ambitions and desires for the future. When signs disappear like that, it means somebody in the waking world fully gave up on that dream. It died in them."
Ally: So then I saw a Gladiator come back on.
Brennan: [imitates billboard flashing] Yep.
Ally: Got it. Yeah. I let everyone know that. Especially Cody.
Cody: This is all adding up.
"Ally: I'm like, yeah."
Cody: This is super adding up.
"Zac: Wait, I want to ask JJ something for a second."
Brennan: Yeah. Go for it.
"Ricky: JJ, I remember you and Esther talking. You are at Columbia and you found a particle in science that was literally magic."
"JJ: Yes, it was pretty wild, man. So it has to do with the physics of space- time. And basically, there is a particle within the understanding of science."
Ricky nods along.
"Brennan: You see JJ looks at Ricky already like… He's like,"
"JJ: Okay, so basically it's this, right? Nothing can move faster than the speed of light, right? Speed of light is the fastest thing in the world. And as long as this thing is like, theoretically you could time travel and like go back to the past. But in order to do that you'd have to move faster than the speed of light and nothing can move faster than the speed of light. There's a whole bunch of relative reasons for that. But it's this weird thing where, have you ever heard that light moves both like a particle and a wave, it behaves sort of like both in weird ways?"
Ricky: Have I heard that?
[Brennan and Emily laugh]
"Ricky: [unconvincingly] Well, yeah, sure. Awesome."
"JJ: So there is an element in terms of time, there are elements of time that exist in kind of measurable space that we can quantify and kind of understand. But in terms of relativity they change in certain instances, right? But when you get into studying quantum mechanics, the whole thing with quantum mechanics is a thing can break rules. It can be in two places at the same time, the rules of kind of macro physics and the rules of quantum physics differ. So we don't have a united theory of physics, right? So I'm sorry. I feel like I'm messing up."
"Ricky: I don’t... It seems like you're talking about stuff that… Well, generally my question... Did anyone find your research?"
"JJ: Oh, well, I sent it in because I applied for an internship at Gladiator."
[offscreen sighing]
"JJ: So I sent it in to them, but is that… Did I… What's up? Why is everyone's sighing?"
"Cody: [yells] I played Soul Calibur with you, dude!"
[cast laughs]
"JJ: Dude, they just pay super well. I got the cool thing at Columbia. I wasn't gonna work there forever, but like it's a huge thing on your resume. If you can… I didn't mean to fuck up."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
JJ: Look there's a…
"Brennan: Esther stands up for JJ and says,"
Esther: JJ didn't know the magical world was real three or four days ago. So we're gonna let JJ off the hook on this one.
"Brennan: You see, JJ goes,"
"JJ: Yeah. Look, basically the particle is this interesting thing, right? Because it exists where… I was studying it in Florida and I couldn't find it. It wasn't there basically, right? But when I came to New York or say in Columbia we were able to find traces of this thing that were fractal images of a moment of time where instances of time that were longer were actually repeating at impossible speeds, right? So there are segments of time within New York that seemingly, now that I understand within the ""Unsleeping City"", the beginning, I was like why are we only finding traces of this in New York City? And now I know about the ""Unsleeping City"", but basically if you take like a year in New York, that year exists as a standard year, but also has a fractal quantum… [struggling for a description]"
Ricky: Is it like New York minute?
JJ: Yes!
"Brennan: He points at you and says,"
"JJ: Yes! Exactly. There are minutes of time that exists in fractal quantum entanglement with themselves, where if you can isolate a 60 second span in New York, it consolidates to a particle faster than the speed of light. There are these minutes floating around in space-time here that are literally faster than the speed of light. There is nothing faster than [sighs] a New York minute."
Pete: Everything could change.
JJ: Yeah. It's pretty fucking wild. It's cool.
"Pete: In a New York minute, ooh you. Do you guys know this song? Nevermind."
"Ricky: Sorry, I."
[cast laughs]
Ally: Can't wait for that to be in a supercut.
"Brennan: You make it to Staten Island, exit this ferry, Emily what's waiting for them as they exit the ferry in Staten Island?"
"Emily: I have a secret flash mob that's just people having a lovely day, but in a sort of choreographed way. [laughing]"
[Disney music]
Siobhan: Like La La Land but Staten Island.
Emily: Exactly. (laughing)
Murph: Oh my gosh.
Ally: Stata Island.
"Emily: So it'll be like a kid loses their balloon and then a nice man catches it for them. But then falls over a grocer, who's putting out stuff. But then is caught by someone who's putting a mattress out on the sidewalk. [laughs]"
"Ricky: Wow, it’s really nice here."
Kingston: People keep catching people. People keep tripping.
"Ricky: I don't know why it's got, it’s a bad rap. I mean, this is wonderful."
Cody: Fucking incredible.
"Emily: Three, two, one, and now they all erupt into song. [laughs]"
"Iga: This, and take it from me, I know ‘em when I know ‘em, is not real."
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: All of you ascend the sky-bound fire escape that moves all the way up to the Monastery of the Midnight Sun. You arrive to find a small welcoming committee made up of Sofia, Cindy, who's the abbess, and Solomon out here. Cindy and Solomon both look over at you, Kingston. Cindy goes,"
"Cindy: Oh, Kingston Brown, I remember when you were here all the time."
Brennan: Gives you a big hug.
"Kingston: Oh, we're a long way away from Jackson's days. But I mean, Sofia holds it down."
Sofia: [flatly] You came out for Jackson?
Kingston: What?
Sofia: You came out for Jackson? You came out to Staten Island for Jackson.
"Kingston: I mean, there was a lot more going… I mean, you are so competent that Jackson couldn't handle it the way you could."
Ally: Oooh. Ooh.
Emily: I scarf a cannoli.
Sofia: Yeah.
"Iga: I brought you a box of Peter Pan Donuts, from Greenpoint."
Sofia: Oh thank you so much!
Iga: As a gift.
Emily: I put them out.
"Brennan: Incredible, Peter Pan Donuts. Cannolis from Staten Island, a true spread."
Emily: So sweet.
"Brennan: You guys get inside. Solomon says hello to Kingston and Iga as well. Solomon goes,"
Solomon: Hey Kingston. Good to see you back in the monastery.
"Kingston: Hey, nice to see you, Solomon. [to Sofia] I wasn't around here like that much."
[cast laughs]
"Kingston: I just, I'm familiar with these people. I wasn't like I was out here every weekend back in Jackson's day, just to be clear."
"Brennan: And you guys, as you go in. Kingston, you see a guy that you haven't met yet because you were not Vox Populi, before this guy had already left and moved out to San Francisco. But Tony Simos comes over to you, Kingston. And he goes,"
"Tony: Do I speak now to the Vox Populi, of New York City?"
"Kingston: You can just call me Kingston Brown. Nice to meet you, what's your name?"
"Tony: My name is Tony Simos. I'm former First Fist of the monastery. Your reputation precedes you Mr. Brown, it’s a pleasure to have in the monastery."
"Kingston: Hey, nice to meet you Tony."
"Lou: Yeah. Yeah, that's all. Just shake his hand."
"Brennan: Yeah, shake his hand and move on. Sofia, give me an Insight check."
"Emily: Okay. Ooh, bad. That is a 9."
"Brennan: 9\. Cool. You see Tony walk over to Ricky, Esther, and JJ. Tony looks over and he goes,"
"Tony: Hey, I want to talk, Ms. Sinclair. Alejandro was an incredible man. And I want to come over and say, sorry for your loss. He was one of a kind and an asset to the city that is truly, truly amazing."
"Brennan: And Tony looks at you, Ricky and says,"
"Tony: And this is Mr. March off the Fireman's calendar. How you doing, pal?"
"Ricky: Former Mr. March, how you doing?"
Tony: It's all right.
Ricky: My name is Rick. You can call me Ricky.
"Tony: Ricky, that's all right man. I got a lot of firefighters in his family, man. How you doing?"
"Ricky: I'm good. We're working on a new calendar. Um, or, Esther, am I supposed to talk about that?"
"Brennan: Esther goes,"
"Esther: You're fine. You're fine, Ricky."
Ricky: Okay.
Brennan: As the meeting begins to get started… Yeah. I guess Sofia—
Emily: Before I let Tony be in this meeting can I just do an Insight on him or on Cindy to make sure? 'Cause like I trusted him because of Cindy but can I do an Insight to see if he's bewitching Cindy in any way.
Brennan: Give an Insight check.
Emily: Okay. I have bad insight. Let's see. Okay. 19.
"Brennan: Cindy is not bewitched, but she loves Tony. She and him came up around the same time."
"Emily: Okay, so it seems like a sincere… She trusts him."
"Brennan: She trusts him implicitly, you see that. You see that Tony has genuine affection for Cindy on a 19. No doubt about it. He's very playful, gregarious, kind of a funny guy."
"Emily: I did want to text the group text and be like,"
Sofia: This is the guy I was talking about.
"Brennan: You do see, pointedly on a 19. Tony does not introduce himself to Cody, does not introduce himself to Iga and does not look at Pete."
Ally: While he's not looking I cast True Strike on him.
[cast laughs]
"Emily: Okay, this is like—"
Siobhan: Can I use my Ghostly Gaze? I have a weird… Can I use my Ghostly Gaze to go through Tony's wallet?
Brennan: I'm gonna roll a d20. Tony's tight bike shorts and workout tank top reveal no wallet of any kind to you.
"Siobhan: He doesn't have any info on him at all, interesting."
Brennan: He's got a watch.
Emily: Apple Watch?
Siobhan: Is it an Apple watch?
Emily: Ghostly Gaze into his email.
"Brennan: No, you don’t see, it's not an Apple watch."
Siobhan: I don't think there's going to be anything inside a watch that Ghostly Gaze lets me see through solid objects. So I don't think me seeing through a watch will give me any useful information on him. Does it look like an expensive watch?
"Brennan: Did it look like an expensive watch? Yeah, I guess it looks… Yeah, it looks nice. Looks like a nice watch."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Emily: Okay, I'm just going to text Pete and be like,"
Sofia: Do you want me to ask this guy to leave? 'Cause he's being really disrespectful to you.
Ally: I would text back.
Pete: I cast True Strike.
"Emily: Pete likes it, all right."
"Ally: I said,"
Pete: I'll take him down if he makes a move.
Sofia: Okay. I've got my eyes on him. You got your eyes on him. We all know this guy is possibly an absolute piece of shit.
"Ally: I'm standing up so straight, almost on my toes."
"Murph: Yeah, I think Cody is also seeing this as a chance to bond by being… It looks like he's standing near Pete smoking a cigarette."
Ally: And I love it honestly.
Cody: What do you think this guy’s fucking deal is?
Pete: I don't fucking know. I don't fucking know. But he's about to get it handed to him.
Cody: Fucking dick.
[cast laughs]
"Sofia: Cody, you can't smoke in here. You can't smoke in here."
Cody: I'm so fucking sorry. I'm so fucking sorry.
Brennan: It's incredible. Yeah. You see the Astoria boys over in the corner talking to each other. You guys got pad thai last night. You're feeling great. You're back at the spot enjoying yourselves. Life is good.
"Emily: I feel like I need to kick him out. But also, I don't want to disrespect Cindy."
"Brennan: I think Sofia knows that there's no way to kick him out without it being a huge clusterfuck. The meeting begins. Esther stands up and goes,"
"Esther: Assembled inhabitants, denizens and protectors of the Unsleeping City. Good afternoon. My name is Esther Sinclair. I'm the chairwoman and head of the Gramercy Occult Society, which has long worked hand in hand with the Order of the Concrete Fist to safeguard the city of New York and the Unsleeping City. We also have the honor today of being joined by both the Vox Populi and Vox Phantasma. And for the first time in the history of—"
The cast members clap.
Emily: Let's get a big round of applause going.
Murph: Look at Tony.
Emily: Look at Tony. [laughs]
"Brennan: Tony does not clap, but makes one of those faces of like, [nodding] sort of nods along the clapping."
Emily: This motherfucker.
Ally: That's so specific and that's so blood boiling.
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: You see that—
Emily: I'm going to Hexblade Curse him quietly.
"Brennan: Quietly. Cool, incredible."
"Ally: Wait, what'd you say? Sorry."
Emily: I just put a little Hexblade Curse on him just in case shit goes down.
Ally: We start leveling on him like we did on JJ.
[gentle music]
"Brennan: So you see that Esther looks out and says,"
"Esther: For the first time in the history of the city of New York, we not only have the ability to protect the city from threats external, but to also understand our externalities. And in fact, everything that we've come to learn and understand about the sixth borough."
"Brennan: You see Tony winces at this, the sixth borough is not a term that the order would have used back in the day to refer to Nod. They would have just called it Nod. She says,"
"Esther: Is indeed that the denizens of Nod are for lack of a better word, New Yorkers and deserve the extent of our protection and our understanding. Over the past two weeks, we have seen an influx of raw Umbra into the environs of the waking world of New York, both in the washing ashore so to speak of antipopuli, aboard a northbound A train on Halloween evening, but also in connections to other Nods of magic nearby. We saw not only the arrival of the Jersey Devil followed by his prompt defeat, thanks to Champion of Darkness."
Cody starts clapping.
Ally: I nudge you.
Pete claps aggressively.
"Brennan: You see Tony leans over and whispers to Cindy and say,"
Tony: This guy just fucking start his own clap. Did he start his own—
Zac: Ricky just nods. [mimicking the way Tony was nodding before]
[cast laughs]
Emily: Ricky you—
Ally: You devilish.
"Cody: I started a bunch of claps, just all the claps. So relax."
"Brennan: You see, Esther looks and says,"
Esther: Not to mention the appearance of an infernal codex itself in a Hot Topic.
"Brennan: You see that JJ speaks up and says,"
"JJ: Honestly, I feel I've seen infernal codices in Hot Topics before."
"Brennan: And Esther goes,"
"Esther: Right in this case, a real one, which is noteworthy."
"Brennan: She says,"
"Esther: Additionally, we have Lowell Masters here who should be here in a minute or two. He's in the bathroom at the moment."
"Iga: [hums in distaste] My mother, what she would say to me."
[Emily and Brennan laugh]
"Brennan: Incredible, you see Lowell Masters walks in. Iga, it looks like honestly, some incredible restoration work has happened on this chest. It looks to be in incredible shape. Lowell has really taken care of it. You see that it's on a small trolley table with some flowers around it. Some incense burning, brings it in. He goes,"
Lowell: Hello everyone. So we did a deep 48 hour scan on the chest here. Sort of understood the major things about it sort of right away.
Emily: Need to say deep.
"Lowell: Again for everybody here. Just want everyone to know, the margin of error on these identifies is, well, we would have to be, in a tiny fractional percentage to not sort of have a deeper understanding here. So the box appears to have been changed. And I am happy to report that these changes in the exterior of the box are a reaction of the box to a change in its environs. Far be it from the city appearing on it… The city and skyscrapers appearing on it..."
"Brennan: And you see as he shows you the chest, the chest has another complimentary set of skyscrapers. Now showing a woman with her hair tied in a scarf and a man with an enormous double-handed sword and a long coat."
Iga: Hmm. We are put together. Interesting.
Cody: Two sides of the same coin.
[cast laughs]
Iga: You keep on saying that. And do not know if you know what it means.
"Brennan: You see Lowell says, see he says,"
"Lowell: I want to be very clear to Mrs. Lisowski here that the appearance of a city skyline on this box, is effectively something along the lines of perhaps an adaptation, maybe more correctly put to be an evolution, because the forces that have prompted this allergic reaction of your box, aren't trying to put a city on it. They're trying to erase it. And your box is fighting back."
"Iga: Okay, that's weird."
Ricky: What's trying to erase—
"Iga: I mean, certainly my magic has not become less powerful. So they're not winning."
Brennan: You see that the—
Sofia: Is it essentially like a rash that's an immune response to a greater threat?
"Brennan: You see Lowell says,"
"Lowell: Precisely, exactly. The force at work that has changed the environment. I believe the box is responding to the presence of this raw Umbra within the city. And the Umbra is seeking out things like the chest that belongs to Mrs. Lisowski and objects like these fighting back and withstanding is actually preventing the tide from destroying or racing even more. So this chest right now, if I'm being honest…"
"Brennan: You see that Esther stands up, she says,"
Esther: Can you tell us more about the nature of the chest?
"Brennan: And he says,"
"Lowell: Absolutely, incredibly powerful magic of all eight schools of magic. Every single one. There are thematic associations within this, with legend, myth, stories, and particularly history and time itself."
"Brennan: Kingston as you hear this, go ahead and give me a Perception or Insight roll."
Lou: You got it. We'll go 23 Insight.
"Brennan: Kingston, you're looking at this chest, old and full stories. And now you see it's covered in skyscrapers. And it's covered in skyscrapers, all this wild stuff all over it. That chest feels good to you. You are well-versed in medicine and what you see is a city that is sick and you are looking at a shining vaccine. You are looking at this. And when Lowell says legend, myth, history, and time, you have this sort of vision of… You've never associated yourself and Pete with moments in time before necessarily. Like Pete's dream, you're the waking world. You're real, your community thriving heart, Pete is wild, fancy, chaos, but also you kind of realize that there is an association with time itself with both of you. You are a man of the present. There are people that are alive right now and they have needs that need to be met. And we have to stand up for them because they are living in this moment. The communities whose blood flows in time to the rhythm of the city is what you stand for. And Pete being next to Nod, is almost mythically associated with the future, with potential, with chimeric things, things that could be anything, right? And you look at this box and suddenly feel a third kind of magic. And I've already used a metaphor to compare this thing to a vaccine, but there's almost a comparison to a vitamin as well, but there is some attachment of this thing to the past and it is something healthy."
"Lou: Yeah, I think kind of taking that in, I look up to Lowell and Iga. And so,"
"Kingston: Iga, you were describing the inside as kind of being a fairy tale, right? Like some kind of castle from the places that you came?"
Iga: Yes. It's sort of an ideal of a castle of the Black Forest.
"Kingston: Is there a possibility, I mean with everything that Lowell is saying about the nature of time and what this speaking to kind of it is being a positive reaction. I mean, is there a chance that what the inside of that box could be changing? If that box in some way is tied to time or represents the past, is there a way that the inside of that box could change to be reflective of your present right now that that inside would become the city as that becomes the past? I mean, is that possibly the change that is happening in your box?"
"Iga: I mean, I don't know. It's never happened before. I mean, look I'm the first one, I'm living here. My daughter's growing up here, she's born here. But I, I— There was no precedent for this. There's no history for this. This is not the history. This is not the past. This is something new."
"Kingston: I think your box is incredibly important to this moment, to whatever is happening."
Brennan: I think Iga is in a very uncomfortable position right now. Her family heirloom was in this big room full of all these fucking magical people. How is Iga feeling at this moment right now?
"Siobhan: I'm very protective of the box because that's sort of all that she's been brought up to do. Like day one, protect the box, that's more important almost than your life. But also she does love the city and she loves her life here. And she loves that her children love their lives here. And she just feels, I think afraid, really afraid to step out. She spent so much of her childhood being warned that stepping into the spotlight was dangerous. And the whole reason that her magic looks fake is to make people think that her magic is fake. So that she can hide in plain sight. She spent her life hiding from everybody because the important thing is family and keeping the family safe. And the box is a part of the family. So putting that in danger, even if it's a means to ultimately save it, is scary to her."
"Brennan: Iga wrestles with all of that. There are no clear answers to her here. And I think that Iga is falling into a lot of loops. A lot of loops of how much her life is shaped by the actions of women who came before her, by the traditions of this place and about all the weight of history. But also this weight of not exploring, like all the weight of, “here's the thing that's going to control the passing of your life, don't look into it and don't ask any fucking questions about it.” And Iga is different than all the women that came before her. You moved to New York. And I think that Iga is wrestling with trying to keep a tradition alive. When you already did something that your mother and your mother's mother and your mother's mother's mother never did. As we move from that, you see that Lowell steps away from the box and returns it to you, Iga. Misiek, [pathetic noise] crawls up onto it."
Siobhan: I pull down my sleeves to take it.
"Brennan: Yes, incredible. You see that Esther steps forward and says,"
"Esther: So we can see that this chest and for the time being which I want to remind the assembled council is the property of Mrs. Iga Lisowski and no degree of importance around that chest should cancel the fact in anyone's mind that we would love to work hand in hand with Mrs. Lisowski to understand the chest, to the best of our ability. And how it may be protected by us, as it in turn appears to in some fashion, be protecting us by holding this advancing tide of raw Umbra at bay."
"Iga: I will work with you, but I cannot, I'm sorry, let you take it."
Brennan: You see Esther—
Iga: [shaking her head] This two days already very stressful for me.
"Brennan: You see Esther nods and says,"
"Esther: Of course, I understand."
"Brennan: Tony speaks up for the first time and says,"
"Tony: Madam Anastasia, as I believe your appellation goes here in the Unsleeping City, would you… Obviously the chest needs to remain in your custody, you're the one who understands it the most and is most connected to it. Would you find it acceptable to have more protection in your life, either to move to a more secure location than your current home or to have people posted at your home, should anyone physically come for the chest?"
"Iga: What, you think I can't take care of myself? I've been taking care of myself all my life."
"Tony: I know you can take care of yourself, Madam Anastasia. I'm worried about taking care of the chest."
"Iga: The chest will take care of itself. The chest has taken care of itself and will continue to, and nobody else can use the chest but me."
"Brennan: You see Esther looks over to Sofia and Pete and says,"
"Esther: In addition to dealing with the chest, we seem to have some resolution to the infernal business of the Unsleeping City with the [raising her eyebrows] “Night Angel’s” victory over the Jersey Devil."
"Pete: Yeah, that's my guy!"
[cast laughs]
Murph: High five Pete.
"Zac nods, mouth pressed very tightly together."
"Brennan: Esther puts a hand on Ricky's shoulder. She says,"
"Esther: However, I believe there's some interesting work in terms of the dream realm that we should dive into. As First Fist of the Order. Sofia, would you like to talk about some of what you've discovered in the scrolls of the monastery?"
"[tense, slightly discordant music]"
"Sofia: Absolutely, I basically, in looking through the scrolls discovered many allusions to dream monsters and dream magic that seemed to exist in a deeper part of the dreaming world. And that was alarming to me. And I also came across the fact that there was one section in which it speaks how to deal with a monarch of Nod. And it references the gray orphan, but it does only say “a”. So that is alarming to say the least to suggest that there may be other monarchies in the dreaming world."
"Brennan: And Nadia actually approaches at your mentioning of this and spreads that scroll “Forms of the Greater Dreaming”. So this ancient, enormous scroll of the Concrete Fist is expanded. And you see, Pete, there is a drawing of Nod, the gray orphan, and it's kind of an anatomical drawing. And you see, there are like pressure points on this drawing of Nod as like, if you were going to fight this thing, here's how you'd fight it."
"Emily: Again, I've prepped everyone that the monastery had a different relationship with the dream world than the current one."
Pete: Okay. I mean.
"Sofia: This is, this is an artifact."
"Ally: I look at Sofia, like obviously we're good. I know, I know. But it’s also, like—"
"Sofia: This is an artifact from the 1800s, I was equally alarmed by it. I was surprised. Yeah."
"Brennan: You see Tony speaks up and says,"
Tony: I'm sorry to interrupt. What are we alarmed by?
"Sofia: I think that when I see a lot of this stuff, look, there are creatures of the deep dreams that are described that sound absolutely horrifying. However, I have had very positive interactions with the gray orphan and Nod and the world of dreams. And so when I see an anatomical model of pressure points to hurt or paralyze or stun someone that I consider a business associate at least, that is unusual. And it disappoints me to think that there was a time that the gray orphan would be seen as a foe."
Brennan: You see—
Emily: Can I look and see like what Cindy thinks of that?
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and give me an Insight check."
Emily: 13\. Just like really trying not to insult Cindy.
"Brennan: Cindy is sort of wide-eyed and you see she's in the past right now. She remembers the time when the order felt differently. She was a part of the order when the order felt differently. And I think you recognize in this moment it is because of Sofia's victory. Sofia has everything lined up to be taken seriously. Like, victorious over the American Dream, sealed a Paragon from destroying New York, was part of this group of people that three years ago saved everybody and everything. And is the chosen one and was the wife of the previous chosen one. Like Dale cracked the mystery of the Empire State Building. You were chosen. And I think Sofia realizes that you wield an incredible amount of status and have pushed this place very far, very quickly. And maybe people listened to you because of how much respect you command, but maybe it was a bigger deal than you thought. And they did it because you are so incredible. But the other side of that coin, to borrow Cody's expression, is that they did it because they respect and believe in you, but they didn't get here themselves."
"Emily: Okay, yeah, I'm just trying to be really sweet and make this a gentle insinuation for the older members in the room."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: I definitely shoot Pete a little, [mimes eye contact] I'm sorry. Please know that I wish I could speak more frankly."
"Brennan: So you see Esther casts a Message cantrip to you, Pete and actually asks while Sofia is talking and says,"
Esther: Do you want to share what you shared with us on the ferry here? Or are you feeling—
Pete: No.
Ally: I Message back.
Pete: Absolutely not.
"Brennan: Cool. You see… So the meeting is sort of talking about these deeper threats. And so Esther says,"
"Esther: So it seems likely given everything that Sofia has said and our experience with the raw Umbra leaking into the city, the appearance of these infernals, the appearance of other things like this, that we are dealing with an ebb of something powerful from deeper within the dreaming. These tides, to borrow a phrase from Sofia. To paint a picture, think of Nod, the sixth borough like a coral reef, bright, vibrant, full of life but it's full of life because it is close to dreamers. It is symbiotic. It exists in mutual benefit to the waking world of New York City and their interplay, which is the ""Unsleeping City"" brings a vibrant arcane biodiversity. Past the reef of Nod is the deeper dreaming. and some tidal force triggered by we don't know what is moving therein. [ominous, dark music] And perhaps those tides explain the runaway A train on Halloween. It may even explain the appearance of Cody's infernal grimoire, we can't be quite certain. However, what seems clear is that these effects are happening because of events happening on the other side. And so it is possible that an expedition should potentially be planned or some deeper understanding at least of what is going on should occur. And it is also clear that the time has come where the resources of the city should be shared. We have a living Vox Phantasma and Populi at the same moment. We have the presence of this magic represented by the Lisowski heirloom. And we have warriors who will defend the city."
"Brennan: And here she looks sort of lovingly at Ricky. She says,"
Esther: So hopefully what we would like to propose is a research committee to look into a possible investigation of forces that work deeper in the dreaming to be done safely and responsibly with the full permission and guidance utmost of the Vox Phantasma himself. But a sharing of resources and open collaboration between the order and the society. Is this amenable to the parties herein gathered?
"Brennan: You see Tony stands up, looks over at Cindy. Cindy stands up. Cindy goes,"
"Cindy: As abbess of the Monastery of the Midnight Sun, we would be delighted to usher in a golden age of understanding and collaboration."
Sofia sighs in relief.
"Brennan: And you see Tony loudly goes,"
"Tony: Woo! [clapping and cheering] Let's do it. Let's fix the problem, gang, huh?"
"Brennan: And snacks are shared, cannoli are bandied back and forth."
Emily: Do I trust this? Does everyone—
Lou: Can I make an Insight check?
Brennan: Make an Insight check.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I want to do an insight check on Tony as well."
Ricky: Tony seems cool.
Emily: I got a 5 insight check. I want to know why Tony just—
Siobhan: 17 Insight check on Tony.
"Murph: I'm doing an insight check, but to see if Ricky's pissed at me. I got a 2, which for me is a zero."
(Brennan laughs)
Murph: So I just punch him on the arm.
Zac: Do I roll a Deception? 15.
Brennan: 15.
[cast laughs]
Lou: I got a 20.
Zac: I kinda turn away from him. [still clapping]
Lou: 22 on Tony.
"Cody: We’re warriors, dude."
Brennan: 22\. You noticed that JJ had a Detect Magic spell up. JJ had Detect Magic up to look at the chest specifically. And JJ is sweating bullets right now.
Emily: Oh no.
"Brennan: But you mostly look over at Tony. Cannoli are being shared, you actually do your insight. As Tony is talking to JJ, you go over to the corner. Tony's going like,"
"Tony: Hey, man, listen, you gotta have eggheads around. Guys, like you, they tell guys like me on the front line what to lookout for so we don't get our fucking asses handed to us. Oh, Kingston, have you tried the cannolis here, man, these things are out of control. I'm more of a baklava guy myself. Hey, try some of this. This is Ma’s."
Brennan: And hands you a piece of baklava.
Lou: I eat it.
"Kingston: Ooh, flaky, this is real good."
Tony: It's a filo dough. That's what I'm talking about.
"Kingston: Yeah. Yeah. Hey, so I mean, what an exciting meeting we just had. I just wanted to check in with you. I mean, of course you have been around the order for a while and I know you all haven't always… Your approach to the dream world is very different than the one we're at right now. But old school to old school, I just wanted to see, check in, just catch a feeling."
"Brennan: He looks at you and goes,"
"Tony: Hey, man, yeah. I think it's bullshit. That's not how I roll back in my day. Look, I'm not a great liar, not how we would have handled things. But you don't learn new tricks, the young pups roll you right over, so what are you gonna do? It's not my call to make. And if I throw a big shit fit right now and say, ""Hey, this is all bullshit, we got to watch out. Why are we questioning the wisdom of the scrolls? Why are we questioning the way the order’s worked for over a hundred years?” Cool. So no one trusts me. I'm not involved. And I can't be that voice of reason when maybe we do go too far, so hey."
"Kingston: So you let me know that the shit fit is coming, just not today."
"Tony: Shit fit is coming, but not today, pal. Yeah, that's where I'm at right now. I'll roll with it. It is what it is. Hey, it is what it is."
Kingston: It's what you all say. You mind if I talked to JJ for a second?
"Tony: Sure. Yeah. JJ, the man wants to speak to you."
Brennan: JJ looks up.
"Lou: How close is, can I pull the, JJ away from Tony?"
"Brennan: Yeah, give me a little Persuasion check here."
"Lou: Okay. Wow. I have not rolled a single good Persuasion check today. That is a two and a three, so a 10."
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah. You pull JJ away, what does Kingston say to JJ?"
"Kingston: Hey man, I just want to say it's been, over the past, what, week? I just want to say you're doing a great job and that you're doing a lot for the people of New York City. And we are just so proud to have somebody like you be such an influential part of the Unsleeping City. And I just want to check in, it seemed like you were having a bit of a hard time during the meeting. I saw you kind of sweating pretty hard while you were going over the scroll. I just want to see that everything was as it should be."
"JJ: Yeah, man. Thank you. Thank you for those kind words, and incredible. I don't think I even would've gotten the runes up in the longer time it took me to get them up, if you hadn't—"
"Kingston: Hey, I mean you got them up and that's what matters."
JJ: Yeah. I'm okay. It's just a lot to take in.
Brennan: Give me an Insight to check.
Lou: Okay. That I do better. That's going to be 25.
"Brennan: You know that your 10 was not good enough to stop Tony from overhearing you. On a 22 Insight for Tony. You know, Tony knew that he couldn't lie to you. So he put a very brave face on it. You don't think he's this fucking bubbly underneath. He said a bunch of shit that was true because he knew that he wasn't going to be able to deceive you. And I think Kingston is maybe a little bit… It says something about the gravity of this dude that he knew not to lie to you, Tony. Like that's something that makes you take a little pause of like, ""Okay, this dude is not..."" I guess the lesson from Tony is, Tony's not underestimating anybody and he's not moving from a place of panic and he's not moving from a place of urgency. The other thing with JJ is you see what's fucking JJ up. JJ sees some kind of magical aura around Tony. And he did it when he cast Detect Magic on the chest. But Kingston doesn't know what."
"Lou: I put my hand on the back of JJ’s neck. And I just say,"
"Kingston: You're doing really, really good work. And I will, let me give you my number. You don't hesitate to call me anytime. Anything I can do for you. If you're ever up at Columbia, I'm right in the neighborhood, so."
Lou: And then I immediately text the group.
"Brennan: Cool. You text the group. Your Insight is high enough that you know on your 10 persuasion, it didn't do the trick with JJ. JJ is excited that magic is real but he also knows where your allegiances are. He knows, so Kingston feels it not quite sink in. JJ is too rattled, right? As you guys head out from there one of the last things you see in the monastery… Obviously, not everyone's heading out but the people that are heading out together you're just heading out. It's been a little party. People celebrating the new… Like you guys got your wish collaboration the order and the society are working together, two Voxes. We know there's a problem in Nod, some shit's going on. The last thing you see is over by the ramparts looking out over the clouds together a dish of baklava being shared between them. You see Tony talking to JJ, is one of the last things you guys see. They've been talking out there for a while and JJ is laughing and smiling, as Tony talks to him and shares."
Ally: Is there a way for me to pass by Tony on my way out or I would have to go out to the edge and talk to him?
Brennan: Hold—
"Emily: I mean, you can always use me as an excuse, and I can pretend to show you something."
Ally: I really just want to do a little drive by statement and keep walking is my dream.
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead. Give me a flat Charisma check to do a drive by. We'll call it a DC 20 flat Charisma check to do a drive by where Tony can't get a word in edgewise."
"Ally: I would love to intimidate him, would be my dream."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Oh, go ahead and make an Intimidate roll."
Ally: Alright. That is a 24.
Brennan: Cool. You hit a 24.
Ally: Can I convince Cody to be by my side for it?
"Murph: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Yeah."
"Ally: Okay. Great. All right. Great. So two of us, we walk by."
"Murph: So we walk by, as we get outside, I pull out my cigarette."
"Ally: And I just want to say something like, pass by and go,"
"Pete: Hey, let that be the last time you look at me like that. Okay? Buh-bye."
"Brennan: He doesn't look at you, Pete. And he says,"
"Tony: I didn't look at you at all, kid."
Pete: Exactly.
"Ally: And then I'm like,"
"Pete: Cody, go, go. We gotta get the last word!"
[cast laughs]
Brennan: You sprint out of there.
"Siobhan: Is there a place where I can leave Misiek, where he would be hidden?"
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
Siobhan: But listen to Tony's conversation with JJ.
Ally: [gasps] Ooh.
Brennan: You're going to need to make a stealth check for Misiek here. Go ahead and make whatever Misiek stealth check would be.
Emily: Can I cast Pass Without Trace on Misiek?
"Brennan: Sure, you absolutely can."
"Siobhan: Oh sorry, I'm looking at the wrong code."
"Ally: Me and Cody are touchdown in zone dancing, but like hidden—"
Cody: That was awesome. That dude is fucking hardcore.
"Pete: Fucking, yeah, he didn't look but he heard me, cause he responded. So we have talked."
"Cody: Right, so he was pissed off. You could tell he's pissed off."
[Emily laughing]
Pete: How do you look at me though?
"Siobhan: That's a 28 with Pass Without Trace. And he has advantage on perception on all sight, hearing and spell and— smell and resistant to magic."
Brennan: Copy that.
Siobhan: So I mean I guess resistance is just magical damage.
Brennan: Sorry what is your Stealth check here?
Siobhan: 28.
Brennan: 28\. Cool. You passed Tony's passive Perception by one.
[Siobhan and Murph sigh]
Zac: His passive Perception is 26?
Brennan: 27.
Ally: By one.
Emily: He’s a monk.
"Brennan: 27, yeah."
Siobhan: Jeez Louise.
"Brennan: So you see him talking and he's going like,"
"Tony: Okay, Columbia is great. You got the whole world out ahead of you."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Tony: And don't be nervous to, all these people are good people. The Order, the Society, all these people. They're great. And I appreciate you stopping by to talk, man, listen anytime I can help put your head on straight. You just let me know."
"Brennan: You see JJ goes,"
"JJ: Yeah, absolutely. It's been awesome. Esther is so cool."
"Brennan: And he goes,"
"Tony: Yeah, I met her today for the first time. Seems like the society's in incredible hands, man."
"Brennan: You see, he looks at you and says,"
"Tony: So JJ, I wanna ask you a question here my friend. Why back in the meeting you take a look at me and you look like you've seen a ghost."
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: And you see JJ goes,"
JJ: [a little shaky] Um. There were two distinct effects on you.
"Brennan: And you see Tony goes,"
"Tony: Shh, it's okay. It's okay. Let me give you my number, we're not going to talk here. We'll talk later. You take it easy, JJ, huh?"
Brennan: And Tony gets JJ's phone number and walks away.
Sofia: Just so everyone knows I really couldn't just kick him out or anything. Cause like Cindy's the abbess and I just have—
Kingston: Makes sense.
Sofia: —to be respectful.
"Iga: No, it would have been socially awkward."
"Pete: Enemies closer, I think, I think you're doing totally the right thing."
Sofia: Okay.
"Ricky: What's the deal with this guy? We like him, or?"
[Emily laughing]
Pete: What? He's horrible.
Sofia: Are you not on the group text?
Ricky: I'm on a group text. I— that’s— Oh! Okay. That's Tony.
[Emily laughing]
"Pete: I mean he made fun of Cody's sword. Okay, he's got to be bad. Asshole."
Cody: Yeah. Right?
Ricky: He made fun of Cody's sword?
Cody: That's fucked up.
[cast laughs]
Ricky: [nods] Yeah. Pretty fucked up.
[chill music]
"Brennan: Cool, we're going to move into another period of downtime here really quick. So we're gonna go around, do some downtime activities. Basically, it's not like you guys are preparing the expedition right now. This is basically going to be a two week period where you are sort of like sizing up... I'm trying to think how to put it. It's like a two week period where you are pooling resources to research how feasible it would be for an expedition to head into Nod, to look up stuff like, how can it be done safely and efficiently and effectively. And you guys get a message as well of an old friend that's going to be in town and wants to get together at a Denny's in Forest Hill."
Zac: Brennan!
Brennan: Because Santa Claus is going to be here for the Macy's day parade.
Siobhan gasps. Murph claps happily.
Siobhan: Santa Claus is coming to town?
"Brennan: Santa Claus is coming to town for the Macy's Day parade. So you guys are going to… He's going to be here a month before Christmas in the parade! And of course, people think it's a fake Santa, but it's the Unsleeping City. Of course it's real Santa. So you guys get a message,"
"Wally: Dear friends in the Unsleeping City, it's Wally Claus. I love you guys so much. I live at the North Pole now. I miss you. And I will be there in two weeks. You guys should totally come to the parade near Central Park so I can wave at you from the last float."
Ally: Incredible.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Lou: Is that a letter or is that a text or?
Brennan: That is a voice message that appears on your group text.
Lou: Right. Right.
[Emily laughing]
Zac: He just intruded on our group text.
"Brennan: He says,"
Wally: I can move through in-between spaces and I can go in any group texts I want and as I'm secret magic Santa Wally Claus!
Iga: Who is this? I do not have this number.
Ally: “Santa Wally Claus!”
Cody: So Santa is real or?
"Ricky: Yeah. Yeah, Santa is real. Yeah."
Murph: See Cody's clearly extremely emotional.
Cody: That's fucking dumb. [sniffs]
[cast laughs]
"Pete: Hey man, are you crying?"
"Cody: No, it's fine. No dude, people they fucking made fun of me for saying Santa was real until I was like 12 and then I found the darkness. So I didn't need Santa anymore, but. [sniffs]"
Ricky: Is the darkness an absence of Santa?
Pete: Whoa.
Cody: You might say that.
Ricky: Would you say that they're two sides of the same coin?
[cast laughs]
Cody: Now you're getting me Ricky.
"Ricky: Yeah, I guess I am."
"Ally: I'm shooting Ricky a look that's like, ""This is too easy, stop."""
Zac: I don't like Scott.
[Emily laughing]
"Brennan: Incredible. So we're going to go through downtime activities here. Does anyone know what they want to be advancing, researching, looking into developing during this next period of downtime? Can also be related to just real-world stuff as well. If you want to be out making money doing something or related to like pursuing a relationship or whatever. Who has an idea of what they wanna be doing during downtime?"
Zac: I have a quick one.
Brennan: Yeah. Go for it Ricky.
"Zac: So I think Ricky is as aware that maybe the only thing he can offer is doing Divine Sense on the day. But outside of that, probably can't offer much. So I think he might see if Esther has a second to Identify his sword or something to see if that reveals anything about it. Just because he's trying to embrace the fact that he does not have the Questing Blade anymore."
"Brennan: Yes. She casts Identify on the sword and comes up with a very sad… You're sort of just in your apartment playing music, you guys are lying together being very happy. She is talking again about just like,"
"Esther: Yeah, it just feels great. It's like so much work it's going so, so, so well, I can't believe all the stuff that the order had their hands on! Like, all of their pra— they have so much more data than we have because their monks have been out there looking at stuff. And you combine that data with the Society's analysis. This is going to be a golden age of magic. This is going to be crazy!"
Ricky: [nodding] Nice.
"Brennan: She identifies your sword and she looks up and says,"
"Esther: Um.. uh, Ricky, I uh... so the sword is connected to sort of humility as a concept. It's literally called like the Peasant’s Sword. It does have more powers that kind of unlock when you are like, crazy humble. Like when you're an amount of humble that's too humble. You have to be too… It's almost not even worth it. It's a good magic sword. I think you should just probably use it just to be like a magic sword."
Zac: Ricky's never really thought about being humble before. The idea. It just was like I think innately humble prior to that but now there is something bothering him in general in his life that [laughs] I guess is intruding on that.
"Brennan: Yeah, Ricky, you feel that. You feel the thing of not only is it an insult that you don't have the Questing Blade. You have a sword that would be cooler than the Questing Blade if you didn't feel that you deserved the Questing Blade. But you do fucking feel that."
Ally: Fuck.
Zac: Okay. Okay. I like kick some drawings of the Questing Blade charcoal under the couch.
[cast laughs]
"Ricky: Okay. Yeah. Well, I'm going to go to Central Park and sort of monkey bar across the trees the whole way from the park."
Brennan: [laughs] Ricky is looking even more jacked these days. Just running.
Brennan and Zac both imitate tree monkey bars.
Brennan: Cool. That's Ricky's downtime. What is everyone else doing?
"Murph: I think Cody's talking to Pete and trying to be like,"
Cody: We should like hang out with JJ to try to make sure he doesn't do fucked up stuff.
"Pete: Yeah, dude. Yeah. I think you're totally right. Also you have a relationship with him, right? You guys were already gaming and stuff. So you got his number, can you just hit him up?"
"Murph: Yeah, I guess I'll text JJ and try to get—"
Ally: See if he wants to hang or try to get what— sorry.
"Brennan: Cool. Hell yeah. So Cody, you're also moving through… Throughout the next two weeks, various imps and devils come and pay fealty to the dark infernal night champion of—"
Murph: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: And you see that there's this weird thing. Bazathrax is like,"
"Bazathrax: Dude, I'm swimming in power. The Jersey Devil is like a big fucking deal. We got all this power. Dude, we're going to soup your shit up. You're the fucking man right now, dude."
Cody: This is awesome. This rules. Nothing can go wrong.
Brennan: But you also are feeling this anxiety around your devotion and attachment to the Queens Center Mall which is still scheduled for demolition versus this connection now to New Jersey. You sometimes hear the siren. Like you look out across the Hudson River one day and just see sirens at the Newport Center Mall being like singing wistfully because they can tell that an infernal Jerseyan energy has been taken away from their shores somewhere across the vast Hudson.
"Murph: I feel like I'm having weird conversations with Pete where I'm like,"
Cody: Do you think we could get a fucking cheaper apartment? If we were in Weehawken or something? It's just a train ride away.
[Brennan laughs]
"Pete: Yes, it was kind of far though right man? We're already kind of far."
"Cody: Right, yeah."
Pete: Yeah.
"Brennan: The Astoria house by the way is fucking bumping, you guys. It's not even annoying Lars and Brita anymore. You also see in that two week period. Cody, go ahead and give me a Persuasion check as you're talking to JJ."
"Murph: Okay, ba, ba, ba… Persuasion 14."
"Brennan: JJ seems pretty busy with stuff going on at the society. He games with you, but he's not available for an in-person meetup. Also with a 14 Persuasion you find inadvertently, ‘cause you share a room with Josh. Josh has been unemployed for a while now. You find an application for Gladiator in your room from Josh."
"Cody: Josh? Josh, house meeting."
Brennan: (laughs) You schedule a house meeting. Josh is not there that night when you find that. But damn do you—
Murph: Just yelling that through the house.
Brennan: Just yell. “House meeting!”
Zac: When?
Brennan: Incredible.
Pete: Right now?
"Brennan: Okay, any other downtime activities from people?"
Siobhan: I'll take the chest to the Gramercy Occult Society. And I think I actually might bring Jessica as well because I feel like she's not reacting well to my trying to teach her and introduce her to this stuff. But there's all these cool young women. It's maybe a more interesting way into it for her than just her mum.
"Brennan: Give me a Persuasion check and again for downtime activities, we're going to set the DC at 20 for downtime activities, kind of across the board. Go ahead and give me a Persuasion check."
"Siobhan: Again, that's an 18, I'm going to use a luck point."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: I just— That's cocked. [scoffs and shakes her head] And I'm going to use another luck point.
Brennan: You got three and you're burning through them with downtime.
"Siobhan: Okay, there we go, that's a 20."
"Brennan: Hell. Yes. Jess dragging her feet. She goes like, just,"
"Jessica: Mom, I don't want to go."
Iga: Sometimes you got to do things that you don't want to do. That is part of being an adult. You ask me to treat you like an adult? I treat you like an adult. You gotta do a thing you don't want to do. That's being an adult. Bam.
"Brennan: You're walking down the street by Bryant Park rounding the corner to the public library. Jessica looks at you and goes like,"
"Jessica: Yeah, but it's just such a waste of time, mom. You always call me up to the bedroom and open up the chest and show me the blankets in the chest."
Siobhan briefly squeezes her eyes closed.
"Brennan: She says that. You've brought Jessica to the castle. And as she says that you look, with that 20, I'm going to include an Arcana roll in that. As she says, “You just show me blankets and this weird old chest, you keep,” You see Umbra is oozing out of her eyes. (imitates Umbra oozing) She's really forgotten."
"Iga: Blankets? What do you mean? Okay, yeah, I think it's a very good thing for us to be going into this place together."
"Brennan: You look around the corner and she's like,"
"Jessica: Mom, just stop it. It's like magic isn't real!"
"Brennan: [roars] Orlando roars and she whips up to look at this roaring lion. Who goes,"
Orlando: Hello Madam Anastasia and welcome to Gramercy Occult Society!
"Brennan: And you look and see reanimated Rovias. And he says,"
"Orlando: Hello, young lady, my name is Orlando. This is my boyfriend Rovias, we guard the Gramercy Occult Society."
"Brennan: She says,"
Jessica: I thought you guys were named Patience and Fortitude.
"Brennan: And he says,"
"Orlando: Right, well, that's what we're called as well. I am Patience because I had to wait for this one over here to get rebuilt."
"Brennan: And you see Rovias goes,"
Rovias: And I'm Fortitude because I'm back from the dead. [laughs]
"Iga: And you say magic isn't real. Look, this is the magic of love."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: The two lions leap over to each other nuzzle and lick each other's manes and go,"
Orlando and Rovias: Love after all is the most powerful magic.
"Brennan: You hear from deep inside Gramercy Occult Society,"
"Esther: [yelling] No, it's not, the most powerful magic is always sort of a bit of conjecture. There's many different powerful magics, all varying. But in any case, come on inside."
"Brennan: You see, they say,"
"Orlando and Rovias: Very well. Yes. One of us always lie… Sorry. Both of us always lie. No, neither of us lie. We always tell the truth. You're allowed to go inside. That's the riddle."
"Iga: Good riddle, it was good. [waggles finger] You fooled me and then I got it, very clever."
"Brennan: You introduce Jess, who is 12, to Ana and Amelia and Esther. She has never met cooler young women in her life. She is completely obsessed. And you watch as Esther gives her a grand tour of the Gramercy Occult Society and you watch your daughter respond to magic in this way. You watch Esther not only figuratively but also literally make eye contact with you and [snaps] dispel the Umbral Arcana around your daughter. Esther puts a hand on your shoulder as you can see Ana and Amelia have grabbed Jess's hands and are flying with her through the Gramercy, she’s like,"
"Jessica: [screams] Oh my god, it's super real!"
"Brennan: [imitates flying movements] And you see, Esther goes,"
Esther: Happy to help. Jess is going to be just fine.
"Iga: Thank you. You know, we do things differently. That doesn't mean we can't respect each other."
"Brennan: She says,"
Esther: That's absolutely right. And I owe you an apology. We are different and I respect you so much now. And I should have always. And I'm sorry if I've ever said anything that indicated that I did not have the utmost respect.
"Iga: No, I have been stepping back too long. It was very dangerous for a long time to have this box and it gave us advantages but also my family, for some many generations we had to keep it safe. And maybe this is the time, maybe this is it that we use the power for more than just the protection for ourselves."
"Brennan: Esther nods and says,"
Esther: I relate to what you're saying more than you can know. Safety is really important and actually the most important person in the world loves safety more than almost anything.
"Iga: Oh, you and Mr. March, you got a thing."
"Esther: Yes, my wonderful—"
"Iga: That's cute. That's cute, you're a good couple. That's cute."
Esther: I think so.
[Zac laughs]
"Brennan: You see she says that,"
"Esther: But you know, I kept myself safe for a very long time. Things that are wondrous and magical and important. Safety is good. But if all you're achieving is safety then you're not really living. You know, that old expression the ships are safest in harbor, but they were made to sail."
Iga: I like that.
"Brennan: And Iga looks at her beautiful daughter and feels the feelings of a thing you've always tried to give Jess and that hard feeling that comes from moms when their daughters are around 12. Yeah, and I think Iga has been vulnerable in this moment with Esther and Esther's been vulnerable with her. The two of you sit and watch your daughter fly and you feel all those feelings of a mom watching her daughter soar. Any more downtime activities from anybody?"
"Ally: Yeah. I'm gonna go, honey, [finger guns] to Narcotics Anonymous."
[cast laughs]
"Ally: It works, if you work it and you're worth it. So, my consistency up and yeah."
"Brennan: You and Lugash grab coffees, he smiles."
Ally: I love it.
"Brennan: You go to meetings, you share. You're having a great time. Go ahead. And that means Pete is going to bump up to a d8. Pete's doing great. Hell yes."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, baby. Way to go Pete!"
"Ally: I didn't need to roll it, but yeah."
"Brennan: Pete is going to be rocking his… I don't know what the chip structure is necessarily, but if there is a 90 day chip, you're rocking it, baby."
Ally: Sick. [shakes his chip]
Brennan: Sofia.
"Emily: I'm trying to decide, because I think that I want to be tailing Tony, but I'm also aware that I personally have taken my sobriety for granted. So I'm like, is it possible that I can tail Tony, but also take some me time?"
Brennan: [pointedly] No.
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: You can tail Tony and go to your meetings. But you know that the, he is good. This guy was First Fist of the monastery. You know that to meaningfully tail him you will have to make room in your schedule. It comes down to logistics. It's time. It's just time."
"Emily: Okay, I think that he is endangering a lot of people so I'm going to tail him."
Brennan: Sofia bumps down to a d10.
Emily: I'm still in a good place. A d10 is good.
Brennan: It's good.
"Iga: Next time just so you know, I'm very, very good at tailing people."
Sofia [laughs] You have so much on your shoulders now.
Iga: I don't want to tell too much about my past but—
"Sofia: Anastasia, we’re asking too much of you."
Ally: I wanna know all about your past.
"Brennan: Sofia, go ahead, give me… I am not going to allow Pass Without Trace for this, because it's happening over a series of two weeks, but give me a Stealth check."
[dramatic music]
Emily: Okay. So just one?
"Brennan: Just one, just one."
Emily: [covering her face with her hand] Oh my fucking god. I got a nat 1.
"Murph: No, no."
"Brennan: Wow, we're going to have to cover that nat 1. I'm gonna leave you for a moment and we're going to go to Kingston. Kingston, what's your downtime activity?"
Lou: How long are we… Is this possible expedition into the dream realm?
Brennan: How long is it?
Lou: How long or is it a multiple day thing?
"Brennan: Right now you guys are in the process of determining things exactly like that. Like part of the reason you're pulling all these resources of this committee is like, ""Okay, if we go into the dream realm to try and look at this shit—”"
Lou: I think I'm going to grab Liz one of the nights that she has the least work around the Rico case.
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: And let her know that I’m maybe gonna be gone for a bit.
"Brennan: Okay, go ahead and give me a Persuasion check."
"Lou: [laughs] Okay. Oh, there you go. That's going to be a 22."
"Brennan: She looks at you, she squeezes your arm. She goes,"
Liz: I know who I'm with. I know who you are. I see you and all the work that you do to make me feel… Kingston these last two years have been the happiest two years of my life.
"Kingston: Okay, good. Same here."
"Liz: I know who you are. I feel like the most special person in the world when I'm with you. I know what that means coming from you and your relationship to this place and these people. Sweetheart, love of my life, you have my permission. You do what you need to do, okay. You've made sacrifices for me. I can make them for you. I'll be fine. I'll take care of Bruce and we’ll all be okay."
"Kingston: That's mostly what I needed to ask, you know—"
"Liz: You asshole, you fucking dick! Listen!"
"Kingston: Well he just needs to be walked, all right. I know you're busy right now."
Liz: I am fucking busy. You’re gonna wander off—
[talking over each other consistently]
Kingston: He's lazy he needs exercise!
Liz: To go to la la land.
"Kingston: Okay, all right. Well it's not la la land, it's the sixth borough, all right."
"Liz: Fairy, twinkle toes."
Kingston: We have to take this more seriously.
Liz: Magic land.
"Kingston: You have to understand, you know what—"
Liz: I'm trying to put away real pixie criminals.
"Kingston: Okay, all right."
[Emily laughing]
"Brennan: You see, you guys kiss and lay together that night."
Lou: [laughs] Very formal. An incredibly formal lay together.
"Zac: You guys fuck, and uh."
[cast laughs]
Brennan: You guys fuck hard.
"Lou: [slamming his fist into his hand] Pow, pow, pow!"
"Ally: The joy of the DM. At the end of any scene Brennan can be like, ""And you guys fuck and then we're going to move over to, uh"""
[cast laughs]
Lou: Y’all be fucking.
"Brennan: I meant lay together, as in being close with one another. But if you guys want to fucking bone down—"
"Siobhan: Yeah, physically."
Brennan: Be my guest.
Lou: Bone down! [laughs]
"Brennan: Cool. Kingston, we'll end on two things here real quick which is, Kingston the next morning you and Liz have a wonderful breakfast. She smiles, you go downstairs and see your beautiful mother Victoria heading out for the day. She's got her coat on and is getting ready. And she goes,"
"Victoria: Kingston, oh, my sweet son. Good to see you. You've been busy these past couple of days."
"Kingston: Yeah, yeah. You know, since Halloween things had kind of picked up in the city since then so."
Victoria: I wanted to talk to you. Your father got a business card from somebody asking about the building.
Brennan: She hands you an Excelsior Dynamic Homes business card with a handwritten phone number on the back.
Victoria: Do you know anything about this?
"Kingston: Yeah, this is spam calls and some real, uh..."
"Victoria: Kingston, it wasn’t a call, a man came by the building."
"Kingston: Yeah. I think it's some kinda… You know, Mom, if anybody comes by from this company again you let me know, all right. 'Cause I would like to have words with them."
"Victoria: Oh, I'll, I'll make sure to pass it along. Have a wonderful day. Give my love to Liz."
"Kingston: I will do that. Thank you, mama."
"Victoria: Ooooh, I love her and I love her living here!"
"Lou: Okay, I kiss her on both cheeks and look over on the back. Is there a name on the card?"
"Brennan: A different name from Devin, another realtor's name."
Lou: Got it.
"Brennan: You head out. Sofia, you're deep in the Bronx actually."
Emily: Really?
"[low, dark, ominous music]"
"Brennan: Yeah, you're way up north. You've been called on Tony's trail for a second. You think he's around the corner. You're in an alley. You go to the corner. Street seems kind of lightly packed up. What's Sofia looking for in general?"
Emily: So I came here thinking Tony might be here.
"Brennan: Yeah, you know, you followed him here. He was walking down the street and you just lost him a second ago"
"Emily: If that's the case, I don't think I have any… I think I'm looking for anyone who looks like a peer of his, anyone who looks like someone that they would say the kind of things he's been saying to me but not be discrete about it. If they were talking to each other."
Brennan: Sorry. Give me a Perception check.
Emily: Oh boy. (laughing)
"Brennan: You look around the corner. You think you see somebody that looks like someone that might roll with Tony. And you hear a voice right behind you in the alley. Go,"
"Tony: If you want to talk to somebody, you can always just say you want to talk."
"Sofia: Yeah, I don't disagree. I should have been direct. I'm just so concerned about how inflexible you seem and also how… I think you're doing shit that you're not copping to."
"Brennan: You turn around and see Tony right behind you in the alley. Old, you didn't hear him for a fucking second. And he got the drop on you in the way that people don't get the drop on you. He says,"
Tony: You think I'm doing shit that I'm not copping to.
"Sofia: Yeah, I do."
"Tony: Okay. You know scumbags, fucking bad people. Cause there's a lot of bad people in this fucking city."
Sofia: I would agree.
"Tony: Generally speaking, you can always tell the fucking grift they're running because they’re accusative of everybody else. Someone's counterfeiting money, they're always looking for that counterfeit bill. Somebody's taken a little bit off the top. They're always looking for people's shortchanging them. You tell me I'm doing shit I'm not copping to?"
"Sofia: I understand the hypocrisy of me spying on you, saying that you're not copping to shit."
"Tony: How about this, Sofie Bikes. I haven't broken any rules. I haven't done anything wrong. All I've done is tried to be a good monk of the order and I've supported you in every fucking decision you've made. So let's try this. You fucking tail me again, we got real problems. We settle old school. I am done fucking tiptoeing around. I didn't cross you, lady. You fucking understand me?"
"Sofia: You know who you crossed? You crossed Pete Conlan and when you cross Pete Conlan, you cross Sofia Lee."
"Tony: [yelling] You’re more loyal to the fucking dream realm than you are to the real world, and you're taking this whole fucking order down the toilet. And I don’t need a fucking—"
Sofia: [yelling] “It is is what it is” is fucking terrible fucking theme! It's garbage. Do you know how it feels to sit there in your room and say “it is what it is”? That never took someone from fucking nowhere to somewhere better. The order has a fucking lot to learn from. It is what it could be.
"Brennan: He nods, calms down, steps back, says,"
"Tony: Okay, it is what it is. And I got everything I need."
"Brennan: And he takes his phone on voice memo, stops the recording and vanishes. And that's all for this episode of the Unsleeping City."
[Emily laughing in shock]
Zac: Wow.
Brennan: Tune in next week.
Siobhan: No.
[Emily wheezes]

Brennan: (voiceover) Content warning - This episode contains visual and verbal depictions of clowns in the context of supernatural horror.
(tape scratching)
(dramatic eerie music)
"Brennan: Hello, one and all, and welcome to another thrilling episode of ""Dimension 20: The Unsleeping City,"" season two! I'm your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes."
"Brennan: Oh gosh, lordy, lordy. Well, last we left our heroes, the champions of New York were busy in preparation, both with the Gramercy Occult Society and the Order of the Concrete Fist, pooling resources for a possible expedition into Nod to see if the source could not be found of the appearance of raw Umbra in New York City, the material that composes the Umbral Arcana. The substance from the dreaming that prevents people from seeing or noticing magic had been showing up in the"
"city and bringing with it a wash of things from the dreaming realm, antipopuli, raw misery, misanthropy, hatred of New York's customs and norms, aboard the subway train, veins and currents of the stuff connecting other nodes of magic, including the now-defeated Jersey Devil, and strange forces appearing around the city, including beings that had been noticed by Pete, Vox Phantasma, in a harrowing confrontation. Our last episode left off with getting ready for the Macy's Day Parade, where (Wally’s voice) Wally Claus is gonna be on the last float, wavin' hi to all the kids. He wants to say hi to everybody! (normal voice) And you guys all wanted to go see Wally, but also that morning, Sofia Lee tailing Tony Simos, original First Fist of the Monastery of the Midnight Sun, having a tense confrontation in which Sofia's criticism of her order's mantra, saying it is not what it is, it is what it could be, was recorded by Tony Simos in this stark confrontation. So we pick up where we left off, but we're actually gonna cut over to Pete sleepin' in that morning. Pete, you are in deep REM. You haven't physically been to Nod in a while. You've been workin' at the bookstore, going to meetings with Dr. Lugash. You know, you don't make that much money these days, so you have to work a lot of shifts just to kind of clear rent, even in this new spot. But you have been visiting in your dreams."
"(dreamy, rolling piano music)"
"Brennan: We see a starry sky swirling all over with smoke and leaves made of mist and the beginnings of little flakes of snow as we head towards winter. Pete, you are in Nod in your dreaming state, flying. The full moon swirls and smiles at you, and the Woman in the Moon with her incredible eyeshadow and lipstick goes,"
"Moon: Well, hello there, Vox Phantasma. There are some people who have been waiting for you."
"Brennan: And gestures over to a puffy little lavender cloud in the eternal nighttime of Nod, where you can see an old turn of the century, turn of the last century four-poster bed that has The Gray Orphan sleeping in it in recovery from sort of wounds and injuries that they suffered. Give me a Perception check as well, if you'd be so kind right now."
"Ally: Ooh, yes. That is a 13."
"Brennan: You're flying high above Manhattan right now towards Brooklyn, which is actually where this sort of four-poster bed is. And what did you roll again? Sorry."
Ally: 13.
"Brennan: 13, yeah, your eyes avoid looking down towards the theater district, because you can see sort of bubbling away from Nod is the gateways from Glamour, that sort of dream tavern up near Central Park. You see the doors of Faerie, 'cause in fact, the Faeries that live in New York now no longer have to live as renegades, kind of stranded in the Unsleeping City, between dreaming and the waking world. But you see Rowan Berry's new Fae court, which is no longer… It is powerful enough and established enough on its own that it kind of now exists as its own pocket realm throughout the Theater District, going into Central Park and the Ramble. So Pete kind of clocks that out of the corner of his eyes as he's flying."
"Ally: I just start kind of rehearsing something out loud, where I'm like,"
Pete: I was in a really bad place.
(Brennan and Siobhan laugh)
"Pete: And I just, that wasn't really me, and I just really wanna formally apologize. No, no, I won't start it that way. I'll say, (vocalizes awkwardly) how are you? Hey, how are you?"
Brennan: As you are—
Pete: How are you?
"Brennan: As you are flying, a screeching shape comes out of the starry sky going, (screeches) which is that owl-monkey-angel thing that first appeared to you on your first time here. You now know this being very well. This is The Night Owl. The Night Owl )screeches) flies around and says,"
"Night Owl: (high, bird screeching voice) Oh, Pete, so good to see you. (gasps) Nod's been waiting. (screeches)"
"Brennan: (creature whooshing) Flies off and lands perched like a gargoyle, 'cause they're kind of… They have sort of an owl-like face but in this large, baboon kind of body, but with sort of baboon-like hands, and then owl's talons for feet, long prehensile tail, and huge wings spreading off of their back, kind of like an angel. (screeches) Sort of perched down, clacks their beak. And you look and see Pizza Rat with the little pizza tied to his back, looking at Nod as they sort of slumber in this old Victorian bed. And Pizza Rat looks up and says,"
"Pizza Rat: (high-pitched NY accent) Well, hey there, Pete. Good to see you, bud. Thank you so much for savin' Nod. They're not lookin' too good, but I think they're gettin' better."
"Ally: I ask Pizza Rat what happened and what they noticed, and tell me everything."
"Brennan: Pizza Rat looks up, looks up at The Night Owl. The Night Owl looks a little bit sad. You see these entities, sort of dream beings, look like they've been kind of lessened or weakened because The Gray Orphan themselves was sort of harmed. Pizza Rat goes,"
"Pizza Rat: Well, you know, we wasn't sure. And it seems like a couple months ago or somethin' like that, that Nod started makin' plans to go out into the deeper Dreaming. One of their siblings was in trouble, way out there."
"Brennan: You see that The Night Owl nods and goes,"
"Night Owl: (caws) We didn't know, but Nod, Nod has lots of siblings out there from the dawn of time, deep, deep out there in the Dreaming, in other spots like this. And so they said they needed to go and try to save someone. And they left for a little while. And then, well, they came back for a little while, but they were scared, like they had gone somewhere and come back, but it was a dangerous journey to get there and that something had followed them back or noticed them while they were traveling in the deeper Dreaming."
"Brennan: You see Pizza Rat looks up at you and says,"
"Pizza Rat: Yeah, they were only back for a few days or somethin' like that, and then, and then they were gone, and it was dangerous, and some of us started to disappear. It was like something was here in the Sixth Borough, but we couldn't see it. We couldn't find it. It was harder to see kind of anything. And um… (shakily, scared) yeah, like we could tell there was something."
"Brennan: And you see that nothing happens in Nod, but the stars overhead ripple (low thrumming) as though there is something circling the edges of this realm."
Ally: Whoa.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Arcana check.
"Ally: Oh great. (vocalizes rhythmically) Oh, that's a nat 1. Oh, can I get the Help action from Luna?"
Brennan: From Luna? I love it. Yes. Go ahead and roll with advantage.
"Ally: Cool. Hell yeah, that's way better. That's a 26."
"Brennan: Cool. With that Arcana check, Pete, you're here in your dream state right now. You think in order for you to heal Nod, you're gonna have to physically travel to Nod yourself."
"Ally: Okay. Got it. Is there a way to wake Nod up, or does it seem like they're too sick, or they really need the rest?"
"Brennan: With that high Arcana roll, I think they can, you can wake them up a little bit. They kind of need bed rest right now. And you can actually see, as they are resting, that little shaky Zs in a row are forming psychically, like Z, Z, Z, and they vanish, Z, Z, Z, and they vanish."
Ally: (laughs) Cute.
Brennan: You could potentially put a hand on their shoulder and see if you could wake them up.
"Ally: Yeah, I kind of rustle them a little bit and ask how they're feeling."
"Pete: How are you, Nod?"
Nod: (sighs) I'm okay. I'm okay now. It would be good… It would be good to see you again. And maybe… Maybe… (groans softly)
"Brennan: You see that Nod sort of falters a little bit and look sick. And I think on that high Arcana check, Nod needs your physical presence. And I think, weirdly, you also see that Nod feels… The Sixth Borough feels flattened or compressed somewhat, like there's the force outside of it pushing on it, which is weirdly pushing it closer to the waking world. And as you look at the sort of bedridden sickness, you're like, oh, that's the pressure. Like, that's what's pushing the raw umbra into the waking world. And as you see that, you see that Nod not only looks sick because of whatever was sort of feeding on them, but they also look sick because of that pressure putting them into closer proximity with the waking world, almost like they just have a cold or something. You think that a visit from a real doctor or a real medical professional might actually help Nod in this instance."
"Ally: Whoa. Okay, cool. Yeah, good to know. Can I ask Nod, like,"
"Pete: I heard that you were visiting a sibling of yours? Where were they, and who are they? What was going on there?"
"Brennan: Nod looks up at you and says,"
"Nod: One of my little siblings, they were… Their name is Nuria. And they, they live far west from here, west in the waking world. The directions don't really work like that here in the Dreaming. They're gone now."
Pete: What do you mean they're gone?
"Nod: I tried to get to them in time, but they're gone now. My oldest, the oldest of our family found them, got in."
Brennan: And you see that Nod falls back to sleep.
"Lou: Oh, oh no."
Ally: (groans) Shit. I make a mental note to bring a little Babybjörn with me when we come back (laughs) so that I can swaddle Nod. Holy shit. Okay. Can I go back to where I found Nod on top of that building and just look around and see if there's anything there while I'm at the kind of tail end of my dream.
"Brennan: Yes, go ahead and give me an Arcana check, and give me a Perception check as well."
"Ally: Okay. Perception is gonna be… uh, 14 Perception, 26 Arcana."
"Brennan: You got 26 Arcana. There is a hole here in Nod, and you can see raw Umbra leaking in. You are not directly facing the hole. It is like a weird, truly like a weird, shimmering, hazy planar rift. You can walk around to face it. You'd be standing right in the stream of raw Umbra that you don't think would be that harmful to you. But if you want to go look out into where this is coming from, you're gonna have to move into the direct line of sight of this rift in Nod."
"Ally: I already feel extremely lucky to be alive, so I'm probably gonna save that for when I come back with all my friends. So I'm just gonna also make a note of that. This is on top of the building, right, this hole?"
"Brennan: Yeah, this is on top of the Empire State Building."
"Ally: Okay, so cool. Anything new with the signs that were kind of shifting with Gladiator shit?"
Brennan: You still see those two Gladiator signs down in Times Square.
Ally: They're still there.
"Brennan: They're still there. Yes, yes, yes."
"Lou wiggles his shoulders a bit, nervously."
"Ally: Okay, great."
Brennan: I love to see Lou shaking over there. (laughs)
Lou: It's scary. This is all scary.
Ally: It's scary.
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: Ooh.
Ally: I have things to do.
Emily: Especially that gentle child's voice.
"Brennan: The sweet little child, cool. Pete, you wake up. It's the morning of the Macy's Day Parade. You have this new information, but you know where all your friends are going to be. We cut to Manhattan, baby."
Ally: Wow.
(bright circus-y music)
"Brennan: Huge roaring crowds, the Macy's Day Parade is starting. Kingston and Ricky, you're there. Cheering people, balloons, hot nut stands. People, bum- ba-duh. See up there, you know, there's two sort of prime, like daytime news, like Good Morning America being like,"
"Newscaster: Jane, at a wonderful day out here at the parade. Look at these coats. We love these coats!"
"Brennan: You see that huge balloons are coming by. Iga, up to you whether, what state of mind Iga would be in. Your husband, Oskar, has a bizarre fascination with, like, big celebration days like these and has indoctrinated your children into doing these horrifying, touristy activities."
"Siobhan: Uh-huh. I think she's into it. I think that it's like one of the things maybe when she first moved to New York that was a thing that they did together, 'cause it was so novel. I mean, parades and festivals are a very Polish and German thing, but this is on such a bigger scale."
"Brennan: Yes. So, and Cody, (laughs) you, all you know is that your crew of people is coming here to meet Santa Claus, who they apparently know."
"Murph: Yeah, I think Cody is… I think Cody definitely hates parades but is gonna go to complain."
Brennan: (laughs) Hell yes. Amazing.
"Cody: There better be a fucking Jack Skellington balloon, or else I'm gonna freak out."
"Kingston: I mean, there probably… I mean, who knows? I mean, that's the fun of it, right, is every year it's like, who gets a balloon?"
Cody: Do you think there would be?
Kingston: Could be.
"Ricky: Cody, we've got a Pikachu and a Sonic coming up."
Lou: I also—
"Pete: Oh, sick."
"Lou: Crazy, I was also picturing, like, Lou, the player, also picturing a Pikachu and a Sonic balloon. Those are the exact two I would have picked."
Emily: I would say Peanuts and Garfield.
Cody: I prefer Shadow the Hedgehog.
"Brennan: Iga, you look, see your 14-year-old son is there with your dad. He's gettin' to an age where he's… This is not necessarily the most impressive thing. But Jessica still has a little bit of childlike wonder. You see she's got a book under her arm, a notebook with a bunch of loose pieces of paper. And you see that she casts a little sort of Divinatory cantrip, is looking around at stuff. And she's going like,"
Jessica: Wow.
Iga: Be careful doing that in… Be careful.
"Brennan: She looks up at you,"
"Jessica: Got it. Sorry, Mom. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Iga: No, it's okay. Just be careful."
"Jessica: It's just really cool, there's…"
"Brennan: She looks up and says,"
"Jessica: I was wondering, too, if we can get home after today, I would actually love to look at the box, 'cause I was texting Ana and Amelia, and they were telling me some stuff about different Divinations and basically, like, learning a bunch of the arcana around this stuff. And it feels like it might be interesting to go and explore the castle together someday, 'cause I feel like there's a lot of questions about the castle's relationship to the box and sort of how it works that I think could be really cool to do together, if you wanted to."
"Iga: I would love to do that. You know, there's a lot of it I haven't even looked at for years. 'Cause it's like, I dunno, I… How often you go into the basement? It's just like a bunch of trash in there. I'm sure there's some good stuff in there, but it's like a lot of trash. Maybe we can do it together. It's like, it's a group project. We can go through."
"Brennan: She smiles up at you and looks again out at the crowd, and you… There's this moment of looking at your daughter just taking initiative. And you see her having this sudden moment of passion and sincerity about something, and I think even the ways in which Iga doesn't recognize her daughter, who after all is a full New Yorker, you know, that there is a moment of connection here. You guys look out and see,"
"Newscaster: Uh-oh, look out here. New and improved, but get ready to see them around the city, the Gladiator float, along with our new and improved Sparties."
Brennan: You guys see-
"Murph: I huck just a soda, just a full soda into the parade."
Emily: Into the Sparty party.
"Murph: Just a Big Gulp, just fully, just-"
"Brennan: Yeah, a full Big Gulp smashes right behind you."
"Pete: Oh, Cody! Cody, whoa!"
"Brennan: Yeah, right behind you, Cody, you just hear-"
Cody: Fuck you!
"Brennan: You just hear, right behind you, Cody, you hear (imitates siren whooping), and the cop from Queens is like,"
Cody: (very quietly)
"Cop: Hey man, I'm here off duty."
Lou: Can I head him off?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Kingston: Hey, sir, what's your name?"
"Cop: Oh, oh, Officer Brunson."
"Kingston: Oh, Brunson, nice to meet you. I'm Kingston Brown. I'm a community liaison up in Harlem. Cody is one of my, is a new friend of mine. And I understand that he has possibly a bad, hard past relationship, but we're workin' through that. And so I hope that maybe you can take it easy on him today. You know, this is a lot goin' on."
Cody: They took my sword. They took my Buster Sword. Give it back.
"Kingston: Hey, hey. Hey, we'll get that. Baby steps, baby steps, all right."
"Pete: Hey, man, you can't smoke in the crowd. There's kids everywhere."
Cody: It's open air.
"Brennan: Cody, you watch Kingston. Just around you in a circle, a bunch of New Yorkers… As Kingston speaks to this dude, a bunch of New Yorkers turn to look at Kingston. You immediately get the sensation that everybody is watching. Kingston's attention directs all of their attention at this plainclothes cop, who immediately sees the focus of all these New Yorkers funneled by Kingston. The cop says,"
"Cop: Mr. Brown, my apologies. Enjoy the rest of your parade."
Brennan: And slinks off into the shadows and is gone.
Cody: Holy shit.
Kingston: Don't do that again.
"Cody: It's like the whole city is your mall, man."
(Brennan laughs)
"Kingston: You know, Cody, I don't think you're wrong on that one."
"Iga: Kingston Brown, mall cop."
"Ricky: I'm sorry. Sorry, Cody, I overheard that. So when you go to the mall and you talk to people, they react like that? Or..."
"Cody: Pretty much, yeah, yeah."
"Ricky: Okay, okay."
Emily: Good thing the mall will never be back so that Cody never has to prove that true. (laughs)
"Cody: If you were there, you would know, but unfortunately, Josh, I think my roommate's busy. So you probably can't talk to him about that."
Ricky: Right. Okay.
Cody: Yeah.
"Brennan: So what you guys see right now is that a… This Gladiator float that just had a Big Gulp thrown at it is surrounded by these really kind of skinny, plastic-casing delivery drones. Gladiator's been using delivery drones before, but these are like a new… Like, you've seen advertisements for them around the city. They are kind of like skinny, human-shaped robots, with these smiling faces, that are waving at the crowd. They have these little portable cases, and they're throwing Cipher energy fluid out to the crowd, like-"
Lou: I'm sorry. What?
Zac: Sorry. What is happening?
Ally: I absolutely catch one of those-
Lou: What is Cipher energy fluid?
Ally: —if it's an energy drink.
"Lou: It's an energy drink, I'm assuming."
Brennan: It's an energy drink.
Zac: Skinny robots are throwing energy fluid at us?
"Cody: Nobody drink this garbage! There's quality products like Monster, Rockstar, Gamer Fuel. We could even do Mountain Dew. Just, there's a lot of alternatives to this."
"Kingston: As a medical professional, none of those are good alternatives. Let's just not drink any of these things."
Cody: There's things with quality ingredients.
"Kingston: Okay, okay."
Cody: Like Monster Khaos.
Kingston: Taurine is not a quality ingredient.
Brennan: You guys see that the—
Cody: [taking a drink] What's that?
"Brennan: So yeah, it's fuckin' creepy. You guys have seen ads for these guys around. This is the first time you're actually seeing them in person. It's been one of those things… Like, you guys know ASIMO, the little helper robot that, it's like, these are like a prototype of that. They're gonna deploy a fleet of these in New York as delivery drones."
"(Lou laughs, shaking his head)"
"Emily: Absolutely, we're gonna have to fight these someday."
Ally: Can I do a Perception check to see how skinny they are?
"Lou: Yeah, can I do a Perception check for their AC? Can I just catch that right now? Just real quick."
Zac: I feel like they're never gonna come back. I feel like these guys are never—
Siobhan: I actually would love do an Arcana check on them to see if there's something magical about them.
Brennan: Go ahead and do an Arcana check.
Siobhan: Great. 19?
Ally: Ooh.
"Brennan: 19? No, they are extremely unmagical."
Siobhan: All right. Okay.
Lou: If you say so.
"Ally: So that was energy drink, right? It wasn't loose fluid?"
"Brennan: It is, it is energy drink."
Lou: Hose. (imitates spraying)
"Ally: Just cans of, or."
"Brennan: Cans of, well, actually—"
Emily: Lighter fluid.
Brennan: little plastic bottles.
Zac: Can I try to catch one?
"Ally: Yeah, me too."
Brennan: These are the same things that was in the branded post that Priya's fiance on Instagram was hawking.
Siobhan: Ew. I absolutely smack one out of my 14-year-old son's hand.
"Brennan: He says,"
"Nick: Ugh, what the hell?"
"Cody: Guys, the Red Bull, the Red Bull truck is got… It's gotta be somewhere, okay. There are three quality energy drinks around."
Pete: (shaking his head) Dude.
"Brennan: But you see the little, this little contingent of Sparties walking around waving, walks off with the Gladiator float."
"Sparty: (machinery whirring) Hi, I'm Sparty. I'm here to give you what you need!"
"Cody: (yelling) I'll give you what you need. Eat my fuckin' ass, dude!"
"Iga: Oh no, god damnit."
"Kingston: Hey, hey, Cody, Cody, Cody, Cody."
Cody: What?
Kingston: Cody. Cody.
"Ally: I'm so angry by seeing this energy drink again, I'm fully with Cody."
"Pete: Yeah, eat his fucking ass, man!"
Kingston: Pete!
Cody: Eat my fucking ass!
Pete: Yeah!
Kingston: Hey! Please stop screamin' about doin'... such things.
Ally: I throw one of the cans as hard as I can at a robot's head.
Siobhan: I cast Hold Person on Pete and Cody.
"Brennan: Then this scuffle breaks out for a second. Cody, you feel your chest tattoo get hot, and Bazathrax is like,"
"Bazathrax: Yeah, dude, let's throw down. Let's fuckin' ruin the parade, guys. Come on!"
Cody: Let's ruin the parade. I love ruining parades.
Zac: I'm gonna cast Calm Emotions.
"Lou: I was about to ask. I was literally about to ask Ricky. I just see Ricky, yeah, yeah, that feels right. That feels right right now."
"Brennan: Well, you guys see that the… The end of the parade is coming up. There's a bunch of dancers and marching bands, cheerleaders. It's a bunch of clowns walkin' out and juggling and laughing. You guys see some of the last parade floats are coming by you right now. You see that Oskar looks up and he goes,"
"Oskar: Iga, look, look at this, it is… Oh look, Bruina Bearheart is here and the Chompsky's outfielder."
"Brennan: You see this big, floating baseball player float. There's a big Nutcracker, like sort of classic Nutcracker, floating. He goes,"
"Oskar: Look at that! It is the caterpillar who became an astronaut but didn't know how or why, the classic children's book character!"
Ricky: Inspiring.
Kingston: It's a good one.
Brennan: Everyone here make a Perception check.
Siobhan: Nat 20.
(Ally gasps)
Lou: There ya go.
"Zac: Damn, good."
Siobhan: There we go. There she is.
Lou: Second nat 20.
Ally: Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Murph: (two fingers up) 2.
Siobhan: Wow.
Zac: I got a 12. I have advantage.
Siobhan: We’re—
Zac: And I got a 12.
"Brennan: Cool, two nat 20s."
"Lou: What's up, dude? Us older folk, you know."
"Siobhan: Yes, we see things."
Lou: We know to keep our eyes peeled.
Siobhan: We're aware.
"Brennan: Iga, you, with that Perception, feel (imitates booming) your chest in your bag is fighting again and fighting hard against being erased. Like, (imitates chest thumping). Everyone else, you see the last float. It's Santa Claus's sleigh, and you see Wally Claus, who's waving at all of you going,"
"Wally: Hi, everybody! It's my friends from before! You were all friends with my dad, Rat Jesus, Bruce Kugrich Kugrash."
Kingston: Uh.
Ally: I fill Cody in on everything that he needs to know to make sense of that.
"Cody: What's up, Santa? Hey."
Zac: I think Ricky's crying and just waving at Wally.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see, Cody, Santa Claus looks right at you and goes,"
"Wally: Hey, little boy, you're actually 27, but you were 47 for a minute. I know everything! I'm Santa Claus."
"Cody: Holy shit. Yeah, no, you're spot on. Yeah, I was 47 for a minute there."
"Brennan: With those nat 20s, Iga, the box is fighting hard. You get a sense of your chest, and for the first time, you feel two sources of magic. There's your chest and the spirits of the chest and then the thing deep within that the chest was made to hold. Because that's the thing about a chest or a goblet or a decanter or anything like that: there are things that are magic, but they're made to hold things themselves. And you feel that your chest is both containing and trying to protect something powerful yet vulnerable deep within, on a nat 20, something at the heart of the chest that has been there for a long, long time. You also look out and see menacing things. Kingston, you feel another pain in your chest like you did at the subway. You look out and see the clowns marching in the parade looking at you and smiling, going, (chuckles maniacally) and you understand within an instant. I'm gonna say that you know some dream shit is happening here. All I can say is these clowns look exactly like the clowns surrounding the Central Park carousel, which you've been to many times, a New York institution, but they're here. They're real, and you know that Pete would like… There's something, there's something here that you could draw Pete's attention to it, because this is some horrifying dream magic going on."
"Lou: Yeah, I think I immediately check in with Pete and am like,"
"Kingston: Pete, it seems that Nod is here or Nod is bleeding again."
Pete: Huh.
Kingston: Do you have any sense of what's goin' on right now?
"Lou: And I think I'm now looking for, beyond the clowns, if there are any other influences that I see."
"Brennan: You start looking. And Pete, give me an Arcana check."
"Ally: Yeah, for sure. That is a 21."
"Brennan: 21, you see, yeah, Nod is bubbling through like it did during the subway fight again."
Ally: From where?
"Brennan: It looks like from up where the parade started, closer to Central Park. But these clowns, Pete would understand that clowns in the waking world… There are clowns that are just people dressed as clowns, and then there are true clowns, which only exist in Dreaming."
Ally: I love this.
Brennan: The parade is—
Ally: True clowns.
"Brennan: True clowns. These are not people wearing a costume. These are true clowns, horrifying visions from the dreaming. And you see some of the clowns are making balloon animals. Some are making balloon swords. Some are making balloon bows and arrows. Wally goes,"
"Wally: Hey, Merry Christmas later, about a month from now, to everyone!"
"Brennan: And one of the clowns goes, (chuckles maniacally)"
Ally: No!
"Brennan: Draws a balloon, fires a balloon that hits Wally Claus in the head. And it goes thump, harmlessly, and Wally Claus goes unconscious. And you see that these clowns start slashing the lines of the giant floats. They really cut them, grab Wally, and on four of the largest balloons begin to sail away up into the sky. What do you all do?"
Ally: Can we get on a float and—
Siobhan: (indistinct) them.
Ally: —cut it and follow?
Murph: Rush towards the balloon.
Brennan: You guys just rush-
Lou: I rush-
Brennan: You rush the parade?
Lou: I rush towards Wally Claus.
"Brennan: Incredible, I'm gonna-"
Emily: Am I there?
"Brennan: Oh, sorry. Fuck, yes. Pete has just introduced you. Sofia, you are rushing here directly from your confrontation with Tony. That happened earlier this morning."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: So you guys, as that's happening, Sofia, you break into the ring just as you guys are seeing these clowns about to act. Sofia, you see all your friends."
"Emily: Okay, cool."
"Sofia: Hey, everyone, I think I fucked up. What's going on? What did I miss?"
Pete: What's up?
Sofia: Did I miss Sonic?
"Ricky: Sonic went by earlier, but there's more to talk about. It's okay, there was no-"
Iga: Charlie Brown was coming.
Ricky: Shadow the Hedgehog.
Kingston: I don't know who that is either. Let's do something!
Brennan: Incredible. Everybody roll initiative.
Lou: I hate this.
Emily: I got 20 on my initiative.
(Lou rolls tongue)
Murph: I'm having a Murph day-
Siobhan: 17 on my initiative.
Murph: —of rolls. My god.
Brennan: Oh no.
"Emily: This is crazy, I didn't see any of this, but I'm gonna act first. (laughs)"
"Brennan: I love it, perfect for Sofia."
"Murph: (imitating running) Just like, show up and just punch clowns in the face."
"Siobhan: Oh, we're fighting? Okay!"
"Emily: Missed all of this, show up with a 25 initiative. (laughs)"
Brennan: Incredible.
Lou: Oh wow.
Ally: You start attacking Wally. (laughs)
"Emily: “He's possessed, right?”"
Brennan: Let me go down and get initiative from everybody real quick. And you guys can also boot up Roll20 now. What did Sofia get?
Emily: 25.
Brennan: My god. Iga?
Siobhan: 17.
Brennan: 17\. What did Cody get?
Murph: A 4.
Brennan: Great. What did Pete get?
"Ally: 20, not nat."
"Brennan: 20, not nat. What did Ricky get?"
Zac: 19.
"Brennan: 19, and what did Kingston get?"
Lou: Lucky number sleven.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, that's great."
Zac: A 7? (laughs)
"Lou: A 7, it's a 7."
"The Roll20 map, covered in cool and colorful balloon floats, comes up onscreen."
(group gasping)
(group exclaiming)
Ally: Whoa!
Brennan: Isn't that fuckin' cool?
Murph: The airplane is so cute.
Brennan: Love that.
"Murph: Cody doesn't think so, but Murph does."
"Zac: Sorry, where's Pikachu? Where's Sonic?"
"Murph: Hey, where all these famous copyrighted characters?"
"Siobhan: Ah, the Chompsky's outfielder is so funny."
Brennan: Isn't the Chompsky's outfielder great?
Ally: Whoa. This is so cool!
Lou: This is honestly incredible.
Emily: Yeah.
"Ally: So we're on a balloon, too, right, that we chopped and hopped on?"
"Lou: Chopped and hopped, dude."
Murph: Chop and hop.
Lou: Chop and hop.
Ally: We did a C and H. (chuckles)
Siobhan: Classic C and H.
"Lou: Classic parade C and H, dude, ya know?"
(Siobhan laughs)
"Brennan: A little chop and hop, baby."
Ally: True clown is so funny.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Lou: Yeah, the best part is-"
Emily: The true clown.
"Lou: when you said that like it was something we should… Like, you were like, there are true clowns, and it was like-"
Ally: These aren't clowns. These are true clowns.
Emily: These are true clowns.
Ally: The fact that there isn't a standup show in LA called True Clown already—
Siobhan: True Clown.
Emily: Ew!
Ally: Is shocking.
Emily: Ew.
Lou: Welcome to True Clown.
Ally: True Clown hour—
Zac: Get ready to get some shit thrown on you.
"Ally: At Zebulon. Yeah, exactly."
Lou: True Clown.
Brennan: I fuckin' love it.
Zac: (exaggerated deep voice) Do you know about the True Clown?
"Brennan: Okay, so what I'm gonna need from everybody here, before we begin the battle, is I'm gonna need Athletics checks. If you have no means of flying, I'm gonna need Athletics checks to see how far up the… Athletics or Acrobatics to see how far up the ropes you can get. It's a DC 10 Athletics to get on a rope, period. And DC 15 is like halfway up the rope. DC 20 means you get to start on one of the runaway balloons. As you can see, there is a difference in altitude between all of this. All of this is obviously difficult terrain. There are clowns that are sort of spider-climb crawling on all fours, holding balloon swords. There are also clowns that are holding handfuls of their own balloons, one-armed shooting short bows that are flying under their own power, and a bunch of these massive balloon beasts."
Ally: These clowns are so sick. I want a t-shirt with these all over them.
"Emily: Whoa, that'd be really cool."
Zac: I'm gonna be honest. I don't want that.
Ally: I want—
"Emily: Like a little button up, and they're all little and everything."
"Ally: Oh, honey."
Zac: To have a pattern of it?
Emily: Yeah.
Ally: A long sleeve that just has the clown in weird places.
Emily: Ooh.
Siobhan: Just an armpit clown.
"Brennan: Yeah, Kendra really went all out on this one. Wally Claus is on the top—"
"Ally: God, this is so cool."
"Brennan: —of the highest altitude balloon. This is all difficult terrain. The balloons themselves are not perfectly stable. They're balloons. Also these, the golden stars are giant, but you can see other smaller, just handheld balloons floating around as well. Not only is it difficult terrain just to run on, but obviously if these balloons are damaged in any way, you guys are well above."
"Emily: Okay. And are these… Some of these true clowns are just kind of floating in the air. Are the true clowns flying, or are they… Do they require the balloons as well?"
"Brennan: It looks like the true clowns are not flying under their own power, meaning that they're not like Peter Pan or Superman flying, but you have a feeling that if you were to drop one of those flying clowns with the short bows, they might be able to just make a sword for themself and jump to one of the nearby balloons, potentially. You're not certain."
"Emily: But the ones with swords on the balloons, though-"
Brennan: Are not flying.
"Emily: Are not flying, okay."
"Lou: Can you… Just because I wanna, like, not be wrong, can you confirm the order of altitudes between balloons? Like which is the… The bear is the highest. Who is the lowest?"
"Brennan: Outfielder is the lowest, then Caterpillar, then Nutcracker, then that is Bruina Bearheart."
Lou: Great.
Ally: Oh no. (laughing) Oh no!
Lou: Kingston is terrified. This is not ideal.
"Brennan: So first off, Athletics checks, did anybody... And again you don't have to—"
"Zac: Oh, I haven't rolled that."
Brennan: —roll that if you have a means of flying. But go ahead and give-
Emily: I got a 32.
"Brennan: Jesus, Sofia, with a—"
Siobhan: I'm using my Elemental Gift to fly.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Can I—
Murph: I got a 6.
Ally: Can my butterfly familiar fly out of my sleeve and give me the Help action for this?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
Zac: I got a 23.
Brennan: 23? Hell yeah.
Siobhan: I can send Misiek to give Cody the Help action.
"Brennan: Cool. Cody, go ahead and roll with advantage."
"Murph: 14. Or, wait, sorry, 16."
"Brennan: 16, cool. So if you beat a 10, if you're between 10 and 20, place yourself somewhere like halfway up one of the ropes to either the outfielder or the caterpillar."
Emily: What if I got a 32? Can I start on Bearina?
"Brennan: I'm going to say, Sofia, you can absolutely start on the caterpillar if you want to."
"Emily: The caterpillar, okay."
"Brennan: Yeah, if you've got over a 20, where can you start?"
"Brennan: 20? Ricky, you can put yourself on the outfielder."
"Murph: Okay, so I got a 16. That means I need to-"
Brennan: That means you're on a rope.
"Murph: Okay, I'll just be with-"
"Zac: And I assume Ox can't really help in this situation, just 'cause we're..."
"Brennan: Yeah, I think, probably we lose Ox for this one."
Zac: Cool.
Siobhan: And how about—
"Murph: And my moped, I assume."
Brennan: What's that?
Murph: And my moped.
Brennan: Moped we probably lose as well.
"Zac: Ox is gonna stay with the children, (laughs) with Iga's kids."
Siobhan: Yeah. How about Iga? Where can Iga go?
Brennan: Iga's flying. So Iga can start wherever you want.
Siobhan: Hell yeah. Can I actually start on the bear? Is that...
Brennan: I'm gonna say you should start lower altitude.
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: So I would start-
Siobhan: Maybe I'll start near Sofia.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Great. And then Misiek is with Cody, who is here."
Ally: I love my little butterfly.
Lou: “I love my little butterfly.”
Siobhan: Pretty cute.
Ally: It's my green butterfly named Luna.
Siobhan: Yes.
Ally: So just think about that.
"Siobhan: (sarcastically) Wow, you came up with that yourself?"
"Lou: Oh, so that's what you-"
Siobhan: Pretty cool.
Lou: When you asked for the Help action.
Emily: I thought you were taking a Help action from the moon.
Lou: I also thought you were—
"Ally: Oh, no."
"Lou: —taking a Help action directly from the big, the eyeshadow-wearing moon."
Zac: I forgot.
"Lou: I pictured, I thought-"
Siobhan: Can the moon give me a Help action?
"Zac: You just ask it, please, do something to help me."
Lou: Is Brennan gonna narrate it?
"Brennan: Okay. Ricky's on the outfielder. Kingston's got the rope. Cody's on some rope as well. Pete, are you on that rope too?"
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Iga is flying.
Ally: Bros helpin' bros.
Murph briefly mimes holding onto a rope.
Brennan: Iga is flying over the caterpillar. And Sofia's up on the caterpillar. Hell yeah.
Emily: Let me make sure this is...
"Brennan: And remember, Sofia, that some of these distances will be adjusted due to altitude as well. So like, that's 35 feet away horizontally, but it might be farther away when you factor in how much higher it is as well. (someone whistles) Hell yes, gang. We're gonna jump right into combat, and Sofia… So, whoosh, some of you are holding ropes. These balloons streak off into the sky. You can hear screams from the crowd below. You're all hanging on for dear life. Sofia, you get up onto the balloon and are running in a pair of Louboutins on top of a giant helium balloon."
"Sofia: Hey, everyone was just… I don't know what's goin' on, but everyone was just jumpin' on balloons, so I don't know. I fit in if I can."
"Emily: If I can, can I do… I wanna know if I could… I think that since Sofia, all Sofia sees is Wally's down, she'll probably just try to go to protect Wally. However, there is a curiosity if I could jump down and swing from one of these severed cords and kick through the window of a building, and fuck… And basically, that Nutcracker, if I could jump down, swing from its severed cord, kick through the window of a building, and then essentially keep that balloon from rising and hopefully, maybe, destabilize the people on it?"
"Brennan: Hell yeah, if you wanted to try to attach one of the major balloons to a building, absolutely go for it."
"Emily: Okay, I'm trying to think if that's the right thing to do. And I feel like… (groans) I feel like I should probably just go help Wally, but I am curious about that. Okay, you know what, I'll know that I can do that later. I'm going to just jump from here to… I would like to jump onto the bear before I—"
Brennan: Hell yes. Let's see here. Sofia has not cast Jump but has the boots. Are you doing Step of the Wind?
Emily: If I need to.
Brennan: Cool. What's your Strength score again? Just asking.
"Emily: My Strength score is 13. So I guess my jump is 39, right? 'Cause it's three times."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Can you trampoline jump on the balloon?
(Emily and Brennan laugh)
"Brennan: I'm gonna say this… So your high jump, you can reach up and grab something 20.2 feet off the ground. This is 30 feet up above you. Like, the bottom of the bear float is 30 feet away from the top of the caterpillar one. So you're either gonna have to do Step of the Wind or cast Jump to get that next boost to clear that."
"Emily: I'll cast Jump, because I might as well."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: So yeah, I guess I just cast Jump. If I'm gonna fuckin' cast Jump, maybe I should just try to… Nah, okay. I'll just do that. I cast Jump on myself, and I jump up onto the bear."
"Brennan: La Gran Gata swirls around you, goes, (snorts)"
"La Gran Gata: Ah, look, these are true clowns from the Sixth Borough. They do not belong here!"
"Sofia: True clowns? I'm sorry, what's that? I missed all this context. What's a true clown?"
"La Gran Gata: Oh, sorry. There's true clowns. Oh look, it's the big, it's the Garfield."
"Brennan: And you see La Gran Gata looks at the Garfield, and says—"
La Gran Gata nods.
"Sofia: Okay, we know you got a crush."
"La Gran Gata: What? I just approve of his lifestyle. He hates Mondays, and he love lasagna."
Sofia: I know. I know.
Ally: A crush on Garfield?
Sofia: And I want it for you. I know you've got that crush.
Ally: Sex symbol Garfield the Cat. We all know.
"Brennan: Sex symbol Garfield. So you use your action to cast Jump, spring across. You have a bonus action left, but you've used..."
"Emily: Yeah, I can't use bonus. I think I'll take a bonus. (groans) I think I'm—"
Brennan: You've used 40 feet of movement to clear… You're now on the yellow propeller of Bearheart.
"Emily: Yeah, so I'm on the yellow propeller, I think that… Is there any clown that looks particularly powerful, or do all these true clowns seem to be the same?"
"Brennan: You get the feeling that the true clowns are pretty similar all across the board, and that their fighting styles differ, but they're pretty similar."
"Emily: All right, fuck it, I'm just gonna hex… I'll Hexblade Curse the clown that's nearest to Wally."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: Just in case I need it, to get that out of the way."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Moving down the initiative order, that's gonna be Pete. Pete, these true clowns laugh and giggle, and I'm going to need you… Pete, your calmness in your life and your mental health have been so good recently, your control over and relationship to your magic has been so positive. Your life is a lot more stable. I'm gonna… The presence of clowns ripples into you with pure dream and chaos magic. I'm gonna need three wild magic rolls in a row from the three spells you cast at the Holland Tunnel fight, that none of which… You were so in control of yourself that this wild magic comes roiling back in. So this first roll is a surge on a 1, 2, 3. Give me the roll."
Ally: Oh my god. It's a 4.
(Emily gasps)
"Brennan: This next roll is a 1, 2, 3, 4. Go ahead and give it to me."
Ally: It's a 5. I'm not kidding.
(group gasping)
(Emily laughing)
Ally: Oh my god. Yes.
"Brennan: You get, like whoever's… Cody, you see Pete. You have a dark Infernal thing. You see Pete's face is rippling like he's in a wind tunnel, like (imitates flesh quavering) But he's full Akira, or like, you know, just like, (growls) like rippling muscles."
"Cody: This is awesome. Pete, this is awesome. Give in or don't. I don't know, whichever one's more rad."
"Pete: Thanks, man. Thanks, man."
Cody: No problem.
"Brennan: Pete, this is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 triggers the surge here."
Ally: That's a 5.
All: Oh!
Brennan: Brutal.
"Emily: But sometimes it might just cast Fly on you, right?"
Murph: That would be great. Please cast Fly.
Ally: I'm just sayin'-
Emily: Maybe you just get Fly.
"Ally: Look, it's probably Fly."
"Siobhan: And you get two, right, you get—"
"Zac: Yeah, you get to choose."
Siobhan: You get to roll it twice.
"Brennan: So roll, roll a d100, which is, again, just… You should have the percentile 10-sided dice and then the singles 10-sided dice. Go ahead and roll that. Roll a d100 twice. Give me both rolls."
"Ally: Okay, 24, and—"
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Ooh, then all zeros, I don't know what that means."
Lou: Is that a 100?
Brennan: That's a 100.
(Siobhan gasps)
"Ally: Oh, whoa."
Brennan: Okay.
"Ally: No, oh no."
"Brennan: You could either give in to… There is something that will have a very tangible, physical effect that you don't know will be expressly harmful or helpful, and there's a thing that has a very powerful ethereal effect that you're not sure if it will be particularly harmful or helpful."
(tense music)
"Ally: I'm gonna go ethereal, just because we're literally on balloons, and I don't wanna become really heavy or like..."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: Like, spiky."
(Siobhan laughs)
"Brennan: So Wild Magic Surge is actually going to manifest at the end of this turn. You are going to regain all expended sorcery points at the end of this turn. So you feel, (energy quavering) and Pete, you are trained. It's been three years, baby. You are not the fuckin' rookie anymore. Cody's the fuckin' rookie. (laughs)"
Ally: Fuck that guy!
"Brennan: Fuck that guy, you're actually… Pete and Cody are like true buds. It's great."
"Ally: Oh yeah, definitely."
"Emily: True class, true buds."
"Brennan: Pete, you reach into Nod. Feel the Wild Magic Surge, control it, (energy thrumming) but also embrace it and allow it to happen, are gonna pull in any expended sorcery points at the end of turn. (Ally whistles) Go ahead and take your turn."
Emily: Go to town.
Ally: Okay.
Emily: So many sorcery points.
Zac: So you can just use a bunch of sorcery points right now?
Ally: Yep.
"Cody: Pete, just absolutely—"
Ally: Sounds like.
"Cody: —freak out, dude. Just freak out."
"Ally: Okay, I am going to cast a… I'm trying to figure out if… Can I do some sort of a roll to see if I have to avoid piercing any of these balloons?"
"Brennan: I think you would know the balloons are not dream realm. So if you pierce these balloons, they're gonna pop."
Ally: But can I do a Careful Spell and count the balloon as something that isn't affected?
"Brennan: Shit. Absolutely, you can. Yes, you can."
"Ally: Hell yes. All right, honey, then you know I'm casting a fifth-level Fireball."
(Brennan and Siobhan laugh)
"Ally: So that is gonna be 10d6. I'm gonna cast it on… Let's see, Fireball, we're gonna go ahead, 150, So I think that… I can't click. Okay, I'm gonna try to get the two clowns that are next to Wally. They're 20 feet apart."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you can absolutely grab both of them and Careful Wally, Bruina Bearheart, the balloon, and Sofia. And you'll be good to go."
"Ally: Can I actually center it on the clown next to Sofia so that I can get both clowns? There's one 15 feet away, hanging beneath."
"Brennan: It's a 20-foot radius, right?"
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Let me just check the measurements. So that's 40. It's 40 feet. You know what? Yes. You can absolutely grab all three of them, absolutely."
Ally: Incredible.
Murph: Sweet.
Ally: Okay. Then I'm just gonna roll.
"Emily: Oh, I can't wait to be surrounded by flames. (laughs)"
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: And get hurt by it.
Ally: Get ready.
Siobhan: Cody's so jealous.
"Murph: Yeah, I think Cody thinks that Pete is gonna explode, and we're both gonna be a fireball."
"Cody: Do it. Give in. Surrender to the flames, Pete. Fuck."
Emily: “I cast Ice Feast.”
(all laugh)
Brennan: Yes.
Ally rolls Fireball damage. Three 6’s are in there.
"Murph: Oh, those are good numbers. (claps)"
"Siobhan: Oh, nice."
Emily: Woo-hoo!
Zac: Wow.
Lou: Bam.
Siobhan: Look at that.
Brennan: Damn!
Siobhan: Look at those 6’s.
Brennan: Oh my god.
"Murph: Ooh, three sixes. 6, 6, 6. Sick."
(group chuckling)
"Ally: So I am going to… Yes, and then… Hmm."
Brennan: Immediately give me another Wild Magic check.
Ally: Interesting. So just not a nat 1.
Emily: Now it's back down to one.
Ally: 15.
Brennan: Cool. Now it's one and two.
"Ally: Okay. Great, so that's 45 to those three."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: And you know what, I'm actually gonna… I'm gonna make that, use two more sorcery points to have made that a bonus action."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: And then I'm just gonna take out my gun and shoot the Nutcracker balloon and try to sink all those guys.
(Brennan laughs)
Lou: Jesus.
Murph: Whoa.
"Cody: Holy shit, Pete, you have a fuckin' gun."
"Pete: Yes. (loudly) Hey, sorry, everyone. (imitates gun banging)"
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and make an attack roll with your pistol."
Ally: Great. Okay. Nat 20!
(Emily laughs)
Brennan: (completely flat expression) Are you fucking for real right now?
(Emily squeals)
(Murph laughs)
Ally raises a notebook to display their d20.
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Please, sir, please, sir, look at my die. Please?"
Brennan: Oh my god.
"Ally: Fuck off, balloon."
Murph: You rolled a 100 on a d100 and—
Murph and Brennan: A nat 20.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll double damage for that attack.
"Ally: Fuck yes. Okay. Amazing. So that is going to be… So double is just two d6's plus 3 plus 6. Oh, hell yeah, 8. 14 damage to the Nutcracker. I saved the bear, but I attacked the Nutcracker."
"Brennan: Incredible, Pete, you pull out this vintage… So Pete, you, (whooshing) your arm splits. You're roiling with wild magic. (whooshing) Bruina Bearheart, Sofia, you see this fireball coming. (fire roaring) It licks all over you."
"Sofia: I trust you, Pete. I trust you, Pete."
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: Yeah, you see it La Gran Gata full (screeches) rears up on your shoulders, arches."
Sofia: Go get Garfield.
"Brennan: The fire spans all of them. And while Pete is doing that, through the flame, you just fire this pistol in this perfect grazing shot to… 'Cause you know that one small puncture won't get the job done. So you go across the crest of the Nutcracker's hat and just (imitates bullet whizzing) rip a seam open with your bullet."
Ally: Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: It will take a while for the balloon to lose a lot of helium, but the main thing is it doesn't matter if… Because this thing has more than 14 hit points, but it immediately loses speed. It's not rising as high as the other balloons. So unless those clowns can jump off, they are going to… Like, those clowns have to basically run and sprint, because the tear you created means that the rise of the Nutcracker rapidly slows as it starts to lose helium."
Ally: Sick.
Emily: How do the guys look after that Fireball?
Brennan: Here's the deal.
Emily: Since I'm standing face-to-face with that true clown.
"Brennan: Pete, all three of those clowns Wild Magic Surge (Siobhan gasps) in response to your spell. I'm gonna roll three saving throws right now. If these saving throws beat your DC, which is 17, it's some bad news for Pete."
Zac: Can you Bend Luck?
Ally: Wait. My magic triggered their Wild Magic Surges?
"Brennan: These things are… True clowns are something that you remember from the Metropolitan Museum of Memories, but it's intense, what's going on here. These things are like reflections of the force of Vox Phantasma in the past. They are like beings of chaos and comedy and laughter and trickery. So they have their own Wild Magic Surge in response to yours. But I'll say you can tell they're using this as a reaction. This is not something that is effortless for them to do. They can't do it infinitely, but they're doing it right now."
"Ally: Can I, before you do this, say that I'd like to use Bend Luck potentially?"
"Brennan: Cool. They're gonna make three rolls. You'll see what the rolls are. I'm not going to announce what their bonus is. So you'll have to just decide, based on the rolls flat on the die, whether you wanna use them or not."
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: Here comes 3d20 right now.
(suspenseful music)
(someone sighs)
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: That's a 10, an 11, and a 3."
Ally: And they're trying to beat 17?
Brennan: They're trying to beat 17.
"Ally: Yeah. I mean, I get these sorcery points back. So I'm absolutely just going to use Bend Luck on that 11."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Go ahead and roll your d4.
Ally: 3\.
Brennan: So you subtract 3 from that roll.
Ally nods.
"Brennan: Holy shit. Here's the deal. Those rolls weren't great. Pete's damage rolls were amazing. They had this very cool power that only works if they make their save, and they don't. I know that we just started this fight. Pete, all three clowns are fully incinerated. (laughs)"
(group exclaiming)
Murph: Holy shit!
Brennan: Fully fucking gone.
: Yes.
(Brennan roars)
Ally: Fuck yeah. Sick.
"Siobhan: Get outta here, you dang clowns."
"Ally: Sick, sick, sick."
"Brennan: Holy shit, Pete is the Vox Phantasma and is very good at this."
Zac: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you got 45 damage, and no one makes the save for half is bad fuckin' news. Okay. Any movement from Pete that turn?"
Ally: Would love to get up on the balloon if possible.
"Brennan: Cool, you can take a Help action from Luna, but give me an Athletics DC 10 to get up there."
"Ally: You got it. Yeah, great, 13."
"Brennan: So Vox Phantasma, swinging on the rope, hurls that fireball from the underside of the caterpillar, fires your gun, boom, and just (imitates whomping). Pete is fit. He's been cycling around the city."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: You hop up onto the caterpillar. You're in your fuckin' domain, baby. Let's protect New York."
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Incredible. Ricky Matsui, that's you, baby."
"Zac: Okay, Ricky looks to where Wally is but then also tries to look to see the lay of the land and sees Kingston hanging from the rope-"
Lou: Kingston does not look confident.
Zac: And is gonna run… I think he's gonna take his movement to get to the rope where Kingston's hanging from and just try to make some kind of Athletics check to pull Kingston up.
Brennan: Hell yeah. You're gonna get an attack of opportunity from that one balloon beast there. Is that okay?
Zac: Can I go fully around it? I'm trying to decide if...
"Brennan: Let me see here. So that'd be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 30 would get you to the ankle of the Chompsky's outfielder."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: If you want it, you'd have to cut right past it to get to Kingston in a single movement."
Zac: Okay. I'll do that. That's all right.
"Brennan: Okay. Thing's gonna take a swing. The balloon beast hits Ricky and deals you one… Ricky takes 11 points of piercing damage as this squishy balloon fangs sort of lightly press into your leg, don't feel like they're piercing, but your leg just explodes in blood as it bites you, just (imitates blood spurting)."
Ricky: Ow.
Siobhan: Ugh.
Ricky: You seemed so safe.
(Zac laughs)
Brennan: (chuckles) You make it to next to Kingston. Go ahead and make your Athletics check to pull Kingston up.
(tense music)
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: Oh shit. I just realized something. The balloons are difficult terrain. I'm gonna say, in this instance, that you can make that Athletics check as your free object interaction, but to get to Kingston in that single turn is like a move and another move—"
Zac: Gotcha.
Brennan: On top of it.
Zac: Sheesh. Okay.
Brennan: But go ahead and give me that. Give me that Athletics check.
"Zac: Athletics? Oh, okay, it's 24."
"Brennan: Oh, damn, Kingston, you're holding on, and Ricky… So running here is hard, 'cause you're (imitates precarious running) stepping on balloon to get over here. You arrive, and one-arm hoist Kingston up onto the outfielder."
Zac: Can I put him on my shoulders? (laughs)
"Brennan: (laughing) Yes, you can put Kingston on your shoulders. Absolutely."
Ally: Finally.
"Lou: I put my hands, truly in, like, classic terrified child way, hold Ricky's hand with both of my hands."
Ricky: I got you.
Kingston: You promise? You promise?
"Ricky: I don't know, this feels a little unsafe."
Zac: And I put him down.
"Kingston: Okay. Okay. I hate this. I hate this a lot. But thank you, Mr. March. You're my hero."
Ricky: I'll let you know what the status of the new calendar is when it happens.
(group laughing)
Brennan: Incredible.
Kingston: Great.
Emily: Sofia put in a pre-order.
"Ricky: You can pre-order if you want. I can also just, I'll probably give you guys copies."
"Kingston: No, we'll pay."
"Ricky: If you wanna support, great."
"Kingston: I got money. No, I'm happy to pay. I'm assuming the money goes to Helping Hands, so you know."
"Ricky: Yeah, yeah, 100% of some proceeds, yeah."
"Brennan: Incredible, so Ricky, Ricky and Kingston are now over on the right foot of the Chompsky's outfielder."
(Lou chuckles)
"Brennan: And oh boy. Cool. One sword, balloon sword clown, rushes to close with Pete. Another has to make an Athletics check to get up to Bruina Bearheart. I'm gonna roll in front, 'cause this is huge. On a one through five, if this clown rolls low enough, because Pete shot the Nutcracker, it will miss the cord and fall on a one through five. And then it needs a… Hold on, it needs a 12 or higher to actually make it to the wing. Anything between that 12 and that 5, it is going to just grab onto the cord. Here comes its d20."
(suspenseful music)
(Siobhan inhales sharply)
Brennan: Nat 20.
Murph: Ugh.
(group groaning)
Ally: Damn.
Lou: Damn.
Brennan: The clown leaps to the wing and closes with Sofia.
Emily: I could take a little damage.
(Brennan and Ally laugh)
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: This absolute masochist.
"Emily: (laughs) Just sayin', it kinda makes me stronger, you know?"
(Ally chuckles)
"Brennan: Absolutely misses Sofia, (laughs) 100% misses. Oh my god. (disappointed parent voice) I just rolled two twos. You can't have three of you die and then roll bad."
(group laughing)
"Brennan: Guys, come on, get it together. Yeah, that's the melee clowns' turn."
Murph: These clowns are clowns.
Brennan: These clowns are clowns.
"Lou: True clowns, dude."
Ally: These are true clowns.
Zac: True clowns.
"Brennan: Okay, we're going to roll a death save for Santa Claus."
(Box of Doom music)
Murph: Oh no!
Lou: What?
Ally: What?
Siobhan: Wow.
"Brennan: Here we go, rolling the d20 in front of the board."
"Emily: Okay, I got a plan to get him to you."
Siobhan: I also have a plan to get him.
Brennan: That's a natural one.
(Murph gasps)
Brennan: Two failed death saves for Santa. (laughs and claps his hands)
"Lou: Don't fuckin' clap, you fuckin' monster. Put your damn-"
Ally: Oh no.
"Lou: Put your hands together, and lean back."
Murph: Slam your head into your desk.
"Brennan: Wally Claus is goin',"
"Wally: Ah, I don't feel too good."
Ally: No!
Brennan: Up on top of Bruina and perilously sort of rolls around on the flying balloon. Wow. What were the odds? I guess one in 20.
(Ally sighs)
Lou: Stop. Stop this. Your tone is clear.
"Ally: Yeah, let's just talk about the odds. (chuckles)"
"Brennan: Iga, that is your turn."
"Siobhan: Okay. Let me know if you will let me do this, because there's some language that's a little unclear. So Sanctuary Vessel, when I enter the chest, I can bring five willing creatures with me."
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: But can I leave them in the chest?
Brennan: Can you bring—
"Siobhan: Or do I have to… I think that there's a way for me to actually… Kingston's on the Chompsky's thing now, right?"
Brennan: Correct. Yes.
"Lou: Oh, yes, apology."
"Siobhan: Okay. This is, I think, what I wanna do. Tell me if it will work."
Brennan: Okay.
"Siobhan: So I'd like to fly up to, like here. (on the Bruina bear) So I'll take the opportunity attack."
Brennan: Awesome.
Siobhan: I'd like to cast Galder's Speedy Courier.
Brennan: Okay.
"Siobhan: Put the chest into Galder's Speedy Courier, so I summon an air elemental that will transport the chest. And in that, as a bonus action, pull me and Wally into the chest and send it to Kingston."
"Brennan: Oh shit. Okay. Yes. This is all doable. Hold on. So you fly. Who are you getting the attack of opportunity from, real quick?"
Siobhan: There's this clown between me and Pete.
Brennan: Oh gosh.
Siobhan: This freaking clown between me and Pete.
Ally: That clown's attacking me.
"Brennan: Yes, so it's gonna get a swing on you."
"(spooky, mysterious music)"
Brennan: That is a hit.
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: I am going to need… We're gonna roll real quick to see here. Ooh, some goofy stuff's about to happen."
Ally: Oh no.
"Brennan: Iga, you take 11 points of chaos damage, and I'm gonna need a Charisma saving throw from you."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Lou: Motherfucker, did you just say chaos damage?"
"Ally: Yeah, exactly."
Siobhan: I got a 24.
Brennan: (saluting the camera with double peace signs) Chaos damage.
Siobhan: I got a 24.
Murph: Whoa.
"Brennan: 24\. Iga, Pete, you see that this… As Iga turns to leave, this clown whips round, hits Iga with this balloon sword, same thing of, it doesn't.. It goes like, thump. And as it thumps harmlessly into Iga, that part of her body just explodes and ruptures with blood, just, (imitates blood spurting) the clown goes—"
"Iga: Hey, what do you think you're doing? Don't you can touch me."
"Brennan: And Iga resists a Wild Magic Surge that she would have undergone, rolling twice and taking the less favorable result."
Siobhan: Woof. Okay.
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: Awesome. So Iga, looking at this ability, as an action, you can magically vanish into your vessel, which remains in the space you left, and yeah. And then I'm trying to see..."
"Siobhan: So, I mean-"
Brennan: Sanctuary Vessel-
Siobhan: I can just be in there with Wally. It's fine. I can just go over to Kingston as well.
Brennan: I'm actually down with this shenanigans. I dig it.
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: So you cast Speedy Courier. And do you need to be near people?
"Siobhan: It's within 30 feet, which I am, if I move up to where Sofia is."
Brennan: Okay. Rad. So you cast the Courier spell. Look up the speed of an air elemental for me to see how much movement this thing is gonna have.
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: So on your turn, you and Wally can both disappear into the chest."
"Emily: I could also, I mean, I'm very, very… I have really good movement. So if your air elemental isn't fast enough, then I could-"
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, then I could just-"
Emily: —transport you both.
Siobhan: —give you the chest.
Emily and Siobhan: Yeah.
Emily: And then you could maybe—
Ally: Incredible.
Emily: —save that spell slot if you want.
"Brennan: So I'll say, also, Iga, your turn is gonna be going into this… Is it a bonus action for you to summon that elemental?"
"Siobhan: No, the spell is an action, and the going into the box is bonus action."
"Brennan: Cool, so I'm gonna say this, go ahead, look up the stats for your air elemental, and roll."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I mean, air elementals have a 90-foot flying sphere."
"Emily: Oh, 90-foot, yeah. That's really fast."
"Brennan: That's fast as hell. So Iga, go ahead and be so kind to roll initiative for the air elemental that will now enter initiative."
Siobhan: Okay.
Ally: Whoa.
Brennan: But you and Wally both vanish.
"Siobhan: I rolled a 5, and their Dex is plus five, so 10."
"Brennan: 10, cool. We are not at 10 yet. Iga and Wally Claus both vanish. (energy whooshing) Moving down the initiative order, now these bow-and-arrow clowns are gonna go. Well, they can't kill Santa Claus 'cause Santa Claus is in a magic box."
"Ally: Great job, Siobhan. Jesus."
(Siobhan exhales in relief)
"Lou: What's up, dude?"
"Iga: I cannot have Santa Claus die in front of my children. I know they're a little bit old, but still, I can no, no, absolutely not."
"Brennan: Amazing. Okay. Let's see here. One, two."
Brennan is measuring ranges from numerous true clowns to the PCs.
Lou: What are you doing?
"Murph: Stop, dude."
Lou: What are you doing?
Murph: He's fuckin' at it.
"Siobhan: What are you fuckin' doin', dude?"
Zac: Tell us. Tell us what you're doing.
"Lou: What's up, dude? You made up chaos damage, and now you're just mad 'cause we're fuckin' gonna save Santa Claus."
"Siobhan: He's fuckin' makin' this whole shit up, dude. None of this is real. You're just makin' it up."
Lou: More fuckin' homebrew shit.
Zac: This is all made up. Brennan's just a liar.
"Lou: Here we go again, dude."
"Siobhan: It's fake, bros."
"Murph: You're just fuckin' makin' shit up, dude."
Siobhan: It's fuckin' fake.
"Ally: If there was gonna be a cast tattoo, it would be the words true clown."
(group laughing)
"Ally: I mean, we all know that."
Emily: And it would all be chest. It would all be one of those Harley chest ones.
"Siobhan: This absolute nightmare, just on the neck."
Murph: We're all just juggalos.
Siobhan: True clown.
Ally: True clown.
"Ally indicates their hands where a knuckle tattoo would be. “Clown” has too many letters, so they include the thumb."
(group laughing)
Brennan: Amazing. Amazing.
"Zac pretends to show off a knuckle tattoo. Ally follows suit, but with one hand awkwardly curled to also show the thumb."
"Emily: Yeah, that was good."
"Brennan: And Siobhan, go ahead and tell me the range on Speedy Courier, like where can you create it?"
"Siobhan: I mean, it's a 20 by 20 foot chest, but I don't know. Let me see, sorry."
"Brennan: Oh, no. Where can you summon that air elemental, is what I'm asking."
"Siobhan: Oh, okay let me… Sorry, I was just… I didn't write the whole thing on my card 'cause it's like eight paragraphs. Oh, it's a 10-foot range."
"Brennan: 10-foot, okay, so within 10 feet of you is where that air elemental appears. Awesome, so Pete, I am going to need the following saving throws from you."
"(low, dark, threatening music)"
"Brennan: I'm going to need a Constitution saving throw, two Wisdom saving throws, and three Charisma saving throws."
Ally: What?
"Brennan: All of the clowns flying with their own little groups of balloons one-handed fire short bows with this crazy sleight of hand. Pete gets hit with six different brightly-colored balloon arrows. So go ahead and give me the Constitution throw first, Pete."
"Ally: Okay, really quick, I think I have advantage against one of these."
"Brennan: Yeah, you have advantage on the two Wisdom saving throws."
"Ally: Okay, so I'm rolling you a Con save, two Wisdom saves, and what else?"
"Brennan: And three Charisma, so go ahead and roll the Con first."
Ally: Christ. I guess I'll just do these all on the board.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
(Box of Doom music)
"Ally: Okay, here is my Con save."
Ally rolls a 4.
(group groaning)
Ally: Interesting.
"Siobhan: Interesting, interesting."
Ally: Interesting. So that's-
Emily: Don't you have luck points though?
Ally: That's a 10.
"Emily: Oh, no, you have Bend Luck."
"Brennan: Pete, you take 21 points of chaos damage (imitates explosion booming) as one of the arrows just blows up a chunk of your… Like, skin and flesh from your… Your ribs are exposed through."
"Lou makes a face of abject horror, throwing his hands up."
Brennan: (imitates explosion booming) Go ahead and roll your first Wisdom saving throw for me. And this one you roll with advantage.
"Ally: Okay, so here's Wisdom. (they roll a 15 and 13) Eyy. Okay. And my Wisdom is just a plus one, so it's 16."
"Brennan: That is a success. Go ahead and roll your next Wisdom saving throws, this one with advantage as well."
Ally: Yes. Nat 20.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, now I'm gonna need… These are not with advantage. I'm gonna need three Charisma saving throws."
(suspenseful music)
"Ally rolls a 12, a 20, and a 7."
"Ally: Oh. Okay, and then my Charisma is plus nine. So that's 21."
Brennan: So the lowest-
Ally: Nat 20. The lowest is a 16.
Brennan: 16?
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Three of the bright red arrows that they fire, you guys see, are them trying to create a Wild Magic Surge within Pete. Pete, three attempts were made to blow you up and rip a portal open between dream and the waking world."
Ally: They can use me to create a portal?
"Brennan: Yeah, they're trying to have you surge so powerfully that you just rip a hole, and the world's open."
"Ally: (whispering) Okay, interesting."
"Brennan: But you hold on to it. Those are Charisma saving throws, which you're good at. I mean, it's the same muscle that you use to deal with wild magic in general."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: That is the ranged clowns. Kingston, that is your turn."
"Lou: Oh, wow. There's a lot goin' on."
(Ally and Lou laugh)
Ally: So tired.
"Lou: I mean, I would-"
"Ally: Whew, I'm on this balloon."
"Lou: I'm just an old man on a balloon. Like, truly, I don't think I've let go of Ricky yet. I think I'm still like… There's one hand just on his bicep, just for balance."
Ricky: I got you.
"Kingston: Thank you. Hey, Ricky, are you uh, are we gonna, (stammering) we gonna move? Or are we just gonna… Are we stayin' here on the Chompsky balloon?"
"Ricky: I was about to vault into the next balloon, but whatever makes sense to you."
Kingston: (groans) Okay.
"Sofia: Kingston, I think you can stay there, and we can try and find a way to stabilize that balloon for you."
"Kingston: Okay, great, great. I love that. Okay."
(Emily laughs)
Kingston: I am going to… Yeah. Yeah.
"Zac: Are they coming here? Can we hold our turns for the… I don't know if that makes sense, but—"
"Lou: I think there's one thing I wanna do. How far is Pete away from me, given everything, Brennan? According to the ruler, he's 30 feet, but I don't know if that, with regard to altitude—"
"Brennan: So he's about, that would put him about 45 feet away."
"Lou: Okay. Oh, is there any way for me to get… Is there any way for me to get closer that doesn't involve me walking off of this fuckin' Chompsky balloon?"
"Brennan: You know, it's funny you mention it, Lou. There is no way for you to get closer without jumping."
(Lou sighs heavily)
"Brennan: You see that there is that big gold star balloon that is in between the Chompsky's outfielder and the tail of the caterpillar. If you wanted to make a jump for it, you could."
"Ally: Oh my god, Kingston."
Both Ally and Lou are facepalming.
"Siobhan: Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm."
Lou: Is that just an Athletics check or—
"Brennan: It's just a raw Athletics check. And honestly, because of its altitude and where it's at, it's only a DC 10 Athletics check."
"Lou: Yeah, but I only get a plus one to the roll. So if I miss, I fall."
"Zac: If you go before me, I could probably, I could try something with you."
"Lou: Okay, I wanna Bless Pete is the thing, but I… It's just, it just feels too dangerous. Okay, Kingston is straight-up too scared to jump. And instead I'm gonna cast a third-level Enhance Ability on me and Ricky."
(mystical tones chiming)
Zac: Ooh.
Lou: To give us advantage on… We'll take Cat's Grace today. That's the flavor of the day.
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: We'll take a little Cat's Grace, or no, Ricky, you use Strength, right?"
Emily: The grace of Garfield.
Zac: I use Strength.
Murph: Is that Garfield?
"Lou: Okay, great."
Zac: Mostly.
"Lou: Then it's gonna be, we'll do Bull's Strength instead. So, I mean, unless Brennan… Yeah, it doesn't matter."
Brennan: Beautiful.
"Lou: We'll do third-level Bull's Strength. Yeah, just, I put my hands on Ricky, and I'm just like,"
"Kingston: Okay, we're gonna be okay, right?"
"Ricky: Nothing will ever happen to you, Kingston."
Kingston: (roars)
"Lou: And with that, I cast third-level Bull's Endurance. So we both have advantage on Strength checks. And if you would like to, Mr. March, your carrying capacity has doubled. So I don't wanna ask to be carried, but you theoretically do now have the strength to do so."
"Brennan: You see Kingston extends his hand, and Ricky, you feel the strength of all the New Yorkers screaming down below at the escaping balloons, pointing up. All of them that are wishing and hoping that they could lend their strength to the people that have gotten carried off into the sky through Kingston are able to. When I say that you have the strength of 10 men, you and Kingston truly have the strength of like 10 people down on the ground right now, lending you their strength."
Ricky: Thank you.
(Brennan laughs)
Zac: I guess Ricky just feels the strength of these New Yorkers coursing through him.
Brennan: Cool. Anything else from Kingston?
"Lou: Nah, just the knowledge that nothing bad is ever gonna happen to us."
"Brennan: Incredible. Iga, now your air elemental goes."
"Siobhan: The air elemental will just use their full movement to get to Kingston. I mean, that's—"
Emily: 180 feet.
"Siobhan: Hang on. Yeah, it's like… So the air elemental would be where I placed it, not where Wally was."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: Because it's 10 feet of
"me, not 10 feet of Wally."
Brennan: Copy that.
"Siobhan: So it's 90 feet, but I'll just go in between Pete and Cody to avoid that opportunity attack."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: So like a little—
"Brennan: Yeah, the air elemental takes a double, takes a move and a Dash action, but ends its turn."
Siobhan: And then ends by Kingston and just spits out this box at him.
"Brennan: So Kingston, you are now holding the box. And actually, I'm just realizing, would it… 'Cause I believe, actually, I am wrong. The air elemental does go before Kingston. If you had had the box, would you have done your turn differently?"
"Lou: Probably, because I would have… Yeah, I probably would've have done something with them. I would have assumed the box was a more pressing priority than getting anywhere else."
"Brennan: Okay, in that case, I'm gonna say that you cast Bull's Strength, and because that was an initiative slip-up on my part, you have a bonus action, holding the box right now, with your free object interaction left."
"Lou: Okay, I can't go into it without Iga, right?"
Siobhan: No.
Brennan: Correct.
"Lou: Okay, but I know that Iga and Wally are in here, So I just..."
"Kingston: Okay, Ricky, go on without me. I'm gonna stay here and wait for Iga to do whatever she wants to do next."
Ricky: Okay. I don't know what to do. (laughs)
Kingston: Me neither.
"Lou: I would like to… I can't ready a bonus action, right? Or can I?"
Brennan: Give me a Medicine check.
"Lou: Great, great, great."
Brennan: Call it a DC 20 Medicine check.
Lou: That won't do it. That's gonna be a 14.
"Brennan: Brutal. Yeah, you're looking at a little magic box in your hand that an air elemental just dropped off here."
(Ally laughs)
"Lou: Great, then I just take a knee and be at the ready."
"Brennan: Cool, cool. Cody, that is your turn."
"Murph: Sweet. Do I have to properly climb the rope all the way up these little things? Or can I go straight up? Like, can I go up one if I do my thing? Or do I have to go like, boop, boop, boop?"
"Brennan: So this is all difficult terrain, right?"
Murph: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: But you still need to give me an Athletics check to get up onto the caterpillar.
"Murph: Can I get help from Misiek, Iga?"
Brennan: Sure. Yeah.
Murph: Thank you. I built Cody to be a shithead.
(Siobhan and Ally laugh)
Murph: And he’s not an athlete. Sweet. That's an 18.
"Brennan: You get up there, no worries."
"Murph: Sweet. Can I go straight up, like that?"
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
"Murph: Okay, great. Oh boy, and then this is all difficult terrain, so I can really only move like 15 feet, but I can go one, two, yeah, okay. I can go one, and then go diagonally, and then go up here."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: So I'm gonna go up here. And... I think Cody is juggalo-adjacent.
(Siobhan laughs)
Murph: So he is horrified that these false clowns are calling themselves true clowns.
Murph: ‘Cause they're not actually down with the clown.
(Brennan laughs)
Murph: And it's gonna go ahead and let's… (laughs)
"Cody: I'm gonna go all out, just this once."
Lou shakes his head in exasperation.
"Murph: I'm gonna do Thunderous Smite as a bonus action, and then we'll go ahead and make an attack."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: That is a 17.
Brennan: A 17 hits.
"Murph: Sweet. And then I will go all out, just this once. I'm gonna do—"
Zac: Just this once.
"Murph: A third-level, or actually, I guess I'll do a second level twice, but always just this once."
(Ally laughs)
"Murph: Okay, so a second-level would be 4d8? 3d8?"
Brennan: Second level is three d8.
Murph: 3d8.
"Cody: Sword art, juggalo style."
(Brennan laughs)
"Zac: Because of everything happening, Ricky really wishes he couldn't have heard that, but he did hear that."
"Murph: (laughs) I scream it directly at Ricky 'cause I know we're sword buddies. Uh, 37 damage."
Brennan: 37 damage?
Murph: Yeah.
(Ally whistles)
Brennan: You lay into this clown. It is massively injured.
Murph: Okay.
(Brennan exhales forcefully)
(sword thudding)
"Murph: Once again, gonna go all out just this once."
Ally: Oh yeah?
Cody: Sword art.
Ally: Once again?
Cody: Juggalo style two.
Murph: That's a 26.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
(Lou rolls tongue)
Murph: And-
Siobhan: Nice.
"Murph: Just to make sure it dies, I'll do a first-level Divine Smite."
"Brennan: Cool, cool."
Ally: We see you take out a little Faygo. (mimes drinking)
(group laughing)
Cody: That's how I know they're not true clowns.
Lou: Where's your Faygo?
Siobhan: Where is your Faygo now?
(group laughing)
Murph: That would actually be a great alternative to this Gladiator bullshit that's going on.
Zac: That would be a sick mug to drink Faygo out of.
"Ally: Yeah, dude."
Lou: Woo!
Murph: 26.
Brennan: You decimate this clown here. Go ahead and give me a DC 5 Acrobatics check.
Murph: (snorts) Okay.
Zac: Five?
"Murph: I got a, da-da da, 15."
"Brennan: 15, great."
"Lou: Thank God, Murph."
Brennan: You do not slice the balloon you are on with your massive omnislashes.
(Murph imitates blade whooshing)
(Brennan laughs)
"Cody: The blade is controlled. Sword art, careful blade."
Lou: Oh my gosh.
(Murph laughs)
Brennan: Incredible. (moving a balloon dog) One.
"Siobhan: This is a horrible dog. Kill this dog, this dog."
"Lou: Also, Pete just has a big chunk missing out of him."
"Pete: (groans) My chest. Yeah, I've been cut in the chest before."
Kingston: No!
Pete: Don't worry. I healed up. I still have plenty of Arnica left at my house.
Brennan: We're gonna make a similar roll for this other balloon beast here.
(Ally whistles)
Brennan: Needs a six or higher. That's a four.
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: This balloon beast goes to leap off the Nutcracker, but the Nutcracker has descended enough. The balloon beast, (woofs) but because these are blown up with breath and not helium—"
Ally: Oh no.
Brennan: The balloon beast just slowly starts descending to the ground.
Zac: (dramatically) No!
(Brennan barks)
"Brennan: Yeah, good lookin' out on that Nutcracker. That balloon beast can't get up to the rest of the fight. The rest will be-"
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: taking their attacks, however. Okay, one attacking Ricky is gonna roll with advantage. Natural two and a natural one. Guys, when you're on the ropes, ya need to be rolling better than this. Cody, you haven't taken any damage, right?"
Murph: No.
"Brennan: Okay, that's still gonna be a hit. This one's gonna roll for Pete, nat 20 on Pete."
Siobhan: Oof.
Lou: Boo!
Siobhan: Bend that luck.
Zac: Is that one the one above him or the one below him that got the nat 20?
"Brennan: One below him. Cody, you take 18 points of chaos damage."
Cody: I am chaos.
"Brennan: (laughs) And for dear Pete the Plug… Hold on one second. Pete, you take… 10… 16… You take 20 points of chaos damage, Pete. (snarls)"
"Zac: For the one that hit Cody, even though I kind of don't want to, I will use my Channel Divinity to Rebuke the Violent and make it take that same amount of radiant damage if it fails to save."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Cody: Nice one, Ricky, sword art, combo blade."
Ricky: It's not exactly a sword art.
Murph: (laughs) True.
"Zac: It's a DC 16 Wisdom save. On a fail, they take half."
"Brennan: Oh, on a fail, they take half. Or, no, on a success, they take half, right? And then on-"
"Zac: Oh yeah, on a fail, they take equal to the damage. On a success, they take half. Yeah, I flipped it."
Brennan: A full 20 points of radiant damage to that balloon beast. (screeches) What does Ricky say to rebuke this violent balloon beast?
"Ricky: Simmer down, dog."
"Brennan: (snarling and barking) Light gleams in its eyes. It deflates a little bit. That's going to be back to the top, Sofia Lee."
"Emily: Okay, where are the three… So when the other creatures attack, they don't force the Wild Magic Surge, but these ones with the arrows do. Are there still three of them? I'm trying to find the third one."
"Zac: It's off to the right of the Chompsky's, I think. Yeah."
Brennan: There's a flying one to the right of the Chompsky's outfielder. There's one way up above the caterpillar.
Emily: Are they all within range of Pete still?
"Brennan: They are all, they all appear to have a long range with those bows."
"Emily: Okay, then you know what,"
"Sofia: Kingston, are you cool if I stabilize your balloon later?"
Kingston: Yeah. Nothin' bad's ever gonna happen to us.
"Sofia: Oh, okay. That's a good motto."
Emily: I think I'm gonna just—
Ally: He's screaming at a new octave.
Emily: I think I'm gonna-
"Lou: (laughs, yelling in a higher voice) Yeah, nothing's-"
Emily: —dive off and attack one of these bow-and-arrow guys.
Zac: (impressed) Ooh.
"Brennan: Holy shit. Okay, this one's way up there. I'm gonna say that this is a… Go ahead."
"Emily: Since I have my… I'm 35 feet from here. I'm jumping, I have Jump on me, my jump is crazy. Do I still need, like, a Step of the Wind or-"
"Brennan: You have Jump active on you, so it's within range. I'm gonna need an Acrobatics check. Yeah, because even though it's within your jump, you have to nail it just right to hit these clowns. So this is gonna be a DC 20 Acrobatics check."
Emily: DC 20 Acrobatics.
Lou: Let's go.
Emily: Okay.
Lou: Let's go.
"Emily: Yes, bitch, 26!"
"Brennan: (laughs) Sofia, you do the full, like this… Are you going to disengage from the melee clown next to you, by the way?"
"Emily: No, I'm gonna let him hit me if he wants."
"Brennan: Okie dokie. So let's resolve that first. Let's see if this bozo, no pun intended, hits."
Lou: Boo.
Ally: Freakin' bozo over here.
Zac: I just feel like it was intended.
"Emily: Come on, bozo, just try to hit me."
"Brennan: Sofia, you take 15, you take 20 points of chaos damage."
Emily: Shield.
(energy reverberating)
"Brennan: Well, you don't, nothin' fuckin' happens."
(group laughing)
Brennan: So you—
"Emily: I want the damage, but the Wild Magic Surge could complicate things, so I'm gonna be responsible."
"Brennan: Yes. Good call. You throw the shield up. This guy comes, and the neon cat paws of La Gran Gata surround your fists."
Emily: Swat ‘em away.
"Brennan: Boom. Block the balloon sword. You backflip, like go cannonball to hit your butt into the balloon and, boom, soar off. And you see this clown,"
Clown: (chuckles maniacally) Uh-oh!
"Brennan: As you, bam, slam perfectly into this flying clown. Go ahead and take your actions and bonus actions."
Emily: Okay. My first attack on him is going to be a 21 to hit. Does it?
"Brennan: 21 hits. Yes, absolutely."
Emily: Okay.
Lou: Yep.
"Emily: Only rolled a one, but that's six damage, and I'm gonna Stunning Strike."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Let's see if this dude is stunned. Completely stunned, yep."
"Emily: Great, so then now I'm going to Step of the Wind to get to the other one."
Lou: Woo.
Murph: Whoa.
Emily: To get to the other one.
Lou: Doctor.
Brennan: Oh my fucking god.
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: So you dealt six damage to that clown.
"Emily: Uh-huh, six damage and stunned 'em, and then I'm..."
Brennan: Bonus action—
Emily: I wanna Step of the Wind.
Brennan: Step of the Wind.
"Emily: Yeah, bonus action Dash."
Brennan: Bonus action Dash.
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: Does that cover it, 'cause how much movement is that? It's 30-"
Emily: My movement? I'm 90 feet of movement.
"Murph: So a Dash is just your movement, right?"
Brennan: Right.
Murph: 'Cause a Dash and a movement—
"Emily: Oh, I thought a Dash was double your—"
"Brennan: It effectively doubles by adding just another 45. So like, with your movement and a Dash, you can go 90."
"Emily: Oh, okay, well, can I… So Step of the Wind wouldn't get me there with my triple jump or anything like?"
"Brennan: Step of the Wind, let me double-check here, I think, is only gonna make you have 90 feet of movement to work with in the round. I think that's correct."
Zac: I think that sounds right to me.
"Brennan: Yeah, this-"
"Emily: Okay. Then I guess I'll use the rest of my movement. So that guy's stunned now, and I guess I'll just jump down to attack one of these dogs that's in the fray. 'Cause it looks like, I don't think I could get to any of the other archers then with my movement."
Brennan: Cool. Awesome.
"Emily: And then use… And now I'm not using Step of the Wind, so I could actually-"
Brennan: Get another attack.
Emily: I could actually get my other attack on this guy. Does a 17 hit the dog?
"Brennan: A 17 does, yes."
"Emily: Okay, again I rolled a one, so that's six damage. I'm gonna try to Stunning Strike the dog."
Brennan: Dog is stunned.
"Emily: Okay, and then I'm going to Flurry of Blows on this other dog."
(Brennan laughs)
Murph: Stop (indistinct) the dogs.
Emily: That's definitely gonna hit. That's a 26. Hit him for eight. Gonna try to Stunning Strike him.
Brennan: Stunned.
"Emily: Okay. Now I have one more hit. Can I hit the one I stunned, just 'cause why not?"
Brennan: Why not?
"Zac: The top one's pretty damaged, I think."
"Emily: The top? Okay, so I'll go back to the top one then. That is a 21 to hit. So I'll hit him for another eight damage. So now both those dogs and the other guy are stunned till the end of my next turn."
Lou: What a fuckin' turn.
Brennan: How much damage did you do to which dog on that last attack?
"Emily: So the top dog, (laughs)"
Murph imitates multiple punches and elbow hits.
"Emily: I did eight damage and six damage. The bottom dog, I did eight damage."
Brennan: Okay.
"Emily: The archer, I did six damage, but more importantly-"
Brennan: And all three of them—
Emily: I stunned all three.
Brennan: —are stunned until the end of your next turn.
Emily: Yeah.
Lou: That's some monk shit.
"Emily: I did use four ki points, but-"
Brennan: Absolutely.
Zac: That's the most successful Stunning Strike turn I've ever seen.
Siobhan: Yes.
Lou: That's incredible.
Ally: Yes.
"Emily: I was thinking these, they're balloon animals. I was like, they can't have good Constitution."
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: You guys see Sofia… This fight was made for Sofia, who's just, (grunts) bam! In your kick to stun that archer, it is a perfectly executed kick to also be you jumping. It's just like, bam, and you're already sailing to the caterpillar, moving in between the dogs. (rolls tongue) Wild."
"Ally: If she stunned that archer who's kind of just in mid air, does that mean, like-"
Emily: Yeah.
Ally: They can't-
Emily: I was kind of wondering.
"Brennan: You see that his fist is still wrapped around those balloons, but he's hanging there limply in the air."
"Emily: Okay, okay. But he won't be able to use this movement, so he might get out of range though."
Brennan: Absolutely. He might get out of range.
"Emily: Also, he's stunned anyways."
"Brennan: Yes, he is stunned."
Emily: So he can't hit you.
"Brennan: Pete, that is gonna be your turn."
Ally: Okay. I would like to try to get to the propeller of Bear Amelia Earhart.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: (laughs) Why?
"Ally: It's 15, (laughs) I just wanna… It looks cool. No. It's 15 feet away. Can I make that jump? Is that something that Pete can do?"
Brennan: That's a 30-foot jump. It's something that's Sofia can do. Pete would need some form of magic to get up there.
"Ally: Oh, that's a 30-foot jump. Fuck."
"Brennan: Yeah, 'cause I know it… But the altitude puts that bear way the hell up there."
"Ally: Yeah, for sure. Dang. I was trying to get in a spot to cast a really good cone spell."
Zac and Lou nod. Lou gives an “ok” sign.
Brennan: Copy that.
"Ally: But, so instead, these two dogs are stunned, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yes, that is correct."
"Emily: So you do have advantage on any kind of attack that you would do on them, but that doesn't affect area of effect though."
"Ally: Okay. Yeah, okay, then I am going to just move to other side of these dogs,"
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: And they don't get attack opportunities, right?"
Brennan: Nope.
Ally: Right.
Brennan: They're fully stunned.
Emily: 'Cause they're stunned.
"Ally: Cool, so I'm just gonna turn that way and cast Cone of Cold on both of them—"
Brennan: (sucks in a breath) Hell yeah.
"Ally: And use Careful Spell to not hit, you know, Cody or Sofia."
Brennan: Cody or Sofia or the balloons.
"Ally: Or the balloon, yeah, or my sweet butterfly."
Brennan: Hell yes.
Lou: Or my sweet butterfly.
"Emily: Luna, who we just now—"
Ally: Luna.
Emily: —how many episodes in—
"Lou: Luna, the moon?"
Emily: —learn is named Luna. (laughs)
Brennan: Hell yes. Go ahead and roll your damage.
"Ally: Hell yeah. All right. 42, baby."
Brennan: These would still be alive if they had each… I rolled two 12s. They needed two 13s. So both of these beasts are dead.
Siobhan: Yes!
Ally: Oh my god!
"Brennan: Cleaning up, bam. (imitates explosion booming)"
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: You see that the magic of Santa Claus suffused in this place. This Cone of Cold is pure, giant snowflakes. It's like, (imitates wind whooshing). It's just all snowflake patterns, (imitates spell whizzing) comes out of Pete's hands."
"Ally: Can I send Luna? I don't know how the magic of the box works, and I don't really know what's up with Wally, but can I send Luna to go land on the box and try to give Wally a Help action in his death saving throws?"
"Brennan: Hell yes, you may."
Murph: Oh.
"Brennan: I think Luna just perfectly… You are the Vox Phantasma. This is your city. Extra-dimensional spaces within this place are open to you. Luna flits in through the… By the way, part of the reason Luna has such an easy time getting into this heavily warded box is because of the raw Umbra that already leaked in there and corroded a hole. (imitates air whooshing)"
Ally: Oh shit.
Brennan: Luna gets in. And Wally will roll the next save with advantage.
Ally: Awesome. Cool.
Brennan: Incredible. That is Pete's turn.
(Lou sighs)
"Brennan: Ricky, that's you. I think you are also aware that you are the last person in an initiative to go before Wally."
"Ally: Oh, sick."
Zac: I am?
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: Okay.
"Ally: Oh, I totally forgot, but during my turn, when I'm killing those two dogs, I turn to Cody, and I just have so many shitty tattoos that I show him I have a hatchet tattoo."
(Ally and Brennan laugh)
Cody: Whoa. Hell yeah.
"Ally: I'm like,"
"Pete: Hocus-pocus, brother."
Zac: Just a hatchet.
(group laughing)
Zac: Do we have to roll wild magic? (immediately regretful) I shouldn't have fuckin' said it.
"Brennan: Oh, do it. Yeah. Give me a wild magic. This one's one or two."
Ally: I appreciate your honesty.
Murph: And this is for—
Ally: 15.
Murph: For showing the hatchet.
(group laughing)
"Brennan: Now it's one, two, three."
Murph: This is pure juggalo power.
"Ally: Any time we talk juggalo, I have to roll wild magic."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Now it is one, two, and three. Hell yeah."
Ally: (whistles) All right.
"Zac: I can't get into that box, though, right?"
Siobhan shakes her head.
Zac: Can I make some kind of check to see if I could?
"Brennan: You cannot get into the box, but it's possible that some of your magic could."
Ally: Hmm.
"Zac: Hmm. In that case, could I just Lay on Hands through the box?"
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: Give me a… I'm gonna make this… This is a hard thing to do because you don't have actual contact with the body. Ricky is in a rockier place than I think he's ever been before. And even though Kingston's kind of out of his element here on the balloons, the truth is that every one of your companions is kind of doing better than you right now, which is not the speed that Ricky has ever been in. Ricky's gonna try to do something impressive with his magic that he's having these conflicting feelings about. What skill do you think Ricky would associate with him working an act of magic in this moment? What's the skill Ricky would go to here? Like, for Pete, it's Arcana. For different people, it might be Religion or History or Medicine or whatever. What's the skill that Ricky goes to here to try to tap into his magic?"
"Zac: I think it is Medicine, you know. This is a check that's for helping people, and that's… For his training, he can snap back to that Medicine kind of world to just try—"
Brennan: I love that.
Murph: Chest compressions.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: Whoa!
Murph: Pretty good.
"Brennan: And I'm actually gonna say that Luna, I think, is actually gonna give Ricky a Help action here."
Emily: Ooh.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me a Medicine check with advantage, Ricky."
Zac: Okay. This is cocked. Okay. Does a 24 do it?
(Siobhan gasps)
"Brennan: Holy shit! Ricky, you look at the box as Kingston is holding it. Lou, go ahead and give me an insight check for Kingston."
Lou: Oh boy.
"Brennan: And you see this little butterfly dancing around. And Ricky, you know this butterfly can make it into the box. You hold out your hand, and this pure, radiant, and again, it's not that old brash, glorious firefighter magic. It is this softer healing, more understanding, more empathetic light. You understand, seeing the injuries, how Wally's been hurt, and you give this gift, and literally this magic of this helping hand surrounds Luna's green light with your own radiant healing light, and the butterfly flies into the box. Iga, standing on the balcony of the castle with a dying Santa Claus, you see a green butterfly enters, alights on Santa Claus's chest, glows with light, and a perfectly healed Santa Claus goes,"
"Wally: (gasps) Wow, a helping hand of magic from good, good boy Ricky Matsui. We're not in New York. We're in a castle. My name is Santa Claus, (winks exaggeratedly) but it used to be Wa—"
"Iga: Santa Claus,"
Wally: Hey.
Iga: It is so nice to meet you. I also go by a different name for work.
"Wally: Oh, we're lying. Yes, yes, yes, okay."
"Iga: We're lying, yes."
"Brennan: And Ricky, you use your action. You have saved Wally from near certain death."
"Zac: Cool. I gave him 20 points of health, for the record."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Wow.
"Zac: Cool, you know, looks up at the stars or the sky."
"Ricky: It's for you, Kugrash."
Emily: Aww.
"The camera focuses on Murph, who has a huge smile."
Zac: I still have my movement and bonus action?
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: (sighs) Could I leap from here to the gold star and up to Pete? I don't know. I have Bull's Strength going.
"Brennan: Give me an Athletics check. These are within your jumping distance, but you're also carrying Kingston. So I'm gonna—"
Zac: I'm putting Kingston down.
"Brennan: Oh, you're putting Kingston down. Okay. So in that case, go ahead and give me two Athletics checks. You're rolling with advantage."
"Ricky: Yeah, Kingston, are you cool over here if I help Pete?"
"Kingston: Nothin' bad's ever gonna happen to me. Nothing bad is ever gonna happen to me, so—"
Ricky: Hold on to that idea.
"Kingston: You're good, I am—"
Ricky: I do wanna be clear that-
Kingston: It's the only thing I'm thinking.
Ricky: Okay.
Zac: I think Ricky tries to decide if it's worth clarifying what he meant by that. (laughs)
Kingston: Nothin' bad's gonna happen to me.
"Ricky: Never mind, never mind."
"Kingston: Come on, come on now."
"Ricky: Yeah, awesome, awesome."
"Kingston: (dancing) Nothin' bad's gonna happen to me, nothin' bad's gonna happen to me."
"Emily: Wow, he really took to that, huh?"
"Zac: And I'll make those Athletic checks. So the first one, oof, a four and a two. But I'm gonna use a luck point here."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Yeah.
"Zac: And I don't make those with advantage, right, if I just-"
Brennan: No.
: Okay.
Brennan: You just reroll one of them.
"Zac: That's cocked, but it was going to be a 15. That's a 16. So 16 plus 9."
"Brennan: Cool. You make it to the gold star, no problem."
"Zac: Okay, now I'm gonna make the other check. Natural 20."
"Brennan: Hell yes, Ricky, you can bound up right up into the fray with everybody, boom, bouncing off the gold star. Bam, you land on the caterpillar."
"Zac: Cool, and then with my bonus action, I'm gonna cast Sanctuary on Pete."
Brennan: Hell yes.
Emily: Yeah.
"Zac: Which means that they'll have to, you know, take a Wisdom save throw before they target 'em."
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Amazing turn from Ricky. Also, again, a completely non-violent turn, just embracing this new magic. You, boom, heal Santa Claus, leap across, protect Pete. Kingston, what'd you get to that insight check?"
"Lou: Oh, nat 1."
"Brennan: Cool, great."
(Emily laughs)
Brennan: You don't know what the—
Lou: Too busy thinkin' nothin' bad's ever gonna happen to me.
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: Really holdin' onto that.
"Brennan: Amazing. We scoot along now in the initiative order. Are there any melee clowns left? Yes, there are."
"Emily: There's one, but he's a way far up."
"Brennan: He's way far up, but he's gonna take a giant… You guys hear,"
"Clown: (chuckles maniacally) Oh, time to make you weird!"
Brennan: And leaps off.
Ally: (incredulously) What?
"Brennan: And (screams),"
"Emily: He said, ""Let's get weird, Austin."""
Brennan: Dropping from the sky.
Ally: I was just gonna say. (laughs)
Brennan: Double-handed—
Ally: (clown voice) Keep Austin weird.
(group laughing)
"Brennan: You see this clown is going to leap with advantage to… Oh, we have to make a Wisdom save-"
Emily: Has to do a Wisdom save.
Brennan: Against Ricky's—
Zac: DC 16 Wisdom save.
"Brennan: Oh, these guys are not that wise, believe it or not. So it's gonna be, he's gotta roll a 14 or higher. We're gonna roll this in front of the board, 'cause he's gonna have advantage on this attack if he succeeds. Natural three, fails this."
Ally: Aw yeah!
"Siobhan: Sorry, bro."
Zac: But he can choose to attack something else also. It doesn't waste it.
"Brennan: Okay, so, I think the way this is gonna work is Ricky steps in to defend Pete, and so Ricky literally, like, body, gets himself in to protect Pete. That is going to be a hit. With advantage, that's gonna hit Ricky Matsui. You take 13 points of chaos damage, and I'm gonna need a… Oh, you don't even need to roll a saving throw, because a fear effect takes place, and you are totally immune. Or no, are you immune to fear?"
"Zac: I should be immune, I think."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: I'm sorry, I-"
"Brennan: Yes, yes, yes, that's right. That's not Devotion. That's just paladins in general, right? Aura of Courage?"
"Zac: Yes, Aura of Courage I have."
"Brennan: Yeah, cool. You cannot be frightened, so the effect does not work. But you do take that damage. Wally's in the box."
"Murph: Oh, I just realized, Pete being near us is gonna help Pete with saving throws as well."
Emily: Ooh.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Great.
"Siobhan: Oh, right."
Ally: What do you mean?
Zac: You add four to saving throws.
Emily: Flanked by paladins.
"Murph: Auras, yeah."
Emily: They're all gonna have auras that give you bonuses to saving throws.
Siobhan: Can those stack?
Ally: Oh shit.
"Siobhan: If there's two paladins, do you get plus eight?"
Emily: No. I would doubt it.
Zac: No.
"Brennan: No, they do not stack."
"Murph: I would think… Really, why wouldn't it?"
"Zac: I, for some reason, thought it would just be whoever has the better—"
"Brennan: It's whoever has the better saving throw bonus, because otherwise, if you had a party of six paladins—"
Murph: True.
"Brennan: You would be like, oh, we all have plus 30 or whatever."
"Siobhan: Yeah, seems reasonable to me, Brennan, I don't know why you have to be like that."
"Zac: Oh, why don't we do that?"
Brennan: I don't think—
Zac: We should all be paladins.
"Brennan: I will say this, if I'm wrong about this, rules as written, I'm gonna homebrew it different, because I want to, baby."
(group laughing)
Brennan: That don't make no sense. Every party should just be six paladins traveling around.
(Siobhan laughs)
"Brennan: Iga, you are healed for 18 points of damage as Wally Claus looks over and comes up to you and goes,"
"Wally: Oh look, those dang clowns hurt you. That's not nice at all. If they were people, (waggling his finger) they'd be on the naughty list."
"Iga: Thank you, Santa. Do you wanna come out and fight, or do you wanna stay in the box?"
Wally: Sure. Whatever you think is right.
Iga: Whatever you— Are you gonna get hurt again? I don't wanna hurt Santa.
"Wally: Ah, now that they don't have the jump on me, I'm really gonna destroy them if I get a chance."
Iga: Okay. Okay.
"Brennan: Iga, it is your turn."
"Siobhan: Great, so can I step out of the… Stepping, mm… Okay, I'll step out of the box with Wally. So me, Wally, and Kingston are on this foot. And I can fly, so if there's not enough space on the foot, I can just hover next to it."
"Brennan: Hover off the next thing? Yeah, hold on."
Siobhan: I think we gotta—
(Brennan whooping)
"Brennan: Great, and you're hovering right next to him. Is it a bonus action to come out?"
Siobhan: It's a bonus action to come out.
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: And then I think what I'm gonna do, is I'm going to use Misiek to cast Greater Invisibility on Pete."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Whoa.
"Siobhan: So it's a touch spell, so you can use your familiar as long as they're within 100 feet of you to cast a spell that's touch-based on somebody else."
Ally: Whoa.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: I did not know that.
"Siobhan: And so that means that Pete will no longer have opportunity attacks against them, and all of the other attacks will be done with disadvantage."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Misiek casts Greater Invisibility on Pete. (mystical tones chiming) Pete vanishes. Your air elemental goes next.
"Siobhan: Oh, the air elemental is done."
"Brennan: Okay, cool."
"Siobhan: After they delivered the chest, they poof."
Brennan: Okay. That one is still stunned. The other two see Santa Cl—
"Emily: I have a question. Would that one who isn't stunned, would he have line of sight on Pete still, since me and Cody are standing in front of Pete?"
"Brennan: Well, he doesn't have line of sight on Pete at all, 'cause Pete's invisible."
Emily: Right. Cool.
"Brennan: So you see, they, (chuckles maniacally) screaming and upset that they can't see Pete anymore. One of them, I think, is gonna take a shot at Iga. And can the other one hit Iga? No, so it's gonna actually go for Cody."
(Zac groans)
Cody: Fuck.
"Brennan: So for Iga, I'm gonna need two saving throws from you. I will first need a Wisdom and then a Constitution saving throw."
"Siobhan: Okay. Mm, Wisdom, I rolled a 6. I'm gonna use a luck point. Okay, that's 21."
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: And then Constitution, (groans) I'm gonna use another luck point. That was another six. Mm, a 10."
Brennan: Okay. So you're out of luck points and you—
"Siobhan: I have one more luck point, but I'll save it."
"Brennan: Okay, gotcha."
Siobhan: 'Cause I'm at full health.
"Brennan: Gotcha, gotcha. You take 21 points of chaos damage. (imitates magic whizzing) But you succeed on your Wisdom saving throw. Cody, I am gonna need… Oh, are you also immune to fear effects?"
Murph: Yes.
Zac: And he's also within 10 feet of me too.
Brennan: Hell yeah. So I'm gonna need a Wisdom saving throw from Cody.
"Murph: Okay, luckily I'm proficient in them, because Cody's not wise."
(Zac and Ally chuckle)
"Murph: (sighs) Ooh, natural 19, that is a 25."
Ally: Oh yeah.
"Brennan: You pass all of the effects of these various arrows. That moves on from the clowns. Kingston, that's you."
"Lou: Iga, what are you at?"
"Siobhan: Oh, I'm good. I'm at 66 out of 87."
Lou: Great. Kingston's gonna cast a second-level Command. Is the second archer clown within 60 feet of me?
"Brennan: Let me check, bearing for altitude. Yes, even with altitude, right within 60 feet."
"Lou: Great, I'm gonna look at the balloon beast and the archer clown to just say,"
Kingston: Down!
Lou: And cast a DC 17.
Brennan: And those are both Wisdom saves?
Lou: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: Ooh. Okay. That is a failure. That is a failure. Both of them fail.
Lou: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: I'm gonna roll a Luck check. 'Cause “down” could be interpreted in a couple of different ways. Kingston, you want an 11 or higher here."
Lou: Okay.
Ally: God damnit.
"Lou: I'll take it, I'll take it."
"Brennan: 13\. As you say down, the clown's own sense of humor betrays it, and it goes, (chuckles maniacally) lets go of its own balloons and plummets to the earth at your down command."
Emily: Ooh.
Brennan: But the other dog just heels.
Lou: Okay. All right.
"Brennan: Incredible. Cody, that is gonna be your turn."
Murph: Sweet. This dude up here that is stunned-
Emily: Stunned.
"Murph: Is that one… That one does not appear to be flying on its own, appears to be hanging onto the balloon."
Brennan: Yes.
"Murph: Okay. Cody pulls out his ninja stars, (imitates stars whooshing) and then is going to… Can I try to throw and hit the string so that the stunned creature falls?"
"Brennan: Yes, you can. I'm gonna say your throw… First of all, what is the range on your stars?"
"Murph: So it would just be hand axe stats, so,"
"(Zac, face in his hand, laughs)"
Murph: Let me see.
Ally: String is the new rope.
"Murph: Oh, it's weirdly not in here, let me look up hand axe."
"Brennan: Oh, I have it, I have it right here in your… You just needed to equip it. So these are, they need to be within 60 feet. Are you right now within 60 feet? Yes you are. So you're gonna have disadvantage, and the string has an AC of 22. It's a tiny little string in the air. However, the string, this bundle of strings only has eight hit points. So you only need to hit, really, like once and do enough damage. Go ahead and make your attack rolls with disadvantage."
Murph: Okay.
(Emily laughs)
Lou holds out his hands.
"Cody: Star style, cutting cord."
(suspenseful music)
"Murph: No, no fucking way."
Lou lowers his hands.
(group laughing)
"Murph: Disadvantage, that's 20. 20’s not gonna do it."
"Lou: Wow, even with a 20?"
"Murph: Okay, I'll throw another star. No."
Emily: (laughs) You're honest though. I respect your honesty.
"Murph: Another 20, two 20s."
"Brennan: Cody, you fling-"
Lou: Wow.
Brennan: a fistful of these ninja stars.
Siobhan: So close.
"Brennan: They fly off into the sky and begin to fall, and you hear people below saying,"
Bystanders: Look out! Look out!
(group laughing)
"Kingston: Cody, stop!"
"Ricky: Yeah, Cody, you might wanna cut that out."
Cody: I'm fuckin' sorry. (laughs)
Brennan: (laughs) As raining shuriken begin to-
Cody: How sick would it have been though?
(Brennan laughs)
Ally: You hear me.
Cody: How sick would it have been if I—
"Ally: You don't see me. You just hear,"
"Pete: So sick, dude."
"Brennan: Amazing. Balloon beast is going to go for Kingston, misses terribly."
(Lou whistles)
"Brennan: Going back to the top of the order, Sofia, that's you."
"Emily: Okay, hmm."
"Zac: Oh, did you Command that balloon beast too?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Oh shit, yeah, misses it, that would have been nixed anyway. That just stays down. It doesn't do anything on its turn."
"Emily: Okay, because of that, I think that the balloon beast is not a threat, and therefore the only threats on the board are these two. Yeah, you know what, I think what I'm gonna do is I think that… Eh, that guy's gonna come out of being stunned. So I think I'm just gonna jump over and just go to town on this guy."
Lou: Let's go to town.
Ally: Go to town.
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Emily: I'm gonna, to borrow my friend, Cody, I'm gonna freak out on this guy, 'cause I'll have advantage on everything."
Murph: For once?
"Ally: Oh, just this once? Yeah."
"Emily: Just this once, I'm gonna freak out. That's gonna hit. That's a 22. I keep rolling ones on my fucking d8. That's six hit points. Can I use one of my attacks just to wrestle the balloon away from him and watch him plummet?"
"Brennan: Yeah, well, okay, you can substitute one of your attacks for a Shove action if you want. It'll be Athletics versus Athletics."
"Emily: Athletics versus Athletics, yeah, I mean, he's stunned. Does he have disadvantage on Strength checks or something?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I'll say that he has disadvantage for sure."
"Emily: Okay, yeah, let's go Athletics versus Athletics."
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: (drops a die) Whoop.
"Brennan: Plus two to this, lower of the two-"
Emily: Okay. I got a 25.
"Lou: Yeah, he ain't gonna cut it."
"Brennan: That beats an 11. Sofia, you rush up, kick this dude so hard in the chest that he releases his grip on the balloons. You snag the balloons. You now have a fly speed of 60, holding onto this bunch of balloons."
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Emily: Then can I… What I wanna do is I wanna get to Kingston, just to be there to steady the balloon eventually. Can I delay my bonus action? I basically wanna use the fly speed of this to get closer to Kingston, and then if I need to Step of the Wind the rest of the way to get to Kingston."
Brennan: Cool. I'm gonna say—
"Zac: There's only one dude left, right?"
"Siobhan: There's the guy next to you, right, this guy next to Ricky?"
Zac: Oh yeah.
Siobhan: And then there's this guy-
Zac: I see.
Siobhan: Way out the way.
Lou: And then there's also the archer.
"Brennan: Sofia, you've-"
"Emily: Oh, the guy next to Ricky, I hadn't even seen that. You know what, fuck it then. I'm just gonna fly back and Flurry of Blows on this guy."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it. Give me your attacks."
"Emily: Okay. First attack is, I think it's going to hit. First attack is 9 plus 12, 21."
Brennan: 21 hits.
"Emily: Okay. Finally I rolled a fucking eight, so 13."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: Oh wait, oh no. It's not my d8, fucking motherfucker."
(Ally laughs)
"Emily: It's actually my… I rolled a five, okay, so 10. And then I'll attack again with my… Oh, and I'll try and Stunning Strike."
"Brennan: Cool. Stunned, he is stunned."
"Emily: Oh, okay. Then I actually get advantage on my final attack. I just got a 24, so I hit him for another eight."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Bam, bam, bam! Just roundhouse kicks into the back of the head as you're holding onto this giant bunch of balloons. And then that is Sofia Lee. Moving on from Sofia Lee, Pete, that is you. You are invisible."
(Lou chuckles)
Ally: Awesome. Then I guess I'm just gonna attack this guy right in front of me.
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: I'll do another Fire Bolt. This one, oh wait, sorry, not Fire Bolt, Fireball."
"Brennan: Cool, go for it. I'm gonna roll that saving throw again. On a 15 or higher, this is bad for Pete. Here we go."
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan rolls a 12.
Brennan: No! Incredible.
Ally: Hell yeah.
Brennan: Go for it.
"Ally: All right, we're gonna do… Let's see. (vocalizes rhythmically) So that's 8d6. And they can try to save for half damage."
"Brennan: He has already, his saving throw is the thing he tries to use his reaction with. So go ahead and roll 8d6."
Ally: Gorgeous. 27.
Brennan: 27? You incinerate this clown.
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: (imitates air whooshing) Gone, baby. That is Pete's turn."
Ally: Uh.
"Brennan: Oh, sorry, anything else?"
Ally: Am I wild magic?
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and give me, now it's one, two, three."
Ally: Okay. (does an Ally and throws their die) Went off the table. (laughs) 10.
"Brennan: 10, now one, two, three, four. Incredible. That's going to be Ricky."
"Zac: Okay. So the only thing left is the flying guy over there, right?"
Brennan: Flying guy on the left and dog over on the right.
"Zac: And the dog has been Commanded. I will try, what's the distance from here? Okay, that flying thing's 80 feet, but I don't know how far it is without altitude."
"Emily: I do have that balloon, that's 60 feet of movement."
Zac: Oh.
Emily: I don't know. Maybe you could...
"Zac: I think I'm okay right now, but maybe-"
Emily: Okay.
"Zac: I was gonna do something else, but maybe later. Can I use Hypnotic Pattern on that guy? Any creature who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they become charmed for the duration."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Zac: They're incapacitated with a speed of zero, so just maybe, I don't know, maybe that's something."
"Brennan: Roll a save in front of the board. (it’s a 7) Fails, the clown fails. It is charmed by the Hypnotic Pattern. What does Ricky put in front of this?"
"Zac: Ricky sees all these clowns, and he tries to come up with something that a clown would be hypnotized by and creates a, like, one of those fun house mirror boxes around the clown so that it just sees itself over and over again."
"Brennan: Oh, awesome, who goes, (chuckles maniacally) and starts trying, just takes pies out of nowhere, and is trying to pie itself in the face."
"Ricky: Pretty bad, huh, this is what you are."
"Brennan: (laughs) You guys see Wally Claus. After Ricky casts that, Wally Claus leaps into action, flies, just lays a finger aside of his nose, flies up, and quickly attaches the cord of the Chompsky's outfielder to one of the cords of the caterpillar and begins to fly them both towards the… You're now reaching the top of this skyscraper to kind of tie those balloons off to the top of the skyscraper. Iga, that is your turn."
Siobhan: Great.
"Iga: Kingston, do you have, can you do damage? Is that a thing you can do? Can you hit people?"
"Kingston: Of course I can do damage, all right."
(Emily laughs)
"Kingston: I just, you know, people first."
Iga: You're like a nice guy.
Kingston: Damage second.
"Iga: I don't know, maybe you're like, I don't like hitting people."
"Kingston: Okay, Iga. I can handle myself, all right."
"Iga: Okay, okay."
"Siobhan: So I can reach this clown, and I feel like with damage, and I feel like maybe other people can't 'cause it's very far away."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Yeah.
Siobhan: So I'm gonna Eldritch Blast.
Emily: Ooh.
"Zac: He is hypnotized, and he'll come out when you hit him."
Brennan: So you'll actually have-
"Siobhan: Oh, really?"
"Brennan: You will actually have advantage on this first roll, because the clown's incapacitated."
"Siobhan: Mm. This guy has not been hit at all, right?"
Brennan: Correct.
Siobhan: (clicks tongue) And the dog has been hit a little bit?
Brennan: Yes.
Siobhan: I'm gonna cast Toll the Dead on the dog.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and roll damage."
Siobhan: Um...
Brennan: So it's 2d12.
"Siobhan: It's a Wisdom saving throw, and then it's 2d12."
Brennan: The dog succeeds on its saving throw.
Siobhan: Okay. So that's nine necrotic damage plus four bludgeoning damage.
Brennan: Whoa.
"Siobhan: 'Cause I have, my Elemental Gift gives me four for every."
"Brennan: Gotcha, I think if it succeeds, it actually—"
"Siobhan: Wait, no. It's not four bludgeoning damage, because it's only when I roll an attack roll. Never mind."
Brennan: Gotcha.
Siobhan: So it's just nothing.
"Brennan: I think Toll the Dead doesn't deal damage on a successful save. So I think this, the beast fully saves against it."
"Siobhan: You're right. Well, fuck me, what a waste of a turn."
Brennan: (laughs) Oh no. Any bonus actions or anything else?
Siobhan: No.
"Brennan: Cool. We scoot along. Ranged clown, with Hypnotic Pattern, Ricky, I don't think it makes any other saves, right?"
"Zac: I'll look at it again, I think it's just..."
"Brennan: It's just fucked. And the duration is one minute. That's going to be… Kingston, that's you."
Lou: Third-level Guiding Bolt directly into the dog.
(group laughing)
Brennan: Go ahead and make your attack roll.
Zac: Can I do damage?
"Kingston: Can I do damage, come on now."
"Iga: Hey, I don't know. You're just like a nice man."
Kingston: You were at the front of the train when I was doin' all my cool stuff for Cody and Pete.
"Iga: Oh, no, I believe you. I believe you."
"Kingston: Well, now you'll know."
"Lou: Okay, here we go. That's gonna be, god, please tell me this hits, 16?"
Brennan: 16 hits. That is correct.
"Lou: Oh, thank god. Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six. Okay, we'll take that. That's gonna be 29 points of damage directly into this dog, which is five feet away from me."
"Brennan: Incredible. You deal 29 points of damage, the dog is badly hurt, and the next person that attacks it will have advantage. (imitates explosion booming) (screeches) Screams, and immediately after you, you see it rears up like it's going to… It sees that they are losing the battle, and it wants to charge and take you off the balloon."
(Emily gasps)
Brennan: On its turn.
"Lou: Well, I have Bull's Endurance, so let's go."
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: Incredible. Cody, that is your turn."
"Cody: Okay, no more ninja stars, is that, have we agreed on that?"
"Pete: Yeah, no, no more."
"Cody: Okay, cool."
"Sofia: I mean, you'd probably have-"
Pete: It was really sick though.
"Sofia: A better chance hitting the dog with a ninja star. You were trying, you just… It was such a high AC 'cause you were trying to slice it."
Kingston: You were just throwin' them off into the sky.
Sofia: Hit a piece of string.
Cody: People were concerned about me throwing ninja stars off of a balloon in the sky over the city.
Ricky: I have to admit that was me. I felt that way strongly.
Cody: Yeah.
"Kingston: Yeah, you weren't alone."
Iga: I'm pretty concerned. My children are down there. I'm pretty concerned about it.
"Murph: Cool. I don't know if I totally have a way to do damage from far away without endangering everyone. So I am going to… I don't even think I can really get to Kingston here, can I?"
"Brennan: Difficult terrain, you might be waitin' for Santa Claus to just tie up these balloons."
Murph: Okay. Cody is gonna-
"Emily: Do I go before the dog? I do go before the dog, right?"
Murph: Sweet.
"Brennan: You do, mm-hmm."
Murph: I'll just hold my turn. Cody will take a readied action.
"Brennan: Cool, you hold your… You have a readied action. Kingston, this balloon beast is gonna go. It's going to give itself advantage by committing to going off the edge of the balloon. It's just charging. This balloon beast has a plus four to its Strength."
Emily: So you both are rolling with advantage.
Lou: Great. I have a plus one.
"Brennan: 2d20. Okay, you need to beat a 20. You need to beat a 20 with advantage."
"Lou: Well, here's the thing that you don't know, Brennan. That's that nothing bad is ever gonna happen to me, okay."
(Emily laughs)
Lou: Okay?
Zac: Ricky is just sweating bullets.
Brennan: That's a 10.
Lou: Did you guys-
Emily: Aww.
"Lou: Okay, yeah. Okay, here we go. Nothing bad is ever going to happen to me! (groans)"
Lou rolls a 12.
(group laughing)
Zac: Oh no!
Emily: Oh no!
Brennan: No!
"Lou: Ally, can you Bend Luck?"
Brennan: You guys see the last minutes of the fight.
"Zac: It's too much, never mind."
Ally: The max I could add to it is four.
"Lou: Yep, no, we can't."
"Murph: If I have a readied action, Sofie's balloons are here, right?"
Brennan: That's correct.
"Cody: Sofie, can I borrow these?"
"Sofia: Ask nicely, young man."
Murph: Can I grab the balloons and try to grab Kingston?
"Brennan: Yes, you are gonna roll with advantage, 'cause you're flying. You need to beat that balloon beast's Athletics check. So give me an Athletics check with advantage."
"Murph: I'm not, I don't-"
Emily: It's okay.
"Murph: I have good Strength, but I don't have Athletics. Oh my god, I'm sweating. Okay, I will roll it in front of the board. d20 plus my Strength is four."
Brennan: You need a 16 or higher.
Lou: Nothin' bad's ever gonna happen to us. Nothin' bad's ever gonna happen to us. Nothin' bad's ever gonna happen.
Zac: Can you do the Bend Luck?
"Brennan: Nine. No, you have advantage on this. You have advantage on this."
"Murph: Oh, sorry."
"Lou: Exactly, nothin' bad's ever gonna happen to us. Come on now. Come on now."
Siobhan: Come on now.
Lou: Just 'cause we roll…
Murph rolls another 9.
(group laughing)
"Lou: Okay, wasn't the 19 I was hopin' for."
Murph: Oh my god.
"Emily: Okay, okay, it's okay."
Lou: Wasn't the 19 I was hopin' for.
Emily: It's okay.
Brennan: You zoom down.
Emily: I can handle this.
"Brennan: You're within range of Kingston. That's your readied action. Kingston, the balloon beast hits you. You go off the edge of the balloon and begin to sail out into space, hundreds of feet up in the air. The next person to act, on Kingston's turn, he will fall. Sofia, it is your turn."
"Emily: Okay, I have Jump on me. I have Step of the Wind if I need it. I would like to tackle Kingston through a window of a building."
(group laughing)
Murph: Oh my god!
"Brennan: Go ahead, give me an Acrobatics check. It's still that DC is 20."
Emily: Okay.
Murph: Come on.
(Emily takes a deep breath)
Lou: Nothing bad's ever gonna happen to us. Come on now.
Emily: Okay. 10 plus 13.
Brennan: 23.
(Lou groans)
Emily: 23!
"Brennan: Kingston, this dog—"
"Emily: Oh, I saw the 10, and I was like, I didn't do it, I didn't do it."
"Brennan: Kingston, this dog hits you in the chest (barks) and begins to float. It had so much strength when it hit you and then just sort of starts floating off into space. The incapacitated clown archer just begins to sail off into the sky. You guys will have so many rounds while it's incapacitated to take that archer out. Santa Claus ties up the balloons. But as Kingston falls, you see swinging on the… No longer with the balloons in your hands, Sofia, swinging on the longest cord from the caterpillar, like Spider-Man, just (imitates body whooshing) bam, wrap your arm around Kingston, twirl him in the air, hit your back into the plate glass of the skyscraper, and tumble into an abandoned office. (imitates bodies thudding) I'm gonna say, Iga, you just blast, with Eldritch Blast, that archer out of the air. The dogs float away, and with shurikens and whatever else, pop. You guys are victorious. Santa saves the balloons. Sofia and Kingston stand up in this dark office with all the lights out and see you are in the headquarters of Excelsior Dynamic Homes. (bell tolls) And that's where we're gonna end our episode."
Ally: No way.
Siobhan: Oh no.
"Brennan: Tune in next week for another thrilling episode of ""The Unsleeping City."" Later."
Lou: Nothing bad is ever gonna happen to us!
(group laughing)
Murph: Oh my god.

(upbeat music)
"Brennan: Hello, one and all, and welcome back to another exciting episode of ""The Unsleeping City"". I'm your humble dungeon monster Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes."
"Brennan: Last we left off, the champions of New York City, they were high atop a number of Macy's Day Parade floats and balloons soaring high into the skyline of Manhattan. An incredible aerial battle ensued with some true clowns from the deep dreaming, but our heroes who had gathered there in the midst of preparations, sort of humming in the background were the collaboration between the Order of the Concrete Fist and the Gramercy Occult Society talking about an expedition into Nod to uncover what was behind the strange events unfolding here. However, just that morning, we had some insights into these strange events. Number one, Pete contacting Nod, the grey orphan, monarch of the sixth borough and seeing that they had left, Nod for a time to venture and find one of their siblings, named Nuria, and spoke of a third sibling as well. Pete awoke to go find his friends at the parade. After Sofia Lee had a tense showdown with Tony Simos, former first fist of the Monastery of the Midnight Sun. You all had finished your combat. These true clowns showed up. Kingston recognized them as the clowns of the Central Park Carousel, which, Kingston, you've not been to in some time. However, you saved Wally Claus, who has tied these floats, had tied these balloons, these parade balloons, to the top of the building but Sofia and Kingston in a daring rescue by Sofia Lee, saved Kingston Brown. They smashed through some plate glass to arrive in a darkened office, as a lot of the offices are, as the parade goes right by them. Darkened office for Excelsior Dynamic Homes, which is where we begin our story. On the top of the roof, Wally Claus beckons Iga, Pete, Cody and Ricky, going,"
"Wally: Hi everybody, come on down to the roof! It's so good to see you, guys. Ricky Matsui, how are you doing, buddy?"
"Ricky: Hey, Wally! Santa Claus, I mean."
"Wally: It's okay, it's both I think."
"Brennan: And you see, gives you a big hug. He goes,"
"Wally: Ah, you're the best, Ricky!"
"Brennan: And he smiles looks over to Pete and he goes,"
"Wally: Hey, Pete! It's Pete the Plug, how's it going?"
"Pete: Oh, it's great, yeah, hey Santa. I'm not quite the plug anymore, but yeah definitely."
"Wally: Oh, okay you make your money through something else, that's okay. Your name is still on the good list, so good job, Peter."
"Pete: [gasps] Cool, thanks."
Wally: [two thumbs up] Yeah!
"Zac: Well I think Ricky, I mean, after Wally is done saying hi to everybody would love to try to pull Wally aside for a second."
"Brennan: Cool, Wally looks over at, Iga looks at you real quick and he goes,"
Wally: You're Jess and Nick's mom!
"Iga: That's right, I'm Jess and Nick's mom. They're two good kids."
"Wally: They're two really good kids, it's great and thank you to you and your husband because you guys know magic is real. So I don't have to do an enchantment on your brain to make you think you bought the presents that I delivered."
"Iga: You give such good presents every year. You do, you do great work. I'm a fan."
(Emily laughs)
"Wally: Oh, that makes me so happy. And a hi, what, what's your name buddy?"
"Cody: I'm the Night Angel, Cody Walsh, ambassador of darkness and the Jersey Devil. I assume, I'm on the naughty list because I am evil incarnate."
Zac is laughing so hard he drops out of frame.
"Brennan: You see, he looks at you and says,"
"Wally: [unconvincingly] Sure, you're on the naughty list, that's right. So naughty, you got a tattoo? Wow."
"Ally, who is drinking a mug of coffee, just barely prevents a spit-take and has to hold their nose."
Brennan: You see— Ally’s losing it.
Cody: There's a devil in there.
Ally: So - full mouth full of coffee.
(cast laughs)
"Ally: ""You got a tattoo!"""
"Wally: Wow, that's so naughty!"
"Brennan: Ricky, you successfully pull, pull Wally Claus aside."
"Ricky: Thanks Wally Claus. Hey, I know we don't have a ton of time to discuss. It seems like Kingston and Sofia flew through a window or something, I don't know what happened but... just real quickly like, I'm kind of in an interesting spot where basically what I'm wondering is how do you tell if someone is good?"
"Wally: Oh boy, well there's kind of two schools of thought on this question. The first school of thought is you add up all the good things they done and you subtract all the bad things. That's one and the other. (murmurs) Yeah, the other one is that really good and evil are relative abstract concepts and so it's harder to determine what they are. It's not so much an analytical process as it is one of creative choices because we're waking up every day and trying to decide what is right and wrong based on what we are choosing to value. And if we value human flourishing and love, we will have a different moral code than if we value dominance and cruelty. So really when it comes down to it, it's a struggle each and every day to try and make the world the way you wish for it to be in which case good and evil vary from person to person. [pauses] But for the list we do the first one."
"Ricky: Gotcha, it's awesome. Cool, thanks Wally, just curious what your thoughts were on."
Wally: Okay!
Ally: Can I talk to Wally really quick?
Brennan: [laughing] Sure.
"Ally: Can I show him a picture of Priya's stupid fiance and be like,"
"Pete: Is this, is this fucking guy on the good list or the bad list?"
"Wally: Oh, he's extremely on the bad list for sure."
Pete: [shocked] Really?
Wally: Yeah. 100—
"Pete: Wait, what's this guy's name?"
"Wally: It says, he says yeah, his name is, his name's Calvin Thomas."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Wally: Yeah, Calvin, Calvin let me just tell you, without getting too much into it the, the amount of people they, he has been unfaithful with is truly staggering. Just, just wild, that's not nice."
"Pete: Wow, wow, yeah, yeah, yeah, he deserves a bunch of coal. He deserves a fuckin' bunch of coal to the mouth."
"Wally: Hey, are you all right?"
Pete: Pete just starts cracking his knuckles. Even though he's already cracked them. It's just like.
Pete: [pained] Ah! [cracks]
Zac: He realized how much...
Cody: Do you wanna go? Do you wanna go throw Big Gulps at this dude's house?
"Pete: Yes, I fucking do, Cody! That's a great idea, that sounds really cathartic."
"Cody: I'm in, we'll do that after we find out what happened to our friends who smashed through the window."
"Pete: Oh, right, right, okay, cool."
"Brennan: You guys get to head downstairs. Sofia and Kingston… You both stand within this sort of, and again, it's broad daylight outside. It's like, looks like mid-morning. So there's plenty of light in here but if that's still the eerie somberness of an office with none of the fluorescent lights on, so it's like shadows everywhere, very dim lighting... what do you as you bust in?"
Emily: First two things I do. I have two ki points left. I'm gonna cast Pass Without Trace on me and Kingston and then I'm gonna look for a security cam footage or security cameras just to make sure to get rid of any evidence we were here.
"Brennan: Hell, yes. I'm gonna say, give me a Perception check for the cameras."
"Emily: 14 plus 7, 21."
"Brennan: Kingston, you… as you are like getting up and brushing the glass off you, Sofia is already up. Shadows have whipped around her and you just watch a like hazy nimbus of shadow sprint across the room and yank a full camera out of the ceiling in a very practiced manner."
"Kingston: Oh, okay Sofie, all right, all right."
"Sofia: I'm just saying, if you wanna look around, we now have free access to do so without anyone peeping on us."
"Kingston: Well, I mean that's, I mean, hell yeah. I mean, this is the place that's been buying up all the property around my neighborhood, so."
"Sofia: Yeah, you brought it up."
"Kingston: Yeah, I'd love to have a look, can I—"
Emily: Can I watch the door while Kingston… I'll like give him the help action but I wanna like guard the door so that he can have as much time.
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
Zac: Picturing a 60 year old man using a computer.
(cast laughs)
Lou: Slow clicks.
Murph mimes “hunt and peck” typing with just his index fingers.
Ally: So close to the computer.
"Lou: Yeah, just all the way up in here. [getting very close to the camera] All right, let's see, okay. What, what check would you like?"
"Brennan: I will say if you're not using magic, go ahead and give me a, an Investigation check with advantage."
"Lou: I mean, I guess I don't, I don't think I have, I don't think I could use magic. So I guess I'll."
"Brennan: Are you, are you out of slots? Is that what's going on, right now?"
"Lou: No, I got plenty of slots. I've got slots all day! But I don't have, I don't have like Detect Magic or anything like that."
"Emily: What about that remote control thing, maybe you can..."
Brennan: You do have Remote Access.
"Lou: Oh, okay, great I'll put Remote Access to work. I mean, that's still, it's still Kingston on a computer. It's just, can I do, can I use remote access to be going, looking at a computer while I'm also going through files, like physically… are there physical files in here? What level of office, is this like a full modern office or? Okay, I'm just gonna make that Investigate check. That is going to be a 19."
"Brennan: Incredible, 19 investigation. I'm gonna say Kingston, first of all, you walk towards the computers and the computers all (zappy noise) turn on at your approach."
"Kingston: Is this normal? Sofie, do we - this is what computers do now?"
"Sofia: I have a tablet and I, I cannot get that thing to turn on."
"Kingston: Okay, well, we'll just assume this is normal then, all right."
"Brennan: After the computer turns on at your approach, Kingston, at that point, I'm gonna say, 19 Investigation. You find some paper stuff here, you have a feeling, none of the paper stuff will be important. You are not gonna know what the individual security things passwords, yada, yada, other stuff like that, is. But you do see a way on the computer you have right now to just copy this entire hard drive, the main hard drive of this computer and you could put it onto a flash drive or something… You think there's a utility desk that has like portable hard drives on it. You know enough to be like, I can just take everything here, download it to this thing and walk out the door."
"Kingston: [slowly] Command A, command C and click on the flash drive."
Siobhan: Just copy and pasting it.
Kingston: Command V.
"Sofia: Kingston, you are a pro."
Siobhan: Document copy and paste.
"Kingston: One of my, one of my little nieces showed me how to do this the other day, 'cause I was having, you know, cause I was switching, I got a new computer that I haven't opened yet."
"Sofia: Oh, okay. I gotta show you my tablet. Maybe you can figure out what's going with it."
"Kingston: Okay, yeah, that honestly, yeah, I could probably figure that out, all right. It's going to be two minutes, but."
Ally: There are so many young people in our party.
"Brennan: Incredible, if there are any, so you download a tremendous amount of info on a 19, you know, you have a lot of good stuff. You just don't know what the answers are in it. You can give me a further check if you want. If you have any specific questions, here, if you have any."
"Lou: Can I look for, in terms of like CEOs, CFOs, like names and then can I also search with regard to Gladiator? I think those are my two questions."
Ally: Ooooh.
Siobhan: Nice.
"Brennan: Hell, yes."
"Lou: I mean, one more thing. Can I look for JJs name or whatever his real name is, in anything?"
"Sofia: Oh, do me a favor and look for Tony also."
"Kingston: Oh, you got it, hold on, hold on, command F… ""T""...""O""...""N""..."
"Sofia: Honestly, watching you work is inspiring."
"Kingston: ""Y""...Space bar...""S""... I'm a ""Hunt 'n Pecker"", that's what my kids call me. They say I do a hunt and peck. I don't know what that means."
Sofia: Emphasis on the hunt because you are a hunter.
"Kingston: Here we go. Now we are in. You ever see that movie ""Hackers""?"
Sofia: Yeah.
Kingston: I feel like that right now.
"Sofia: Oh yeah, I minor illusion an Angelina Jolie wetsuit on myself."
Sofia: She wears them just as clothing. It's so cool. I feel really attractive—
Brennan: Go ahead call out… so those are four questions.
Lou: Yes.
"Brennan: Call out, so this first one is gonna be for like executives' names, give me an investigation."
Lou: Okay.
[bass music]
"Brennan: Still with advantage, right?"
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: These are actually all going to be straight rolls.
"Lou: Okay, you got it. [loses his die] Okay, it jumped out so it doesn't want to be rolled. Straight investigation, oh, all jumping out. They don't wanna be rolled."
Murph: Can you Bless yourself or anything?
"Emily: Ooh, Guidance?"
"Lou: Oh yeah, I'll Bless myself. So the first one will be a 14."
Brennan: Okay.
"Lou: The second one, which is for what?"
Brennan: This one is going to be for Gladiator stuff.
Lou: That is gonna be a 16.
"Brennan: Okay, this next one is for JJ."
Lou: That's gonna be a 13.
Zac: Who is JJ again?
Emily: JJ is the grad student.
Zac: All right.
Lou: And what's the last one?
Emily: Tony.
Lou: Tony?
Brennan: Tony.
Lou: Tony we're going 21.
"[Emily laughs, impressed]"
"Siobhan: Nice, fucking nice."
Emily: That fucker.
"Brennan: You pull up nothing on JJ. I will say with JJ, it looks like his application was denied. Like they did not accept him into the internship program, but they do have his like stuff on file. Executives-the corporate structure of this is bizarre. For, for Tony stuff, you do find Tony's stuff here."
"Kingston: [way too close to the camera] Sofie, Sofie get over here. I found Tony."
"Sofia: Oh, I'm kind of doing like a German shepherd at the door thing right now. Can you read it out loud to me?"
Ally: German shepherd in a wetsuit?
(Emily laughs)
Siobhan: It's such a sexy wetsuit...
"Ally: Listen, I pictured it sexy."
Zac: Do you ever see those pictures of a dog wearing like pantyhose that are horrible?
"Emily: Okay, okay I come over. I wanna see what's going on with Tony. [beat] In a wetsuit."
"Brennan: Tony stuff, Tony Simos filed a lawsuit that you see is not against Excelsior Dynamic Homes, it's all tied up in the Gladiator stuff. Tony was the owner of a property in San Francisco and you see that Gladiator was trying to buy him out and he refused and, and specifically like fought Gladiator, and there was a lot of like legal stuff. Gladiator was threatening legal action against him. They wanted the property that his property in San Francisco was on. And then at a certain point very recently..."
Emily: It gets dismissed?
"Brennan: At a certain point, very recently, it looks like a settlement was reached and Tony was awarded a sum of money."
"Emily: [knowingly] Hmm. Mm. Can I, do I recognize if the address is a personal residence or if it's the address of the monastery?"
Brennan: You think it's the address of the monastery.
Emily: Interesting.
Siobhan: Son of a bitch.
"Brennan: The other thing you find is there's a lot of Gladiator stuff here because Excelsior Dynamic Homes is owned by Gladiator Industries. You see Gladiator has been buying a bunch of shit here that you find sort of right away. You see that they have bought recently, obviously huge purchase of the Queens Center Mall. They have an enormous Cypher Energy Fluid plant that they are building down in the Pine Barrens in New Jersey."
"Emily: [laughs] No, don't make us go to New Jersey."
"Brennan: They, they also have recently been buying up, You see a ton of stuff, they've been buying ads, all along the A/C/E, like A trains are filled with Gladiator ads now, they also just bought two New York icons. They have managed - Excelsior Dynamic Homes has bought the Cloisters, which is an incredible museum way uptown in Inwood. They, it looks like the Cloisters has already been shut down and they made a deal with the city of New York and bought the Central Park carousel earlier this month and are converting it into Cypher Energy Fluid presents the Gladiator Industries Recreational Rotating Horse Area."
"Lou: It's the, are the files downloaded?"
Brennan: They are downloaded.
Lou: I cast Sacred Flame straight through the monitor.
(Brennan and Emily laugh)
Ally: Incredible.
Zac: On the cloud but-
"Sofia: I kind of wish I had a security camera for that, just to rewatch it."
"Brennan: You guys in the stairwell, Sofia and Kingston, you guys meet up with your companions coming down from the roof."
Kingston: It’s bad.
"Sofia: Yeah, we found everything."
Kingston: It’s real bad.
"Zac: Did Pete ever tell us about what happened, what Nod's conversation, with us?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I was just thinking that."
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: I think you got, Wally Claus is with, is with you guys and basically says,"
"Wally: Hey, I'd be happy to help, it sounds like you guys got some big problems. Do you want to come to dinner with my brother David and his family?"
Ricky: I'm so hungry.
Sofia: Yeah.
Iga: Will David be okay with seven other people showing up to...?
"Wally: Oh yeah, we're probably gonna go to Denny's."
Iga: For Thanksgiving you're going to Denny's?
"Brennan: You see, he says, says,"
Wally: What? Oh.
Iga: It's Thanksgiving.
"Wally: Yeah, now that you mentioned it, Denny's is probably closed."
"Pete: Yeah, that's the issue."
Cody: The sad thing is it might not be.
"Iga: Yeah, I know it might be opened."
Sofia: It's probably open.
"Ally: I have a feeling I would have told everyone right when I got to the thing, 'cause that's like a pretty big deal with all the Nod stuff."
"Emily: So let's just all fill each other in, and I'll fill everyone in that I fucked up with Tony but I say like, I think it could be good because it'll get his attention off of Pete and maybe he'll just go on a little crusade against me, which is less dangerous."
Iga: [crosstalk] So I think maybe the—
"Pete: [crosstalk] So do you think, oh sorry."
"Iga: The sibling, the sibling of Nod who was West."
"Ricky: So like Chicago, Austin. I'm just naming cities that are west of..."
"Iga: San Francisco, San Francisco, maybe San Francisco, San Francisco."
Ricky: Could be San Francisco!
"Sofia: Yeah, I'm thinking that Nod’s sibling was..."
"Iga: Something that worries me is the Cloisters. The Cloisters is where the unicorn of New York lives, I believe."
Pete: Ohhh.
"Sofia: Yeah, I think no matter what, we're gonna have to check out the Cloisters because if they already bought it, they had the carousel for a couple of days and already did some weird, magical shit with it. The Cloisters is already a potently magical place. They're absolutely up to some shit there."
"Iga: I always enjoy a trip to the Cloisters. They have that medicine garden, which is beautiful, a lot of stolen European art, which I feel ambivalent about but. [shrugs]"
Pete: I've been getting pretty into herbs.
"Cody: The Pine Barrens is also the ancestral home of the Jersey Devil, if we [takes a drag] wanted to go to Jersey."
Sofia: We want it.
Ricky: You shouldn't smoke in a staircase.
"Iga: I mean, I guess you can smoke in this stairwell."
"Sofia: Yeah, you can smoke in here."
"Kingston: Honestly, it's fine. Let him smoke."
"Cody: Yeah! Fuck these people, right?"
Kingston: Smoke all you damn want.
Cody: Thank you.
"Pete: Wow, brand new Kingston."
"Kingston: Honestly let me have one, give me one."
"Pete: Kingston, why are you in a wetsuit?"
"Sofia: Yeah, I’ll have one too."
Cody does hand some cigarettes over.
Ricky: [in consternation] Kingston! What— Kingston!
Brennan: Oh man!
"Iga: I mean, if we’re smoking I’ll have a cigarette."
Cody: I did find these on the street.
"Kingston: What do you do next? These calm you down, right?"
Zac: I’m using five Lay on Hands points to Cure Disease on Kingston every time he takes a puff.
[cast laughing]
Kingston coughs.
"Ally: Brennan, do you think, do I have an like an idea of, since the, I banished that like presence, will I have more access if I go to the Metropolitan Museum of Memories to these like Vox Phantasma that were gone because those memories were being taken away. But do you think they flooded back for a moment?"
"Brennan: I think Pete would definitely feel that he would have a stronger connection to the Metropolitan Museum of Memories, if you went there in Nod, 100%."
"Ally: Okay, oh, that's in Nod, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, Metropolitan Museum of Memories. But you could also go to, ‘cause the Metropolitan Museum of Memories is coterminous in that other dimension with the Met in New York City. So you could go to one and kind of be in the other. It depends on whether you're in the waking world or in Nod while you're going there, right, 'cause they're mirrors of each other."
Ally: I kind of want to run to that.
Ricky: Should we go eat with Wally first and just hash out a plan?
Sofia: Yeah.
"Kingston: Yeah, I think..."
"Sofia: Although Pete, if you, if you feel the call to Nod, I mean, I will also respect that."
"Pete: I don't really want to go to Nod but I would love to go to the Met and try to get these memories before whatever that presence that was like, deleting them comes back."
"Sofia: Yeah, that's great do you want me to escort you?"
"Pete: Yeah, I mean, that would be cool."
"Ricky: Do you think there's some sort of museum pass you can get like where all the museums, you get one price?"
"Pete: Oh man, I've been wanting them to do something like that forever and they just..."
Ricky: Cause if you go to Cloisters...
"Iga: They have that, you can do I think a New York pass. Cause the Cloisters… oh, but with Gladiator I don't know, but Cloisters & Metropolitan Museum, they're the same museum"
"Ricky: Oh, the Cloisters is just closed, never mind."
"Pete: Oh yeah, Priya actually taught at MoMA over the summer and so I still have her ID card. So we can get in half price to like a lot of the museum."
Iga: MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum are not...
"Pete: Yeah, no, I know they're not the same but they just it's so nepotistic, if you have an in at any museum, you can go anywhere for free, your access jumps through the roof. Meanwhile, the rest of us are paying $25 to see a herb garden. Livid. Don't get me started."
"Sofia: You were when you came to Staten Island, you guys did see the Staten Island herb garden, right?"
Pete: What's up?
[Brennan laughs]
"Kingston: Yeah, over at Snug Harbor?"
Ricky: You are talking about the weeds?
"Sofia: Well, yeah, it hasn't been weeded, but yeah, we have a really great herb garden there."
Iga: Like overgrown rosemary bush that was on the way?
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah."
Pete: It was that one rosemary bush.
"Sofia: Yeah, that's it."
"Brennan: You see that you guys begin to head off to Forest Hills in Queens, to go to the house of David Kugrich. It's getting later on sort of close to sunset for you guys here, traveling by train out to this, to Forest Hills. Yeah, Kingston is, what is Kingston feeling right now with his hard drive in his hands?"
"Lou: Pretty like, angry, which is not his normal. Like, he's like, mad and he doesn't, I don't know, it's just like, it's like just, isn't like being able to like clear his head and like think things through but is just like upset and I don't know, hoping that like they are, you know Pete can get answers or maybe, I don't know, maybe David can take a look at like... you know, and do like, law stuff but yeah, he's just like kind of like hurt in that way that doesn't lead to being productive or like working through it, just kind of feeling it."
"Brennan: Yeah, you all arrive at the Kugrich's home. You all haven't seen in a little while. Iga and Cody, this is your first time coming here."
"Emily: I stop Cody and I say,"
Sofia: Be the most respectful you have ever been.
"Cody: So I'll just be like a little less respectful than your average person, okay."
Murph: I walk on the grass instead of the sidewalk but I'm otherwise respectful.
(cast laughs)
"Brennan: Incredible, you all journey out here..."
"Ricky: Get off the grass, get off the grass."
"Cody: Ricky, you're trembling, you're trembling, dude."
Ricky: [eyes closed] Just get off the grass.
Cody: All right.
(cast laughs for a not-insignificant amount of time)
"Brennan: You arrive at David Kugrich's home, as you do so, you see his beautiful wife Diane opens the door and goes,"
Diane: Wally!
"Brennan: Runs up, gives Santa Claus a big hug. He goes,"
"Wally: Hey, how's it going? I know it's a holiday but I brought a bunch of the champions of New York City and these two new people that I don't know very well, but I do love them with all my heart."
"[gentle, warm music]"
"Brennan: You see that Diane looks up, introduces herself warmly. I think probably some of you have reached out every once in a while over the years, she smiles. Matt and Delia, their two children are much older now, you know like the youngest of them is now 12 and Matt is in high school. You guys walk into their lovely little home, see David's workstation stuff. All those years ago, Kugrash turned into an eagle and walked across the carpet in there to confront his son."
"Murph puts his hands up to his chin, grinning."
"Brennan: An image I will remember forever, a little walking eagle."
Murph mimes carefully stepping across a carpet like a bird.
"Brennan: [laughing] You see Diane says,"
"Diane: Welcome, come on in. We'd be happy for you to come and stay and have a bite. Wally, sent us a message ahead saying that there's some stuff you needed to talk about. Feel free to conduct your business. We know that when all you get together, something important is happening."
"Brennan: You guys see a giant coffin in the living room, sort of behind the sofa and you see that as the sun sets outside, Matt knocks on the coffin and goes,"
"Matt: Dad, sun's down!"
"Brennan: The coffin lid flies open and full Dracula, [crossing his arms over his chest] David like floats out like,"
David: [startled] Oh!
"Brennan: You see he's wearing boxers and an undershirt and goes like,"
"David: [raspy] Ugh, all right. [normal] Oh gee, I'm sorry I didn’t know we had company. Yeah, hello, hello. Kingston, Sofie, Rick, Pete, good to see you. Hello, I'm David. Hon?"
"Brennan: You see some pants are thrown in from the other room, and he puts some pants on."
"David: How's it going, everyone, everyone doing all right?"
"[brief moment of silence, Iga sighs]"
Ricky: Doing great.
"Sofia: Yeah, I mean, we've got, there's some stuff going on in the city that we could probably use some perspective on."
"Brennan: Heck, yeah, you see that Wally comes through in the other room and goes,"
Wally: My brother David! Santa Claus' brother is a vampire!
Brennan: [miming hug] And you see he gives him a big—
Emily: It's just a beautiful family portrait.
"Brennan: Give’s a big hug and David says,"
"David: Hey, Wally, good to see you, bud oh, you look great. This jolly old elf, come here big guy."
"Brennan: And he goes,"
"David: Oh man, our dad's a magic rat who's everywhere!"
"Emily: Oh, I was just thinking, I wish I could fill out this picture with a tiny rat."
"Ally: If there is a family portrait anywhere, can I have a wallet size of it?"
(laughs)
"Emily: Rat, Santa Claus, and a vampire."
"Brennan: Just a rat being like, “my two boys, vampire and Santa Claus.”"
"Ally: And little rat, little eagle."
"Brennan: Oh, a little eagle being like, I look like an eagle, but really I'm a rat."
Zac: Like a Father’s Day picture.
"Brennan: You, you see that, yeah, David says like,"
"David: Yeah, take us, let's take a seat at the kitchen table."
"Brennan: He says,"
David: I know you guys got business.
"Brennan: Wally says,"
"Wally: Yeah, I could only be here for one night because we're, it's, it's game time back at the North Pole, but if you want our help, we'd be happy to give it to you."
"Brennan: David takes a solid plastic medical bag of blood out of the freezer, throws it in the microwave, hits reheat."
"Kingston: You like it hot, David?"
"David: Oh, you got..."
Kingston: Is it better hot?
"David: Yeah, it's like, it's already a battle of wills to be like, well, it's actually not that hard to be a vampire that doesn't eat people but this is already like, sort of, you know, like it being warm makes it easier to like stay on the straight and narrow, you know what I mean?"
Ricky: It's like a regular body temperature.
"David: Regular body temp, exactly."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Cody: You gotta, you still gotta cook your impossible burger. I get it, I worked at Hot Topic, so I'm vampire-adjacent."
"Brennan: [laughs] You see David goes,"
"David: Right, what is that, what, what is Hot Topic?"
There’s a beat. Cody looks confused and shakes his head a little.
"Cody: You're sure, you're 100% sure, you're a vampire???"
"David: All right, hey, take a seat, okay."
"Brennan: So you see a moment later, David's got like a little fleece on, like he's the most like, he's wearing like slacks and like house shoes and like a fleece and then is like a vampire. It looks like the most like dad-looking vampire and Wally's seated there. PS - you guys have filled each other in on everything. Now, as everyone knows the interaction Pete had with Nod. You know what Sofia knows, but I guess you guys fill David in on that."
Siobhan: I have a question about David.
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
Siobhan: So he's a DA? Do I—
Brennan: He’s actually—
Siobhan: Or is he not a DA anymore?
"Brennan: He's working with Liz who is DA, he was actually a civil litigator."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: David, David actually can tell you, you see David answers Iga's question about what he's doing and he's like,"
"David: I'm working on the pixie mob stuff with Kingston's partner, Liz, who's a whiz, man, and it's, and by the way, congrats to you and her, cause I, you know, she..."
"Kingston: She's something, you know."
"David: That woman is brilliant and, good for you, my friend."
"Siobhan: So have I in my, my shadier dealings in underground New York come across David or Liz?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I think so probably yes, yes."
[Siobhan makes a nervous noise]
"Brennan: David looks at you a little knowingly and is like,"
"David: All right, anyway before—"
Iga: It is nice to meet you for the first time.
"David: Yeah, what's, what's your name again?"
"Iga: It's Iga, I don't go by any other name. Let's say, it's just Iga."
"David: Okay, Iga. Nice to meet you. Yeah, so mostly I've been doing a lot of vampire hunting, which, you know there's a lot of vampires in the city that it kind of, these old school assholes where it's like manipulate, you know, have an evil domain and, you know, ""children of the night, oh, what sweet music they make."" So basically what I do is I hunt those vampires through civil courts. Most of them have committed some crazy amount of tax fraud 'cause they're all like hundreds of years old. So we just get the city or whatever to repossess their homes and then we bulldoze it during broad daylight and it's a much easier way to hunt vampires."
(cast laughs)
"Sofia: Oh, wow."
"David: Yeah, so that's mostly what I do. I'm kind of like a Van Helsing with like a legal brief but."
"Sofia: That's really, that's really cool."
Emily: I look at Cody to see if he's impressed by that.
"Murph: Cody is impre— so confused. He knows he should be pumped, so he's just nodding."
Brennan: You see that.
"Murph: He heard ""Van Helsing"" and just started nodding."
"Siobhan: [Cody voice] Love that movie, man."
"Brennan: David looks over, you guys also have stuff to discuss about Tony and Nod and you also Kingston have this, this drive of—"
Lou: I think I'm just waiting for like the right time to like pull it out.
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: I think it's now.
"Kingston: Hey Dave, you got a computer?"
"David: Yeah, my man, I got one in the, in the, in the, the office. What do you need?"
"Lou: I hold it up and I'm like,"
"Kingston: I don't know what you do with, I think you jam this in somewhere."
"David: [holding out a hand to stop him] Let me, you want me to walk through this with you real quick?"
Kingston: Yeah.
"Brennan: He walks through it with you, takes it. He says,"
"David: All right, I'm gonna go be with Kingston for a second,  "
"Brennan: Walk in, Kingston and David are going into the office. The rest of you are out here with Wally Claus and you see Wally goes,"
Wally: So I'm pretty busy until Christmas comes around but is there anything you guys are scared of or you're working on?
Ricky: Is there anything that we're scared of?
"Wally: Yeah, you need help with?"
"Cody: If you could destroy Gladiator and reinstate the Queensville Mall, that'd be cool."
"Ricky: Hey Wally, can you see if Tony's on the naughty list?"
"Wally: Oh, Tony Simos?"
"Ricky: Yeah, that's his name, right?"
Sofia: Yeah.
"Wally: Oh, Tony Simos is on the bad list."
"Sofia: Okay, can, can I ask you a question, Wally?"
Wally: Yeah.
Sofia: What's the most powerful or impressive thing you've ever gotten someone for Christmas? What's the biggest thing someone's ever asked for and you were able to deliver on?
"Wally: For me, not that much because I only been Santa Claus for three years."
"Sofia: Right, I was assuming that you would have the knowledge of all previous Santa Clauses, but-"
Wally: I have some of it. I think the biggest thing that ever came as a Christmas gift to somebody was the birth of Christ to the Virgin Mary.
(Emily laughs)
"Sofia: Okay, I guess I walked into that, yeah."
Ricky: Wow. That is pretty—
"Wally: But I'm not responsible for that, that wasn't me."
Pete: That's a pretty big gift.
Iga: Santa made that happen?
(cast laughs)
Wally just shakes his head.
"Emily: So canonically, in our world—"
Iga: What is the mathematics on this time-traveling Santa?
Ally: I'm just picturing the manger scene but Santa's in there too.
"Zac: I lean over to Cody and say,"
Ricky: Jesus Christ is real by the way.
(cast laughs)
"Pete: Hey Wally, I mean."
Cody: And so is the Anti-Christ.
"Pete: You know, no one, I'm sure no one cares, especially not me, but it's Priya on the good list or the bad list, Priya?"
Ally: And I show a picture of Priya.
"Brennan: Oh, you see."
"Emily: I'm kind of curious, I'll be honest."
"Brennan: You see, he looks and says, says,"
"Wally: Hey Pete, do you think this line of questioning is good for you, like on an emotional level?"
"Pete: [quietly] Dammit. You got so wise when you became Santa. You're like a, you're right. I let go of my need to know, you know, it's unhealthy. It feels like a need, but it's not."
"Cody: Well, Wally Claus, I have a question. So like if you're… [defensively] I'm not gonna ask a fuckin’ dumb question, I'm not gonna ask a fuckin’ dumb question, all right? Look."
Ricky shakes his head disapprovingly.
"Cody: If you can like see all kinds of different stuff and everything do you know like what happened with this like Tony guy and the San Francisco place, did he just like give it away or something?"
"Wally: Oh, I don't know, every piece of whatever happened. I know it in a way to make the list out of it but I, you know, people still have free will. I saw I'm not omniscient like that but I do-- I just see people when they're sleeping and know when they're awake and I know if they'd been bad or good. So again, I can visually see them when they're sleeping."
Iga: But you can't see them when they're awake. You just know whether they are awake?
"Wally: No, I KNOW when they are awake."
Iga: Cause you can't see them.
Sofia: Has New York been sleeping more?
"Wally: You know what's interesting is... people have been sleeping like maybe a little bit more but they're not doing the, um… [taps his temple] the dream time part of sleep where your eyes are Googling."
Pete: REM?
Iga: Weird.
"Wally: REM! That’s right, yeah, they're not doing so much REM."
Sofia: Interesting.
"Ricky: You think they're not exercising, what do you think?"
Wally: I don't know.
Pete: Energy drinks.
"Sofia: Energy drinks, that's what I was thinking."
Iga: Could be the energy drinks are not healthy.
"Cody: Do you guys think that, yeah, I’m sorry, just this whole Gladiator thing just seems sort of like a conspiracy against me, the chosen one 'cause it's like they go after the mall…"
Iga: Chosen by who?
Sofia: [crosstalk] I was agreeing with you and then you said “me”.
"Cody: And then they go to the Pine Barrens, when I'm the Jersey Devil. Grr, energy drinks, coincidence?"
Iga: What?
"Pete: [without confidence] Yeah, maybe."
Cody: Coincidence?
"Iga: You just say ""energy drinks, coincidence?"" No, that is not a sentence. What?"
"Murph: I keep instinctively going for a cigarette but like try and be respectful so I'm just smoking the air, like in my hand."
"Cody: It's just my hand, just doing this."
"Sofia: This is a very important family, you will treat them with respect."
"Brennan: We cut into the office, where David is sitting with Kingston Brown looking at this Gladiator stuff. You see David opens it up and begins to like crack into a lot of the files here, looking at them he goes,"
"David: Jesus Christ. This is a fucking web, where did you get this stuff?"
"Kingston: [stammers] You're a lawyer, so should I say yes? Should I tell you?"
"David: [waving his hand to cut Kingston off] The less I know, the better, that's all right."
"Brennan: He looks up and goes,"
David: Excelsior Dynamic Homes. This is a shell company.
"Brennan: You see he opens up a kind of like professional sort of legal search browser on his computer and begins to start like requisitioning public documents like, like LLC business filings and you see that as just going to his computer, he's like,"
"David: Okay, well, Excelsior is, is owned by Gladiator but it looks like there is this something. It says something's going on with the taxes here. Is there something that's like a nonprofit, this is a weird relationship,"
"Brennan: He's opened up a spreadsheet. He's like,"
"David: That's a weird relationship with, that's a for-profit company partnered with a nonprofit."
[rising tense music]
"Brennan: Opens something else up. He's like,"
David: Oh my God.
"Brennan: He's like,"
David: Excelsior is not even the only real estate company they own. These people are trying to buy up everything.
"Brennan: He finds other stuff, he says,"
"David: Who, who actually owns…"
"Brennan: He goes in, opens a PDF, and you see that it's it looks like official corporate filings for Gladiator and the computer opens for him to get information related to Gladiator itself and the PDF opens, opens another one and [error noises] PDFs open kind of like shrinking into infinity, the computer snaps, fries, and goes out. [zap noise]"
Kingston: Is that a normal thing? Does that often happen to computers?
"David: Shit, what the fuck, did the surge go out?"
"Brennan: You see that, he looks at like the, where his computer's plugged into the wall but Kingston, go ahead and give me an Insight check."
Lou: That'd be a 31.
"Brennan: You saw as the PDFs were opening, opening, opening, opening, you saw a hole open into the other side, into Nod and you saw bright indigo and lavender but you saw Nod from way outside. Like, like almost like from orbit and just saw like the little dream version of New York, which just floats there because it's not surrounded by like Long Island or Westchester or New Jersey. It's just Nod floating there. You saw it from way away and you see a wash of colorlessness that renders everything behind it into gray scale and in that shape coalescing, the last thing you saw was in the hole before the computer just gave out what looked like a hand vaster than the city itself reaching towards the hole straight towards you."
Siobhan: Mm-mm.
"Lou: I stride into the other room and I'm just like,"
"Kingston: Cody is right, Gladiator DIES! (roaring echoes)"
Cody: Yeah! Yeah! [sword tricks]
(cast laughs)
Brennan: As Kingston says that...
"Ricky: Hey, put the sword down, put the sword down inside."
Cody does not.
"Brennan: As Kingston says that, you guys, to put it...Kingston's voice echoes out and there is a moment where you guys recognize that the title of Vox is not a figurative one. Kingston's voice roars as though there were a hundred lions behind him repeating the same exact sentiment and sentence and you guys feel a reverberation, boom! head out into the city with Kingston as its locus."
"Zac: Can we, if you like hearing what happened in there like, do you think that they're safe here in this house? Like, do they know where that, that happened from?"
"Lou: Do I have a sense of that? If it felt, if it felt like a local, like, I don't know."
"Brennan: I think on a 31, you..."
"Lou: Yeah, on a 31, what's the vibe?"
"Brennan: I think a 31, on the vibe is, 31 Insight. That thing wasn't seeing this place, it was seeing you, you think that you're the target, not David or this house."
"Kingston: Great, yeah, I think it's, I think it wants me and even more than that it wants this city and whatever it is, Gladiator is its instrument and they got to go in a big way."
Cody: [whispered] Fuck yeah.
[Brennan cracks up]
Pete: Do we still have that that drive or did it get fried?
"Kingston: Dave, is it, can we still use that?"
"Brennan: David: Yeah he says, he says, I don't think anything's fried my monitor can't come back on but it's just, it's just a monitor, I can go get another screen. The coDave takes the drive, the drive seems okay. He says, he says,"
mputer is fine.
Ricky: We'll pay for the monitor.
"Kingston: Don't worry about that. We'll get you a monitor, I got a guy."
Sofia: Yeah.
David: All right.
Kingston: Okay.
"Brennan: You see David looks at you and sees what Kingston said the whole fucking city heard what Kingston said even if they don't know it but David looks and says,"
"David: Hey, Kingston, I'm on this, I'm gonna talk to Liz and I'm gonna let you know right now that I'm on this All right, I'll be in touch. You're gonna hear from me once a day."
"Kingston: Hey, I appreciate that but hey, we already took Thanksgiving away from you, all right, please don't give any more than you're comfortable with, all right? But it means a lot."
"Brennan: He smiles, and you see that he actually, he smiles and even like, distends his fangs a little bit and he's like,"
"David: When it's time to hunt, it's time to hunt. You know what I mean, let's get to work."
"Brennan: He says,"
David: I always said lawyers were bloodsuckers. Oh!
(laughs)
Iga: It's nice to have a sense of humor about that.
"David: Well, like, I, what are you gonna do? ...it is what it is."
"Brennan: As he says, it is what it is, Sofia, you get a little text on your phone saying,"
"Cindy: Take Thanksgiving off, but we need to see you at the monastery tomorrow morning."
Brennan: It's from Cindy.
"Sofia: Absolutely Cindy, please enjoy the, enjoy the afternoon, I'm thinking of you."
"Ricky: Is Cindy, on the...naughty or nice?"
"Sofia: Cindy's got to be, I think, I think Cindy's good. Cindy's the reason that I've been trying to handle Tony with a certain amount of aplomb; it's out of respect for Cindy. However, is she being manipulated by Tony? That I don't know."
"Ricky: Pete, were you talking about the hard drive earlier?"
"Pete: Yeah, like just trying to save it, so that maybe we can see some more of this info. It sounded really interesting."
Ricky: Do you think your… your old friend?
"Siobhan: Oh, 5E\/3N?"
Pete: I was thinking about asking 53\/3N.
Kingston: Yeah.
Pete: Was thinking about asking 53\/3N...
"Brennan: Rad, so you guys all head out, I will say some of y'all have plans maybe some of y'all don't, I'll just go around real quick. Cody, do you head back to Jersey with your family for today or no, not at all?"
"Murph: Not at all. I think Cody goes to the gas station, gets some hotdogs—"
"Siobhan: Oh no, Cody."
Ally: [high-pitched] Multiple!
Murph: —and like a Monster energy drink—
Zac: No!
Ally: Multiple hot dogs!
Murph: —and goes back to Queens.
Lou: I definitely...
"Emily: I think that I, Sofie doesn't have anything going on, so that's too sad."
"Lou: Kingston invites anyone without something to do to his house for Thanksgiving, his mother's cooking too much food as it is."
"Brennan: It's a huge, the entire Brown family is gonna be there. It's gonna be like Christmas. It's gonna be the, it's gonna be Claude's apartment downstairs, stretched out, tons of tables."
"Lou: I'm not trying to take Monster energy drinks away. Just before we park, Kingston says that anyone who wants to, he's headed back home and they're more than welcome."
Sofia: Can I invite my mother?
Murph: Cody will go to Kingston's.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Sofia: Can I invite my mother?
Brennan: Yes—
Kingston: Sofie…
"Brennan: Oh, sorry."
"Kingston: [pointedly] Sofie, do you think you could, do you think you can invite your mother? Do you think you can invite your mother?"
": I can, I can, okay, I'm texting her."
"Kingston: Of course you can, good, good."
Brennan: Awesome.
"Emily: And I send, I send an Unseen Servant to escort her 'cause she's not good at taking the ferry."
"Brennan: Cool, you send an Unseen Servant to escort her there."
"Murph: Would I know if my roommate Josh, is, would he have family nearby or is he probably just at the house?"
"Brennan: He, he doesn't have, his family is way out west and he's too broke to get home this year. He was, he's saving his money to go for Christmas."
"Murph: Cool, so then I guess I'll ask Kingston if I can bring,"
"Cody: Um, so like, my boy Josh, he's like, we were gonna eat hot dogs tonight, but like, if I'm going there, then like Josh, isn't gonna have any hot dogs is like the problem."
Kingston takes this news with a truly baffled expression.
"Cody: So I don't know, it's dumb, but… [rubs his head]"
Kingston: Do you wanna bring Josh?
"Cody: Can Josh come, is that cool?"
Kingston: You think Josh can come? Do you think Josh can come? Josh can come.
"Cody: I do, thank you, thank you."
"Kingston: Josh can come, yeah, yeah, yeah. It just, none of y'all is allowed to smoke in my mama's house, all right? There’s a roof—"
"Cody: All right. Josh doesn’t, Josh—"
"Kingston: Oh Josh, doesn't smoke? Okay, good."
"Cody: Josh, doesn't smoke, no. Thank you."
Emily: Can I real quick try to pickpocket any cigarette butts out of Cody's pockets just to make sure it's fully empty.
Brennan: Give me a Sleight of Hand for sure.
Emily: Okay.
Ally: What a gross thing to pickpocket.
Emily: I got a nat 20! [laughing]
"Brennan: Incredible, it's gone, they're gone. Sofia and Maria are headed there, Cody and Josh are headed there. Pete, you not only, I assume have been invited by Kingston."
"Lou: You think he's been invited, Brennan? You think he's been invited?"
(laughs)
"Brennan: You also specifically get a number of texts, oh sorry, not texts. You get a number of enormous font emails from Victoria, specifically asking, from Kingston's mom, specifically asking what your favorite dish is, what you used to get made when you were a kid, where she can find a recipe for it and you get one extremely menacing text message from Winston of a table full of dominoes and just his face in the selfie pointing at the dominoes going,"
"Winston: Ready when you are, champ."
"Ally: Incredible, incredible. I'm of course gonna go to Kingston's house but I think I might actually try to hit a meeting on the way."
"Brennan: Cool, I can dig that. Hell, yeah and if any of these are our triggers, by the way, feel free to go ahead and roll cause Thanksgiving is, it like can be an intense family time."
Ally: We're good.
"Brennan: Ricky, what would you and Esther be doing tonight?"
"Zac: I feel like I wonder if they would not go to a, I think this is two things: one is probably Ricky not wanting to be around Cody."
[cast laughs]
"Zac: And going like really hard in a different direction but like trying to do, it's kind of seems like there's a lot of people there maybe, maybe it's maybe not super safe to have even more people in a small apartment situation. So maybe we should do our own thing, also like maybe, you know, JJ wants to do something else, maybe he's not super into Thanksgiving, I don't know, maybe we could do like something at the Gramercy Occult Society."
"Brennan: Yeah, you see that Esther says that would be really, really nice. JJ obviously is Native American. Not really into Thanksgiving. He doesn't really celebrate it. You see… Ricky, we'll run a scene between you and JJ. That's actually very sweet for Ricky to reach out to JJ. And Iga, you and your family, what are you guys up to?"
"Siobhan: I think I've been this whole time, like cooking a big feast in the big ovens inside the castle 'cause like she uses the regular kitchen in the house for like regular meals, but when you want to do like a bunch of stuff at once, and then you can leave the house with it, 'cause it's not gonna burn down, you know."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: So she has like, she in Greenpoint has like her like extended group of people that traditionally come over to their place for Thanksgiving."
"Brennan: Marta is coming over, Yagdash is coming over."
"Iga: Fantastic, Yagdash, you dumb little boy."
"Brennan: Lugash comes from the meeting that he goes to with Pete real quick. You see Lugash, he says to you, Pete as you're heading out, like,"
"Lugash: Please give my love to Kingston Brown. Tell him that, you know, I'm still pulling bullets out of gangsters... Pulled him out of Yagdash, your old roommate the other day but you know, please give him,"
"Pete: Oh, that fuckin’ guy."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Lugash: He's a beautiful man and I hope that he and Liz, they're very happy."
"Pete: Aww, I'll let him know, I'll definitely let him know."
"Brennan: Awesome, we'll we'll run these. So yeah Ricky, you..."
"Ricky: I also had a thing, another thing I would just realize that I should do but like probably, maybe we would actually do it at Helping Hands and I could do I actually I have Create Food & Water and use that to make like a giant spread."
[gentle piano music]
"Brennan: Rick, you head off for the evening create a huge spread at Helping Hands. Go ahead and give me a persuasion check with advantage."
"Zac makes his roll, then looks up with a sheepish expression, twisting his mouth to the side."
Zac: 12?
Ally: That face.
"Brennan: Yeah, you know, the, the food, well, you make, create a huge feast. Helping Hands is very grateful. You see Rust there and some of the other regulars, they smile and wave and you see Esther basically says like,"
"Esther: Hey, I'm gonna swing by my mom & grandma, we missed a lot of Thanksgivings together but if you wanna swing by the Gramercy Occult Society, I would happily I'll come meet you in a little bit."
"Zac: Cool, yeah I text a selfie with the food and Ox on my shoulder."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, cool. You're at the Gramercy Occult Society. Orlando and Rovias look down and smile as,"
"Lions: Well, Mr. Matsui, the, the partner of the chairwoman of the society! As always, right this way."
"Ricky: Thank you, good to see you."
Zac: I give them both turkey legs.
"Lions: We have, neither stomachs nor digestive tracts but we will chew on these and spit the bones out into Bryant Park. [weird chomping]"
"Ricky: Exactly what I thought, yeah."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you, you head inside and you see JJ down there who you see, is… Would you, would you like go to his room to check up on him or would you like, what do you think Ricky would do?"
"Zac: I think I would, yeah, yeah, I'll knock on his door."
"Brennan: You knock on his door, he opens it up, takes his headphones off - did you text him ahead of time that you were coming or no?"
"Zac: Yeah, I probably would have let him know I was coming by."
"Brennan: You see, he comes out and he's like"
"JJ: Rick, what's up, man? Good to see you."
Ricky: Hey dude.
"[gentle, cosmic-sounding music]"
"Brennan: He's like,"
"JJ: Dude, I, I took the liberty of grabbing some, we got, we got wontons, we got wonton soup. We got egg rolls, I got some sesame chicken and I got a bunch of great stuff. So we like got a full spread. The, are you like a PS4 dude, XBOX, or...?"
"Ricky: Yeah, all kinds, I do I play the, uh…."
"Brennan: Ricky doesn't play video games, but yeah."
"Ricky: You know, I think I, I play like whatever games are, are maybe sports related or maybe, you know what, I'm gonna be honest I don't really know much about them but I'll give it a shot."
"JJ: We'll start on something super easy, dude that sounds great."
Ricky: Okay.
"Brennan: Give me an Insight check if you'd be so kind. And do so with advantage, I think."
"Zac rolls, then makes the same face as last time in silence. Ally and Emily laugh at him."
Zac: So 10.
"Brennan: 10, cool, yeah, you see, JJ has got a new spot here. He's been here for about like a month. It looks sparse, you know you see there's a lot of nerd shit in here, posters there's cool video game systems, tons of laptops and electronic stuff that he's experimenting with. You also see like a beautiful family portrait of his family back in Florida, dressed in Seminole regalia. You see there's an awes- He has like a cool little bedside table and there's a little like hunting knife that has like a gator skin. Sheath around it, looks beautiful and handmade. There are some like small wrappings of like beads around the sort of belt that goes with it and you see that he looks up and is like,"
"JJ: Dude, thanks so much for, for hollering. It's nice to have someone to like chill with on a day where like everyone is super busy."
"Ricky: Totally, yeah I mean, my family is not like super into the holiday or whatever, so I'm just like, you know, doing some other stuff, pretty sick knife over there. Just couldn't help but notice."
"JJ: Hell, yeah, my dad actually made that for me when I was heading out to New York."
Ricky: Whoa.
"JJ: Yeah, man."
"Ricky: That's awesome, do you get to go back home very much ever or do you...?"
"JJ: No super, not super a lot. Like I got a pretty big scholarship, which was rad I, cause I, I nailed all my tests when I was in high school and I had a perfect GPA and..."
Ricky: Wow.
"JJ: But like I don't, in other words, like, like it's very cool that I'm even here to be here at all but like all the cash that I have kind of goes into just like surviving in a very expensive city. So, I FaceTimed with the folks and with my bros who are still back in Florida. Yeah, man I don't know. It… city's really lonely, man. [laughs a little, shakily]"
Ricky: Yeah.
"Brennan: I think, Ricky's Divine Sense tingles a little bit here as, as JJ says that."
Zac: Can I make some kind of check with that or is that?
"Brennan: Yeah, I think go ahead and give me Perception."
"Zac: That's much better, 19."
"Brennan: You see JJ, who is this, like, incredibly brilliant, very sweet guy is really struggling. He's like very lonely. And you know that his whole family is way far away and that you, you sort of smell this like feeling of... clearly he moved into the Gramercy Occult Society. So it's not like he, whatever living situation he had as a grad student at Columbia was like, he was clearly happy to like, not do it anymore. So you can't imagine, you never, you never heard him talk about a partner. You haven't really, really like, you saw how quickly he became attached to Cody. It seems like this is not a dude that necessarily felt like he had a lot of friends here and I think Ricky looks at him and you see... Umbra. You see that this emptiness isn't just existing in these spaces of like the large-scale, vulgar things, of like the empty storefronts, the empty apartments, the empty things. But it, it mirrors and is a fractal of itself in individuals as well and you see that, I don't know. I think that, that you see for a moment like JJ took this incredible opportunity to seize this thing and is struggling with feeling totally isolated in New York. And I think Ricky probably feels like the power of loneliness in New York City. Maybe something that Ricky has never had to struggle with, but JJ has no family here and if you had not come here, he would have spent this, this night, like gaming with whoever was on XBOX Live on Thanksgiving night—"
"[Ally sighs explosively, laughing sadly offscreen]"
"Brennan: —in a city where he works all day and is overworked and isn't surrounded, like that little knife on his bedside table and this picture of his family, you kind of go like you have that like Divine Sense. You're like, oh, that's, that's the thread he's holding on by, to not feel like nobody in the world here knows him or cares about him and even Esther, Ana, & Amelia who are great and very kind to him, are still busy working themselves and have their own attachments. I think Ricky feels the power of loneliness and sees that JJ has been having a hard, hard time."
Zac: Ricky really quickly like tries to get a video game going 'cause he's crying.
(cast laughs)
"Brennan: You see, JJ looks at you and says,"
"JJ: Dude, are you okay? What's up, man?"
Ricky: I just haven't played a game in a long time. And I'm just ready to— it's good to hang out.
Ally: [laughs] What a psycho.
"Brennan: He goes, he goes,"
"JJ: Dude, dude, you're full on weeping. It's, what's up?"
"Ricky: Oh yeah, sometimes like my magic, I'm, well, like I, you know, I'm a former firefighter here and I have the ability to create water and that's… happening."
Zac: I give him a hug.
"Brennan: Oh, go ahead, go ahead and roll Persuasion with advantage if you'd be so kind."
"Zac: That's, was an 18 but cocked, okay. Oh, that's only, that's an 18."
"[gentle, warm music]"
"Brennan: You give him a hug and warm light starts to just flow out from you and this is like, you realize more than anything maybe a magic hug is what Ricky, Ricky was put on this earth to do. JJ starts openly crying too and just goes like,"
"JJ: [sniffs, wipes a tear] Thanks man, thanks man."
"Zac: I like, I think, try to like mentally make Ox come too."
"Brennan: [barks] Ox bounds through the thing he's like,"
"JJ: Oh, what's up your magic dog! [wiping his eyes] Fuuuck, man. [rough voice] Fuck."
Ricky: He's pretty...
"JJ: [through tears] Yeah, man, so righteous. [sniffs]"
Ricky: Watch this.
Zac: And I throw a frisbee in the air and make him bound off my shoulder to catch it in his tiny room.
"Brennan: Bounds off your shoulder. You and JJ have a fucking great time. You eat Chinese food until you're fuckin' sick. It's so good, it's the, it's just the perfect food for a warm stomach. You, you see that he eventually turns, he starts playing the video games and like, basically he's just, just like talking with you through the levels and ends up like putting the controller in your hands and walking you through like easy mode."
Ricky: What am I doing? Yeah.
"JJ: Just gonna go, I'm just gonna go straight here. So this is basically the tutorial. So like there's nothing that can go super wrong in this part of the game."
"Ricky: What are these doors, do I go through them?"
"JJ: You, you can, it's very super up to you."
Ricky: I'm gonna give you the controller back.
(cast laughs)
"Brennan: He smiles, you guys get into it, JJ talks about like, you know, he's just like, man,"
"JJ: I just fuckin’ miss my family, man. It's just hard to find friends and know who to trust."
Brennan: Give me Insight and Perception real quick.
Zac: Insight and Perception?
"Brennan: Yeah, two different checks."
Zac: So this is my Perception.
"Brennan: And go ahead and do them, and Insight do with advantage."
"Zac: Okay, Perception I got a 22."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Insight...natural 20.
"Brennan: Ooooh, baby."
Murph: Yes!
Siobhan: Noice.
Ally: Yes!
Zac: [attempting to lift his d20 to the camera] I knocked it over.
"Brennan: You're at 22 for Perception. First of all, you notice stuff on JJ's computer about the Met, about the Metropolitan Museum. There's, you see this stuff for the first time. About the Metropolitan Museum of Art there, and you see his insight is he suddenly feels like there's a secret he wants to share and you immediately on a 20, you just get it. Something in your heart opens up. You, Ricky is on this emotional wavelength and I think too, that Ricky, again, like you are growing, you are not the guy you were three years ago and you had this moment where you just tap into him and you're like, JJ is very scared. He's very alone, Ana and Amelia are awesome but they don't have their, their personal life is very different than JJ’s. They're not interested in the same stuff and Esther is so busy and stressed. Any free time she gets, she devotes to making sure your guys' relationship is succeeding and okay. That you see JJ feeling very frightened of something and on a Nat 20, you know that he is thinking about Tony Simos, you can just tell."
"Zac: Well, first off, he sighs very deeply and says,"
"Ricky: I guess we should do a boys' night, you know with me, you and Pete and… uh… [strained] Cody—"
[Murph laughs]
"Ricky: And besides that, is there someone, can I ask about, is someone bothering you right now?"
"JJ: No, um… I s— look, I owe everything to Esther, right? Like Esther… [a little shaky] it's just a lot of fucking pressure to like, make this all worth it, right? Like I fuckin’ know that Gladiator is an evil fuckin’ company. Like I know that, but like if I can't make the sacrifice to get me here to New York worth it, like then like it's fucked up. Like I need to be able to do that for my family. People are counting on me, [quick breath] you know."
"Zac: I'm gonna cast Calm Emotions on him, just to like help him chill out, just a…"
"Brennan: A shoulder— [mimes JJ’s shoulder going down from a panic position] Yeah, he relaxes, he goes,"
"JJ: Thanks, man. I feel a little bit brave around you, around you."
"Ricky: It's my aura, yeah."
"JJ: Shit, I thought you were just like that chill of a per— well, I guess magically you are that chill of a person."
"Ricky: Magically I am that, yeah."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"JJ: So basically like, look I've been scrambling for a little while like I'm almost done with grad school. I made like virtually no friends here. I didn't have dick in common with any of the fuckin’ people in my program, who are all like Ivy League kids, which I am too, like I said, I have to own that, right. Like that's also me. But the main thing was like, I owe everything to Esther for inducting me into the society but, nobody said the stuff that Pete said to us at the meeting, right? Like that was weird. Remember Pete on the, on the Staten Island ferry was kind of like, and I know the Esther super trusts Sofia and Sofia super trusts Pete but that guy, Tony, he was really, he was really super nice to me at first, but he's been kind of pushy recently over text messages."
"[quicker, more panicked] I feel like I fucked up, I fucked up with the Gladiator thing, like I shouldn't have sent that research into them. I just thought that I didn't even get the fucking internship and I just thought like, it's one of the few paying internships and if you get that on your resume, you can get hired anywhere and like, I ended up talking to Tony at the monastery, I don't know if you, do you super trust Sofia and Pete because I had a Detect Magic spell on and I looked at Tony, both of them cast magic on Tony and it was magic like, like battle magic, like and, and I, I, I just think it wasn't sure, like maybe they were lying to Esther or something and Tony kind of asked me to, and then he, I got him, I gave him my number and I just was like, Tony seemed like, I don't know if I did I fuck up? I truly don't—"
"Ricky: Yeah, yeah, it's… I don't think you fucked up, it's really... I've been told I'm a very simple guy, but the situation is honestly pretty complicated. And there's a lot of factors going on that I clearly don't fully understand but yeah, I think from your perspective, that's a confusing moment but I trust Pete and Sofia implicitly and I think we kind of... Just to be honest? 'Cause I don't want you to be caught up too much in this stuff, that we don't really trust that Tony guy very much."
"JJ: I feel really dumb, man. He, he got way pushier over text. Like at first he was so chill, he was like, if you ever need any help, I'm here to help you. He was just one of the first people that was like, talking to me?"
"Brennan: And you see that, that loneliness, that like magical loneliness, seep back into JJ for a second [static-y background noise, like wind rushing in your ears] and, and your aura like repels it away from him, but it's there for a moment as he talks about being lonely. And he goes,"
"JJ: And like I just told him at first he was just like, “hey, what's up?” He's like, “what do you think about those people?” And I was so freaked out cause I was like, does Esther know that like Sofia and Pete are like casting battle magic on their allies? I couldn't tell if she knew and like but then I didn't want to ruin a friendship and I didn't want to get like Sofia or Pete mad at me. Frankly, Sofia seems like, super scary to me. [laughs nervously] She seems like, really, really powerful."
"Brennan: And he's like,"
"JJ: And Pete seems like a really chill dude but also like, I straight up know how powerful that dude is. Like I read about Vox Phantasma in the past. Those dudes are not always super chill! And you know, like I basically looked at Tony and, and told him about those spells and then he was like, look, he's like, “it's all good and he was like, you're clearly a good guy. Esther's a good person but Esther just doesn't have the judgment around people like a monk would have” and I was like, that makes sense. Like, like academic people, he was like super nice about Esther and he was super nice about you. He was like, “Ricky's clearly a good guy” and I was like, okay, that kind of makes sense. And then he was like, “hey, we need to be on our lookout because we don't wanna, we don't wanna bum Esther out with this stuff, but we need to be ready in case anyone tries to make a go for the, for the Society or the Order.” You know, what are the defenses that the Gramercy Occult Society has? Like what, like how does the Umbral Engine really kind of work? And at first I was like, oh, here's loosely what I know and then he started being like, “well, can you look up more?” And it just, [runs his hand through his hair] and now he's been like kind of angrily sort of texting me for the past, like, couple of days. Being like, “hey, like why, like why the radio silence” but I just didn't know who to talk about it to."
"Ricky: Well, you know, I, I honestly have been taking it for my friend's word that this guy sucked as much as he did, but now I know he sucks. What a weird shithead, I usually don't say stuff like that."
Ally: [high-pitched] A shithead!
"Brennan: [laughing] It's a day, it's a day for us, this is Ricky's version of Kingston's proclamation that Gladiator dies, Ricky saying."
"Ricky: [whispering] Shhh, real shithead. Wow, yeah it's it's I, I kind of forget that we really threw you into it, well, that's, that's really messed up."
"JJ: I haven't, I didn't say like, I can show you my texts. I showed him some basic stuff."
"Brennan: He goes over to his computer, moves the stuff about the Met to the side."
"Zac: Can we look at that by the way, real fast?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you look at it real quick. He goes, oh, he's like,"
"JJ: This is not, this is just, I'm fuckin around with, I read this whole thing about the Cloisters shutting down. They, they ended up taking all the stuff out of the Cloisters and moving it to the main Met, and also after everything else I found out, they're actually displaying all this stolen Native art and items there. And you know, it's just like, there are so many tribes and families that created and cherish that art who had it stolen from them and they deserve to have it returned. So I was kind of planning on doing like a solo expedition 'cause now that I can like turn invisible and teleport and do other shit, I was sort of planning on going into the Met at night both because that would be fucking rad. And second to just straight up steal a whole bunch of Native American art and then return it."
Ricky: Hell yeah.
JJ: So that was sort of my game plan. If you... would be down.
"t Nat 20 Insight, I think you can see that, that the Cloisters closing down was big news and this might be unrelated in terms of, of the Cloisters closing, that was very big news. So there's an element to the stuff with JJ where like, everyone's kind of been talking about the Cloisters closing but it does look wild to you, because you know, those unicorn tapestries are very important and if they're all at the Met now, that's huge."
Zac: It's a reflection of the… dreamworld.
"Brennan: It's a reflection of the dream world, exactly."
"Ricky: Whoa, um, yeah, I mean I'm down for whatever dude. Let's, I would say down to clown but I had a bad experience with some clowns today."
"Brennan: JJ, JJ looks at you and goes like,"
"JJ: Hell yeah, man, I'm super down to clown. And I, I really appreciate you being a good friend, man. I,"
"Brennan: You see, he starts crying a little bit again and just goes like,"
"JJ: This city, it's like the city of dreams, right, like, people move here to make their dreams come true but that's so fuckin lonely so much of the time, man. And I feel like you always hear the stories of the people who made it and the people that didn't make it. So many of them just like fall off, and I don't know man. I felt pretty frazzled and I feel better now and I, and I'm sorry if I fucked anything up and I'll make it right."
"Ricky: Hey, no worries, just make sure you take care of yourself and let's keep hanging."
"JJ: Hell yeah, man, I love it."
"Brennan: Awesome, Cool, that's yours, for everyone else that was, I wasn't expecting anyone to go talk to JJ!"
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: That was a cool, that was a cool important thing that Ricky discovered there, awesome. Everyone else real quick, Iga, your, your Thanksgiving is a delightful, huge Polish celebration. Pierogies abound, and you see Jess and Nick are having a great time and you, you look at your daughter and see a sort of glimmer of magic around her and feel your own sort of connection to, to the chest. Give me an Arcana check, if you'd be so kind."
Siobhan: Mm-hm. It's a 10.
[gentle jazz]
"Brennan: You hear faint whispering and on a 10, give me an Insight check as well."
"Siobhan: Maybe I'll use my last luck point. Still not great, an 11."
"Brennan: You hear faint whispering coming from your mothers and your mother's mothers. And for a moment you think they're talking about Jessica but on a 10 and an 11, you push those whisperings away because your daughter's having a wonderful time. You're here with family and life is good. Real quick at the Brown family Thanksgiving, Kingston, what is, what's Kingston up to that night at Thanksgiving, obviously a huge momentous day for Kingston but now he's surrounded by family on all sides."
"Lou: I think it's like, I think there's almost, there's almost like a stealing of self for like, let's enjoy this moment because as of tomorrow… I'm hellbent. And there's only one thing that will satisfy me. So I think like tonight is I think like Kingston, even like undoes one more button on his collared shirt and like starts the night off with like a glass of wine."
"Brennan: Incredible, a glass of wine, Liz has her arm around you, Liz and your mom are talking so happily together."
"Lou: I think I introduce Cody to some of my younger cousins and I'm like,"
"Kingston: Boys, this one, he loves the, the games y'all always talking about. I think he plays them too. Ain't that right, Cody?"
"Cody: Yeah, mostly I'm PC gamer but I also do PS4 and stuff. I don't know if you guys do that."
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me a Persuasion check, Cody."
Lou: Can I give Cody the help action?
Brennan: Yes you can.
"Murph: Cody has okay Persuasion I think, let me see..."
"Emily: Oh yeah, charismatic paladin."
Siobhan: All those years in retail.
"Murph: Yeah, he's just intense. Oh my God, a nat 1 and a 7, so 11."
"Brennan: Kingston, there is...you are magically gifted with the ability to speak for the city. You look at your cool young cousins, gather around at Thanksgiving and walk over with Cody, say your piece and immediately go like, this is a hard sell."
(cast laughs)
"Cody: I guess to say, I play video games is a little bit of an understatement."
"Brennan: Kingston, you get a look from your, from your cousins being like out of respect for you, we will make your friend feel comfortable here at Thanksgiving."
"Lou: I give them a nod back like, thank you. I will repay you in kind, and I move on to another part."
Ally: Can I?
"Brennan: Yeah, Pete, go for it."
"Ally: Oh, can I just show up with a bunch of like, really funky potentially like unpalatable natural wine that I'm trying to get Kingston to drink?"
"Brennan: [laughs] Yes, absolutely, Pete shows up with natural wine."
"Ally: Just the hippest, fucking like, kombucha-like wine that I'm like,"
Kingston: What is this?
"Pete: Oh, this one is incredible."
"Kingston: Yeah, but I don't know. What's all the stuff floating around in it?"
"Pete: Yeah, put that red one down, you got to try this one. It's incredible, see this brand new 20 year old just took over a winery, a whole vineyard and he has this whole new way of doing it."
Kingston: What’s a 20-year-old know about wine? I drink wine that is older than that child on a regular basis.
"Pete: He is completely disrupting the wine industry, okay, Kingston you gotta try it."
Kingston: Is that a good thing? Does is need to be disrupted?
Pete: [making a cheers] Happy Thanksgiving.
"Lou: Okay, sure, happy Thanksgiving."
Zac: A brand new 20 year old.
": Incredible, let me get, you see that Pete you are immediately pulled into, you are immediately pulled into the party, Victoria just grabs you, pinches the hell out of your cheeks gives you a big kiss. She is like an absolute ninja with helpings of food. Every time a plate is clean, a new plate flies into your hand, just smiling. And you see as the night winds on, Winston appears, Kingston's father goes,"
"Winston: All right, young blood, how are you feeling tonight my friend?"
"Pete: I'm feeling like whipping some ass, let's go"
"Winston: Oh, whippin some— okay. (laughs) Let's get some ass whipped!"
Pete: I've just gotten way too comfortable as though this is my own grandfather.
"Brennan: Incredible. You, okay, Winston is gonna roll with advantage due to being on home court."
Zac: Are we going to Roll20? Are we gonna...?
Brennan: We are gonna— [laughs]
"Ally: Oh, I don’t have Roll20 open. God."
"Lou: You guys got a battlemap for this, right?"
"Brennan: Winston's gonna roll, he has double proficiency in dominoes. So he's gonna roll with a plus 12 to this roll. He hit a Nat 20, I'm not kidding. Go ahead and make your roll, Pete. You gotta hit a Nat 20 to, to survive."
Ally: A 19!
(cast laughs)
Siobhan: Oh no.
"Brennan: You're playing so well, you get so far, you decide— Winston will"
clean you out for truly any amount of money you are willing to put down.
"Ally: I think I put down like, like a- I think we're up to like $80, like stupid where I'm just like ruining my, the rest of the month for myself."
"Brennan: It's like the end of the month, December rent. It's gonna come through on the first, yeah."
"Pete: It’s fine, like, I'll make it back, one more, man so much respect."
Pete takes a drink.
"Brennan: Kingston, you see your dad out on the stoop and towards the end of the night with the other old timers, smoking a cigar, waving a stack, very small stack of bills in the air."
"Kingston: Dad, you got to give that money back to Pete."
"Winston: Why, why, why? Based on what?"
"Kingston: Why are we doing this again this year? All we doing this every year, either I chase him down and make him give you money back or I chase you down and make you give money back, right either way, Pete needs that for rent!"
"Brennan: As you say that, your dad gives you a death glare. As you bring up the one year that Pete won in front of his friends, his old friends out on the stoop."
Ally laughs smugly.
"Kingston: What you don't, you don't tell your friends about the year a white boy beat you? You don’t tell, you don’t tell ‘em about—"
"Winston: Okay, you wanna go inside, let's go inside, you wanna have business out in front of my friends, make a fool of me out on the stoop! Thanksgiving!"
"Brennan: You see that he gets up, walks in with you and, and literally hands you the $80, says,"
"Winston: [subdued] I don't want, I know that Pete is on the straight and narrow and he's working, he's working an honest job, so that's fine. Please don't bring up the time he beat me in front of my friends."
"Kingston: All right, hey, I only do what I have to and if you don't make me go there, I won't go there. I understand what that means, all right. I understand the depth of pain that, that creates in you, all right. Just don't make me go there, all right pop?"
"Brennan: [clapping] He shakes his head, ruefully smiles. Pats you on the arm, gives you the money. At a certain point in the night Sofia you're also here. This is like a great place for Sofia to be on a holiday, surrounded by loving people and—"
"Emily: I think I'm just like, I think I'm like lingering to see, to try to talk to Kingston but he's like very busy. So then I think I just busy myself with like doing all the dishes."
Brennan: Oh.
"Ally: Oh, I think with the wine, I brought like a really great like elderberry seltzer or something, knowing that you would be here so that you would have like a non-alcoholic version at the party."
Emily: I take it from Pete.
"Ally: Just being like,"
Pete: This is so good.
Emily: Very gratefully.
"Brennan: Incredible, as you start washing dishes, you feel an iron grip on your arm and look down and see Kingston's mother, who looks up, who has, I think in the course of a season and a half of the show has only ever been all sunshine. She looks up at you with a look that Kingston got maybe twice in his entire childhood and goes,"
"Victoria: [piercing stare] Sweetheart, what are you doing in my kitchen?"
"Sofia: Victoria, please tell me what I can do to help. I am trying to keep my hands busy. Can I help in any way?"
"Victoria: Sure thing sweetheart, there's a half a pecan pie left, three quarters of a pumpkin, it looks like a slice of apple."
"Sofia: Oh, you want me to put it in Tupperware?"
"Victoria: [staring terrifyingly] Sweetheart, you know I love you. This is not a game. This is real. And you need to go and enjoy yourself. You understand?"
Emily: I respectfully go finish off the pecan pie.
(cast laughs)
Zac: You eat half a pie?
Victoria: Thanks!
Brennan: She gives a little kiss.
"Victoria: Oh, sweetheart, wonderful, thank you so much."
Lou: Do I just find Sofie eating like what is essentially a quarter of a pecan pie?
"Brennan: Yes, near the kitchen you find Sofie there."
"Kingston: I mean, it's good pie, right?"
"Sofia: It's really good, yeah, I love pecan pie, especially your mother’s."
"Kingston: She does, she does do it right."
"Brennan: Sofie, you see that your mom is well into some glasses and is just talking with Kingston's mom being like, just talking to Kingston's mom about life and having kids in the city and yada, yada. Sofia go ahead and make a Medicine check for me, if you'd be so kind, call it a DC 15 medicine check."
"Emily: 17 plus, hold on, I mean, I got a 17, so whatever it adds to Medicine is fine."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Negative 8?
Emily: Dirty 20.
"Brennan: Dirty 20, hell yeah. Sofia you look at your mom and your mom is talking about she's like,"
"Maria: 9 and a half months, I was carrying Sofia. She did not want to come out, I'm telling you the truth."
"Brennan: You, your mom talking about that, I think Sofia realizes what you and I were talking about over text prior to the session beginning. Sofia recognized this, something about her timeline over the past month and a half since the campaign started, a month since the campaign started."
"Emily: Uhhh… hmm. I think, I think, I think my first thought is probably, oh my God, I'm going through menopause."
(cast laughs)
"Brennan: So yeah, well, Sofia, Sofia realizes that she's like about two weeks late, behind schedule."
"Emily: Wow, that is a blow, if I'm... okay, I guess I, yeah, I'm trying to think. I think Sofia. Yeah, okay."
Emily: Yeah. I think she does not say anything out loud or act upon it in any way.
"Brennan: Cool, chill, you enjoy the rest of your evening."
"Ally: Can I go, I go to Sofia with like a seltzer water with bitters and a lime squirt and be like,"
"Pete: This is the move. If you haven't tried this, it is the most herbal and refreshing beverage, here you go."
Sofia: Bitters has a little bit of alcohol in it.
"Pete: Oh, you know what, you're totally right."
Sofia: Can I get one without the bitters?
"Pete: Oh, yeah yeah yeah, here's a seltzer with some lime."
"Ally: And I like, I start drinking the bitters one,"
Pete: Here you go.
"Sofia: Thank you so much, thank you."
"Pete: Yeah, for sure."
"Sofia: Do I look old to you, do I look of menopausal age to you?"
"Pete: What? No, not at all. ...Wait, I'm sorry. Are you coming on to me?"
"Emily: Okay, I chug the seltzer—"
(cast laughs)
"Pete: Cause, I had an issue with Rowan. Make sure you're comfortable."
"Sofia: You're right, that was so inappropriate of me just now… I’m sorry. The holidays just make me so horny."
(cast laughs)
Pete’s jaw drops.
"Sofia: I’m so sorry, Pete."
"Brennan: Thanksgiving dinner is getting wild. People are enjoying, lots of music playing, people are laughing, dancing. The Brown family holidays are unparalleled in New York City. Just people all in all the levels of the stairwell up through Claude's apartment into Victoria and Winston's, Liz is so happy. Liz comes over and says hi to Sofia. Cody, you're there, Josh is there as well. Cody, yeah you see Josh is here too. I don't think you've had a chance to confront yet about Gladiator stuff. You see, he says,"
"Josh: Hey, dude I'm, I heard you were asking for like a house meeting and stuff. Look, I just wanted to say like..."
Cody: Yeah.
"Josh: I'm super sorry, it's just that, like, I was working at PacSun for way less. I know that you, you still have like a month or two of unemployment, right?"
Cody: Yeah.
"Josh: I don't like I'm, I'm gonna run out. Gladiator's one of the only places that’s hiring, it's not a lot of money but it's just like, I don't know what else to do, man. Like my resume's, like PacSun, and that's pretty much it."
"Cody: I get it, Josh, but like, the mall's gonna come back and when it does PacSun's gonna be like the second or third place to open after Hot Topic and I think it's important in these… Just, Gladiator's fucked up, man. It's, it's gonna take over the whole city in like ways that I can't totally explain 'cause you're gonna think that I'm making a bunch of it up 'cause I say fuckin wild shit, awesome stuff all the time. But even on just like the regular level of just like buying up all these places and everything, it's just gonna like fuck everything up. So I get that you're in like a fucked up place and stuff and that we live in like a weird room with a sheet and it sucks ass, but like, if, if you could just if you just like chill for like a little while longer, I think, I think we'll be able to figure it out. I think Gladiator's not gonna be around forever."
Brennan: Give me a very high DC Persuasion check. You're trying to persuade someone to not make rent.
Murph: 16.
"Brennan: Josh looks at you and says,"
"Josh: Man, if you can find me another job, I'll take it."
Cody: I can definitely find you another job.
"Josh: Okay, yeah, man, I'll quit. I'll quit the Gladiator job, if you find me something else, dude."
"Cody: You already got the job. I saw the application, dude."
"Josh: They hired me, man. I'm gonna be working in the new warehouse. I got to go out to training and Connecticut tomorrow. I gotta like, you see."
"Cody: Josh they fucking, they killed the mall, dude!"
"Josh: Dude, I don't, I don't wanna work at PacSun forever and you just didn't want to work at Hot Topic forever, dude."
"Cody: I don't know who you are right now. You're like fucking, like a fucking antelope that's turning into a lion or you are joining your families were antelopes and the lions ate them and now you're on the lion side, dude. You're a fucking Lannister. That's what you are, dude."
Brennan: Josh excuses himself and leaves.
"Cody: FUCK!!! Sorry. I'm sorry everyone. [puts his hands on his head, leans back in frustration, then runs his hands down his face]"
Brennan: We are gonna end that evening and go—
"Emily: Actually, can I have one thing to do at the end of the evening?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Emily: Okay, I think that I go home with my mother and then once she goes to bed, I wanna like Shadow Step into a empty drug store, steal a pregnancy test but replace it with money, and then Shadow Step back home. I'm not gonna use it though, I just bought it."
"Brennan: Cool, you bought it, you come back. Your mom is smiling, she was like,"
"Maria: You know, sweetheart."
Emily: I Minor Illusion it to be Sour Patch Kids.
"Brennan: Great, she goes,"
"Maria: Sweetheart, a lot of, there were a lot of young men at that Thanksgiving party, shoulda said hi. I know your friend Kingston would have introduced you to somebody."
Sofia: I know.
Maria: [woozily] You're so beautiful.
"Sofia: Honestly, I made a pretty hard pass at Pete and it didn't work out."
Ally is shaking their head.
"Maria: You know, Pete's nice, you two…"
Sofia: He’s very handsome.
Maria: Very handsome.
"Sofia: Very handsome, young for me."
"Brennan: Your mom, your mom is asleep."
"Ally: Pete has no idea why, but he just [mimes jerking awake] shot up in bed."
(laughs)
"Brennan: The next, the next morning comes, Sofia, you have an early appointment at the Monastery of the Midnight Sun."
"Emily: Okay, I go to it. I grab my little bag and go to it."
"Brennan: You walk into a central chamber. There is an enormous statue of a seated New Yorker, holding a Concrete Fist in their hand. You see that the mantra written beneath them in the stone ""Fuhgeddaboutit"" as this person sits in, contemplation. Seated in front of the statue is Cindy, to either side is Nadia and Solomon. Monks are seated up on the walls because the gravity affects the walls, You see that they're seated, they're leaning back to view beneath them down to you and you see, not seated but kneeling off of the carpet because he does not have a position at the monastery currently, but still not with the other monks, is Tony, as you walk into this room."
"Emily: I think the first thing I wanna do is I just wanna do an Insight check on Cindy because I have really done, I have really trusted her and I want to continue to trust her and I want to make sure I'm not misguided. And I got a, oh no, it's a 7, I got 10."
"Brennan: You got a 10 on your insight. Cindy has an expression you've never seen on her face before. She is stone-faced right now. She is the abbess of this monastery charged with its upkeep, protection, the, the sanctity of the Order itself."
Emily: Okay.
"Sofia: [subdued] Hey, I'm here to talk."
"Brennan: She gestures to a place of honor in the center of a circle before the statue but also a place where you are the focal point for the room, far away from everybody else. You are, you know, it's kind of like a witness stand a little bit."
"Emily: Yeah, I got that vibe, I take it."
[somber music]
"Brennan: Cindy, looks up at you and says,"
"Cindy: First Fist of the Monastery of the Midnight Sun, chosen one, Sofia Lee, did you place a curse on a member of this order?"
Sofia: I did.
Cindy: Were guests of yours also guilty of placing magic on members of this order?
"Sofia: Yeah, they were."
"Brennan: She nods and says,"
Cindy: It has come to our attention that in the grand sharing of resources that occurred between the Gramercy Occult Society and the Order of the Concrete Fist that an extremely relevant piece of information was shared on the Staten Island ferry approaching the monastery but was not shared at the actual meeting that the Vox Phantasma withheld information about the presence of dangerous dream entities from the Order. Do you understand this to be true?
"Sofia: At the time, I was unaware because I was not on the ferry, but I have since learned it to be true."
"Brennan: You see, she looks over at Tony. Tony stands up, takes out his phone, plays the recording."
"Sofia: The order has fuckin' lot to learn from, it is what it could be."
"Brennan: Cindy looks at you and says,"
"Cindy: In my position, Sofia… what would you do?"
"Sofia: [a little roughly] I would encourage me to step down from the First Fist, and if you chose to take more extreme action, I would respect that."
"Brennan: Cindy looks over at Tony, Tony looks back at Cindy, give me an Insight check."
Emily: 15.
"Brennan: Tony's holding it down, but he's mad and you know why he's mad. You are comporting yourself perfectly right now."
[Emily grins happily]
"Brennan: He wanted you to come in here and step in it and you're doing anything but that. Cindy looks up and says,"
Cindy: You are one of the most gifted monks and heroes I have ever had the pleasure to know.
Sofia: Thank you. I... I have your direction to thank for that.
"Brennan: You see, she, she says,"
Cindy: You are relieved of your position. As—
Sofia: I understand.
"Brennan: As she nods, Tony speaks up, looks at Cindy and just goes,"
Tony: And the cat?
"Brennan: You see that Cindy looks over and goes,"
"Cindy: Discussions amongst the leadership of the monastery have been held. You are relieved of your position as First Fist. The presence of the great cat within the monastery, some believe to be a breach of the security of this place. If you wish to remain as, if you wish to retain access to the monastery and remain as a junior member. We would require your renunciation of your pact with La Gran Gata."
[somber music]
"Sofia: I think part of me… [sighs] I think part of me stepping down is me saying, I'm not gonna come around. I think that I've, I've hopefully made clear what I see as a possible future in relations between the dreaming and the waking and I think, I think if you ever start to see some wisdom in that, you can reach out to me but I will… I have..."
Emily: I turn to Nadia.
"Sofia: I've learned so much from your libraries and Cindy, I've learned so much from you. And if, if I have to choose between you and magic, I will choose the magic and perhaps that is a validation of the fact that you asked me to step down."
"Brennan: La Gran Gata swirls around your shoulders and the eyes peer out slitted and narrow, gazing right at Tony, baby. La Gran Gata does not make any mysteries about it, vanishes. Nadia is fully crying. Go ahead, Sofia, make a Persuasion check with advantage, if you'd be so kind. There's no, there's no, no bad roll here can hurt what's going on."
Emily: 16.
"Brennan: 16, the way you have comported yourself here, your honesty in this moment, the fact that you didn't shirk from any of the things that were presented, you watch the monks here. They, you do not see stern looks of condemnation from everybody. You see the monks here, all look like they're deep in their own heads. Some people here probably really agree with Tony. Some people here probably really agree with you. It looks like Nadia does. Nadia is looking messed up by this and it looks like a lot of the other monks are really confused, because they've heard what Tony has to say and now looking at you, the portrait that has been painted of you clearly does not stack up with the woman who just stood bravely in front of the entire Order and said what she felt to be true. You… prepare to leave this place. It's, you don't have much here. With that 16 though, Nadia meets you at the front gate. Inside, you can hear a noise go up. (chimes resound) You hear a ringing of chimes that you understand to mean a new First Fist of the monastery has been chosen, by which we mean an old First Fist of the monastery has been chosen."
[Lou groans]
"Brennan: Nadia rushes out to the gate. It's like bright, midday. She says,"
Nadia: [wipes tears] We're gonna figure something out. I know we will.
"Sofia: [a little shaky] Yeah, I'm serious, don't worry about me, okay. You can just keep an, you keep an eye on the Order. Don't talk to me because I could spoil your position in there, and right now we need someone making sure that he can't do whatever it is he wants, and I don't even fully understand what he wants."
"Brennan: She looks, hearing this advice from you, she says,"
Nadia: Starting... after right now.
"Brennan: And she takes Forms of the Greater Dreaming, stolen from the library, puts it in your hands and says,"
"Nadia: He shouldn't have this, go."
"Emily: I think that's a real, this feels really disrespectful. However, Forms of the Greater Dreaming is how to kill Nod, right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Sofia: I'm so sorry. If anyone finds out, I'll say I stole it myself."
Emily: And I put it in my bag and I go.
"Brennan: Sofia Lee leaves the Monastery of the Midnight Sun, hoo!"
Lou: [sighs] Damn.
"Brennan: Sofia, you, you get a text from Esther, probably like an hour later saying,"
"Esther: Please give me a call as soon as possible, are you okay?"
"Emily: Yeah, I give her a call."
"Brennan: She goes,"
"Esther: Sofie, we just heard from Cindy that you're no longer with the Order, what happened?"
"Sofia: Yeah, so you know how Pete and I went a little aggro on Tony but probably for good reasons but we probably could have done it above the table in a better way? Well, that's just like directly in violation of a lot of Order policies. So they asked me to step down, and I believe they installed Tony as the First Fist but..."
Esther: Jesus.
"Sofia: Yeah, I mean, it's all my fault. I played exactly into exactly what he needed. So I did everything he needed to do. He needed me to do so if anything, I was the best part of his fucking plan."
"Esther: Sofie... name what you want me to do. There, they're at, they sent us this thing, like it was a whatever email. They sent it to us like, “hey staff change. Sofia is no longer with us. See you literally tomorrow for working on the expedition, like.”"
"Sofia: They still want in on the expedition? I thought that literally they would be like, oh, we're not investigating Dreaming. I thought they didn't give a shit about Dreaming."
Esther: That's not what they seem to be saying.
"Sofia: Oh, they're gonna go in with bad intentions. I think that we need to just start. We need to fucking send a fake expedition with them, or something. We, they, I mean, they can't be involved."
"Esther: Sof, if you want me to set up a decoy, I'm on it. I am loyal to you."
Emily: Can I just do an Insight to make sure this is absolutely Esther on the phone?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it give me an Insight check."
"Emily: [laughing] I feel paranoid right now, 18."
"Brennan: 18, yeah, I mean, it's Esther's phone. You're on the phone with her, she says, she says, look, she's like,"
"Esther: Let's, let's round up the troops. This is a big deal."
"Sofia: Yeah, I know, I fucked up, I'm really sorry."
"Esther: No, you didn't fuck up, this is not a fuck up. This is… This is fucked up."
"Brennan: Cool, Esther is basically asking you to come talk in person with her."
"Emily: Yeah, yeah."
Brennan: Would anybody else have done anything that morning in particular?
"Ally: I mean, I would love to go to the Met but I don't know if that's like a bigger trip to try to look at those memories."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool, do you want to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Memories in Nod? Or... so, yeah. I'll go ahead and say. You start to head out. Esther looks at you, Ricky, and is like, just like in, in your apartment that morning, she's like,"
"Esther: Sofia's out of the Order. They like, she like left, or stepped down but it was sort of like asked to step down."
"Ricky: Okay, I forget exactly how much we've talked about this but that Tony guy is… [pauses and checks behind him] a weird piece of shit."
"Brennan: She full drops her teacup, shatters on the ground, goes,"
Esther gasps dramatically.
"Ricky: I'm sorry, I'm sorry I said that."
"Esther: It's that bad, oh my God."
"Ricky: You know, it's just how I feel and..."
"Brennan: She's like, Mends the teacup back into her hand,"
Esther: Okay.
"Ricky: Look, he was, he's really given JJ a weird time. He's coming, like we also got to like, hang out with JJ."
"Esther: He's giving JJ a weird time, why? Isn't JJ busy with classes and stuff?"
"Ricky: JJ, I think, was…"
Zac: I just like tell her about all the...
"Brennan: Cool, she, you can see that she takes it hard, man 'cause it's like the, the, she is an incredible wizard, but this is the kind of thing of like running an organization and being like, it's that thing of like, she protected her heart for a very long time against becoming the fury of sorrow and then this moment of like, oh, “JJ was having a hard time and Esther kind of didn't notice”, she takes it hard, man. She, you can see it it's sort of rocks her."
"Ricky: Hey, you are dealing with-- we're all juggling a lot right now, it's we can just, you know."
Esther sighs.
"Ricky: We'll all do better going forward, it's not your fault."
"Esther: [shortly] Okay. [more genuine] Thank God for you, Ricky."
"Brennan: And she sort of like, leans her head into your shoulders. She's like,"
"Esther: Thank God, you're such a good guy. I hope you know how much just being a good guy helps."
"Ricky: You know, it is an interesting query for me."
"Brennan: [laughs] Cool, she hollers, Kingston, Pete, you both get a heads up from Esther that this has gone down. Pete, I assume you're in the same house with Cody. So he knows pretty much immediately. Iga, you wake up that morning after lovely food and everything, a lot of cleaning left to do, going back to clean up like the kitchen of the castle, you run into the portraits on the wall that are all you see there's a little bit of like fading to them and for a moment you're terrified because all of the women are gone from them."
Iga: What?
"Brennan: You look in the kitchen and see, stirring cups and making things are like more than probably like two dozen or so witches stretching back through history, looking out at you from the kitchen. Your mother looks at all of them who give a sour look and goes,"
"Iga’s Mother: [Polish grandma] Iga, we have been talking to each other. There's a big problem."
"Iga: Hi, hello hi, it's good to see you. You've been dead for a while, hi."
"Brennan: You see, she says,"
"Iga’s Mother: I know, I've been dead. It is, what else is new? Listen, we don't have time for sentiment about who has been dead for a long time."
"Iga: Okay, okay."
"Brennan: You see, she looks at you and says,"
"Iga’s Mother: Some of the mothers are complaining because, Jessica..."
"Brennan: You see this ancient woman. Your like great, great, great, great, great grandmother. Someone from, like, the middle ages goes,"
"Ancestor: [bluntly] Your daughter, she's a bad witch."
"Iga: What, how dare you, what?"
"Brennan: You see, she says,"
"Ancestor: I am allowed, I outrank 12 of you."
"Brennan: She says,"
"Ancestor: I, I can tell my daughter's, daughter's daughter's, daughter's, daughter's, daughter's, what she is and is not doing right. Your daughter, Jessica, she is a bad witch."
"Brennan: You see that another ancient sort of ghost goes,"
Ancestor: We don't ask questions about the castle. We don't ask questions about how it work. We don't go into doors in the dark. The family keeps it alive.
"Brennan: Your mother sort of plaintively looks and goes,"
"Iga’s Mother: Iga, the chest that is going out of the house all the time, so many people know about the chest. Maybe, maybe we leave this place. Something bad is happening to New York, maybe you leave New York."
"Iga: No, I know something bad is happening to the chest. That's why it is leaving and taking it to see, there are people here… It's not like Poland, it's not like Poland, mother. It's not like that."
Brennan: The whole chorus—
Iga: The Nazis are not gonna come along and steal the chest.
"Brennan: You see that your grandmother says,"
Iga’s Grandmother: You don't know that.
"Iga: I do, they're not going to!"
"Brennan: You see that all of them just start muttering. There's this chorus of voices. You see that, the oldest one, a witch from like the literal Dark Ages looks and says,"
"Dark Ages Ancestor: [very old voice] All of you are wrong, all of you are wrong. It is not Jessica who is the bad witch."
Iga: [dismissively] Boy. Here we go.
Dark Ages Ancestor: It is Iga!
"Iga: Yes, okay I'm bad, I hear it, I'm bad, I’m so bad."
"Dark Ages Ancestor: Of course your daughter, of course your daughter would do these crazy spells to look in the doors, explore the castle, go wake up whatever is sleeping in the dungeons, like a crazy person! Of course she would do this because she grows up..."
"Iga: Did she wake anything up, did she wake anything up, did she?"
"Dark Ages Ancestor: You'll know that she wants to and that's bad enough, Iga Lisowski!"
"Iga: No, she does not want to wake anything up. She just wants to know."
"Brennan: You see all of them in unison say,"
Iga’s Ancestors: And that is the problem!
"Brennan: You see, your mother says,"
"Iga’s Mother: Iga, look, it is not wrong to know but it is dangerous to find out, we just, Jessica has grown up in this crazy place where she is meeting young vampires and wizards who are filling her all these sorts of things. The chest was not protected for centuries by running around and showing the chest to everybody. You dragged the chest from Poland where it was safe. You bring it to New York where you raise your family here and now they are playing on their XBOXes and they are—"
"Iga: They don't have an XBOX, where are you coming, where are you hearing of this XBOX?"
Iga’s Mother: One of the imps in the belfry said that Jessica had an XBOX.
"Iga: Why would, no, I— no, my children do not have an XBOX."
"Brennan: You see that again, the ancient, ancient..."
"Iga: What, tell me what an XBOX is? Tell me what you think an XBOX is?"
"Brennan: You see the ancient witch goes,"
Dark Ages Ancestor: Dangerous magic. That is what an Xbox is.
"Iga: Okay, you're right, you're right, that is what an XBOX is. That's why they don't have one."
"Brennan: You see that... Iga, what's Iga feeling in this moment facing this scorn and derision from all of these ghosts?"
"Siobhan: Sort of, like, in that way that you always do when you're around your family, like kind of regressing a little bit and remembering all of the moments when she was young, when she was like, why do we have to hide this? Why does it have to be a secret? Like those like moments of frustration and also like, you don't get to tell me how to raise my daughter."
"Brennan: Yeah, give me."
"Iga: You think you did such a good job, you can tell me—"
"Brennan: Yeah, give me an Insight check, Iga. Give me one with advantage."
Siobhan: [sucks in a breath] This one is...
Zac: Do you got any luck points?
"Siobhan: I do have a luck point, I'm gonna use a luck point."
Brennan: Go for it.
"Siobhan: I rolled a 1 and a 7. I'm gonna use a luck point. Okay, there we go, there we go, 25."
"Brennan: 25, Iga… They're right. Jessica's not the weird one, and their criticism of Jessica is making you pissed, not only because “who the fuck are you to tell me how I'm raising my kid?” Jessica is fucking beautiful and perfect and she's great and… she's not the outlier because she was the first one in the line that got raised in a giant technological metropolis during the information age, speaking, learning Polish at home and speaking English out with her friends. You're the different one, you are the one that came here, and I think that there's a question in Iga's mind of how she relates to these women and also by the way, after the clown fight, everybody leveled up. Iga, you multi-classed into your first level of sorcerer and I think that you realize that you've been getting these warlock powers for so long by observing this relationship to this chest and the chest is separate. The chest is magical and is a source of magic and it's a source of magic that your family has used for a long, long, long time. If you wanted to do something risky you could reach out into what this chest is holding and get that magic as well."
Siobhan: How risky?
Ally lets out a breath and a little laugh off camera.
Brennan: You have dozens of ghosts telling you to be cautious in the nastiest most scoldy way possible.
Siobhan: Can I ask them if any of them have ever reached out to the power?
"Brennan: You see all of them go,"
"Ancestors: No, what do you think we are crazy?"
Iga: So who is telling you not to do it?
"Ancestors: She told me, well, she told me, well, she told me, well she told me, she told me, well, she was the one who told me."
"Brennan: And it goes all the way back into the most ancient one who goes,"
Dark Age Ancestor: I thought probably it was a bad idea.
"Iga: Oh boy, I reach into the power. I'm absolutely going to do it, you ladies, what're you doing?"
"Brennan: Boom. Iga, you connect to something ancient and powerful, slumbering. You feel fire and power, you feel mystery and legend. You feel story and deep knowledge. Most of all, you feel magic. Does Iga, go deeper to the castle? You feel that connection and feel the surge of that power but you also know some, a little thing blips on your phone and you see a message from your other allies saying that something bad has happened. Iga, can either go to explore this right now or you can, you feel this connection and as you feel it, vwoom, the rafters ring out with deep shuddering of the castle and the ghosts all [snaps] vanish and reappear static in their portraits."
Siobhan: Do I get an impression that the power is malevolent?
"Brennan: Give me an Insight— what'd you get, did you just get 25 on an Insight check?"
"Siobhan: I got a 25 on an Insight check, yeah."
"Brennan: You don't feel it's malevolent. In fact, as you feel the, the roots of the castle move, you see that raw Umbra flit out of your kitchen, hit the sky, burst apart, vaporize and get dispelled by this new gleaming power you're holding in your hands, you reached out to the thing this chest has kept captured for centuries. It doesn't feel like it's unhappy to finally have someone say hello."
Iga: Hello?
Something lets out a growling snore.
"Brennan: What type of sorcerer are you, Siobhan?"
Siobhan: Draconic bloodline.
"Brennan: Draconic bloodline, cool. We are gonna cut out to—"
Zac: It's a clown!
(cast laughs)
Brennan: It's a fucking clown.
Siobhan: Growly the clown.
"Brennan: Okay, everybody else gathers together. I would say they keep it, keep it fucking secret and Esther is like,"
"Esther: Come to me and Ricky's spot, come to the clock tower."
"Brennan: Sofia, Cody, Pete...Kingston, what are you doing the next day? I mean, you probably get this text early in the morning."
"Lou: Yeah, can I call Tony?"
"Brennan: Oh, sure, yeah. You have Tony's number."
"Lou: Yeah, I call Tony."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Tony: Hey Mr. Brown, how's it going my friend, good to hear from you."
"Kingston: Hey, what's up, man, I just wanted to talk about some of the changes that I've heard are going on at the Order."
"Brennan: He says,"
"Tony: Yeah, yeah, that was, that was hard. I don't know if you were aware that the Vox Phantasma or that Sofia cast combat magic on me or that they kept those secrets. You, you traveled on the ferry with everybody, right?"
Kingston: I did.
"Tony: Yeah, so what do you think about not sort of volunteering that information the Vox Phantasma had?"
"Kingston: I mean, I think that the Vox Phantasma speaks for the dreams and if the dreams choose not to speak, that's their choice."
"Tony: All right, I understand that. Well, yeah, just put it this way that it, you know, it doesn't make the Order feel very secure, you know, we're putting all of our ancient texts on the line, our scrolls. We're putting our bodies on the line to defend the city and the people in it and you know, to not share that kind of thing. It does come across as a choice, comes across as a strong choice."
"Kingston: Yeah, but you also made it incredibly clear to me, how much distaste you had for Pete is that...we can agree to that as well?"
"Tony: Distaste, I don't have control over. It is what it is. But my actions are what speaks for me."
"Kingston: Well, that's why I called you because actions are important, but the thing you need to understand is that I am the voice of the people of New York. As far as I'm concerned, Sofia is family, Pete is family. So I want you to know that if you have a problem with them, you have a problem with me, and that needs to be handled."
Ally smiles.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Intimidate check, and I think Kingston does roll these with advantage. It's a very soft, it's a soft one but."
"Lou: “It's a soft one.” Okay, first one is a 16. Second one is less than 16."
"Brennan: You see Tony nods or no, you don't see anything on the phone but, Tony goes,"
"Tony: I understand. If I got a problem with them, I got a problem with you, and I appreciate your honesty. I don't like sneaking around behind people's backs. It's good to know where we stand. I know that you speak for New York. I hope you know that I defend New York and occasionally those two missions aren't always the same thing."
"Kingston: [nodding] What is it, yeah… Yeah, well, I guess I'll see you around."
Tony: I'll see you around.
"Brennan: Two very old-school guys, hang up the phone."
Lou: Kingston puts on his best sweater and heads to this meetup.
"Brennan: Yeah, Liz is looking... Liz looks at you and it's like,"
"Liz: Kingston, you look like you’re standing kind of tall right now, I like it, is everything all right?"
"Kingston: No, but, I don't know. Don't get me wrong, I like, I like it when things are easy, when things are fun... but it's also nice to get dirty."
(cast laughs)
"Brennan: Hell yeah, cool. Kingston, Pete, Cody, Ricky, you guys all arrive at Esther's, at Esther's place. Iga, oh, sorry you get a message from Esther being like, while you're in the castle before you get a chance to go deeper being like,"
"Esther: We should meet up right away. Tony Simos is not to necessarily be trusted, worried about him and his fascination with you and your chest. Might be safe for you to come to this address that the Order doesn't know about at your nearest convenience. Just wanna make sure that you and yours are safe. So sorry for this inconvenience."
Siobhan: What address is this?
Brennan: It's the Clinton Hill Chantry and the top apartment of it is where...
"Siobhan: Okay, great."
Brennan: ...Ricky and Esther live.
"Siobhan: Yeah, can I, my family's all there right, the day after Thanksgiving, everybody's just like lounging around eating sandwiches."
Brennan: You know it.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I think I want to put, get them all into the chest."
"Brennan: Whoa, hell yeah."
"Siobhan: And then cast a Greater Invisibility on myself, to go to... or actually, I can do Galder's Speedy Courier again."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: I'll just do Galder's Speedy Courier to go to Esther's.
"Brennan: You, you put yourself in your castle. Your box flies off to Esther's place, boom. You are all there, your family says, you're all, Oskar is like,"
Oskar: Should we stay in the castle and just have a snack while you're dealing with business or?
"Iga: Whatever you want, whatever you wanna do."
Oskar: Cool.
Iga: Jessica?
Jessica: Yes.
"Iga: No, I, there is, we got to do the sneaking around the castle together, okay."
Jessica: Yeah.
"Iga: I love you, I trust you. No, no investigations without me, okay."
"Brennan: Hell yes, oh, you see, Jessica says,"
"Jessica: Yeah, you got it, mom I'll be safe, yeah, absolutely."
The camera has been focused on only Siobhan and Brennan for quite some time; Zac and Ally are not onscreen.
"Brennan: You see, is this a Zac-Ally bit? Is this a classic Zac-Ally bit?"
Zac does an over-exaggerated stretch yawn.
Ally: Just the most audible yawn that has ever come out of me and I didn't know how to stop it.
Zac: [coughing] Excuse me.
"Brennan: Amazing, you guys meet up at Ricky and Esther's spot, beautiful loft apartment. You step out, Jessica is super excited. Iga, as you're walking out of this place, again, feeling a deeper connection to the magic than you have in a long time. You walk past, when you tap into that new magic, you dispelled that Umbral Arcana pretty effortlessly. The fading has vanished from the portraits. They are crisp and vibrant and full of color, like they had been painted just the year before."
"Iga: Can I look out the window and see what, what's going on with the forest?"
"Brennan: Got about 1,500 acres extended on all sides as the forest has moved out."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: You guys are in the apartment, as you guys meet up together."
"Sofia: I have one thing, Esther, I need a really good illusion. I need a really good illusion that we can make a video of so we can have it, okay. I need an illusion of me burning the scroll in case someone starts looking for it but I'm not actually gonna burn it, can you do that?"
"Brennan: She nods and says,"
"Esther: Yeah. I don't have that spell prepared right now but if you give me eight hours, I'm on it. I can get that done."
"Emily: Okay, and then I think I hand the scroll to Pete and I say,"
"Sofia: I didn't know whether or not to destroy this but... I, it felt wrong to destroy but I think that they'll look for it on me and it feels like something that may be it be okay if you had access to."
Ally: Do I know what this is? I can just tell that it's like how to kill Nod.
Emily: Yeah.
"Zac: I think that there's something to be said about, is it how to kill Nod or how to kill a dream… person?"
"Emily: Is it, is it specifically Nod, or is it a dream monarch?"
"Brennan: Dream monarchs, monarchs of dreaming."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Nod is the one that is referenced specifically but this is the one that had that thing that it had, it had Nod’s anatomy but then said “if encountering a monarch of dreaming.”"
"Emily: So I think like I definitely have studied it but I think that it should be, I want Pete to be able to decide what he wants to do with it."
"Pete: Cool, thank you, yeah."
"Zac: Also, also I've made 30 eggs for people because I just had a bunch of eggs and."
Lou: Hard boiled or?
"Zac: No, no, it's a big pot of scrambled."
Lou: Oh.
Pete: Delicious.
"Kingston: Hey, let's give, give it a little Sriracha, let's go to town."
"Sofia: That’s kind of gross, actually, I don’t think I want it. That’s—"
Pete: Yeah.
Ricky: I usually…
Kingston: I'm all the way in.
Zac: Yeah.
"Sofia: I'm not in, no."
Zac: Little Tupperwares of eggs.
Ally: I'm just elbow deep into some eggs. [mimes shoveling food into their mouth]
"Kingston: This is good, Ricky."
"Ricky: Thank you, it's eggs and Sriracha."
"Brennan: Incredible, you guys are all gathered here. You see, hold on one second. Oh, so Esther looks out and says,"
"Esther: Okay, we are gonna try to have the Order think we're continuing to work on the expedition, for everyone else here do we still feel like we need a real expedition? It's not like all these things with the raw Umbra, aren't still also happening. Do we try to run a dummy expedition or, or is it something as simple as I know a lot of you have been to Nod before, should we try to beat the Order to the punch and get there ahead of time?"
"Kingston: I don't know. If you ask me, that feels like a great goal. If you can stall them or hold them somehow but we, cause I mean, based on the experience with Dave, it feels like Gladiator and whatever this is are intimately tied."
[tense background music]
"Sofia: Yeah, I feel like, I feel like if, if you could maybe get in touch with the Order and say like, oh, we're gonna do a weekend retreat to strategize, you know."
Kingston: I like that. Y’all do a spa thing.
Ricky: Maybe we get an AirBNB upstate?
"Sofia: Act like the wizards really need a lot, like the wizarding side needs a lot more research and really play up how much research needs to go into this."
"Brennan: You see that she, she looks and says,"
"Esther: Okay, so that's it, I'm gonna contact—"
"Brennan: Oh, sorry yeah, go for it, Lou."
"Cody: Were you gonna say something, Kingston?"
"Kingston: Yeah, but it's, it's more, it's maybe a different, different topics so if anyone wants to speak on this, I'd encourage them to do so."
"Cody: I just wanted to say that like, that Tony dude was like, like figured out all of our shit. Even though we were like super fuckin stealthy about it. So like, are they gonna like fuck up the wizards while we're like in the nightmare realm?"
Kingston: That’s what I’m worried about.
"Cody: To like, is, are we just screwing people over?"
"Sofia: I think if I'm being, I mean, my instinct is that Tony, I just was sloppy and I don't think Tony would have figured nearly as much out if I had kept it together better."
Iga: There are ways for us to be sneakier than we have been. I have a spell that can disguise all of us.
"Ricky: Do you but, were you, Cody, were you saying like while we're gone are you worried about the wizards?"
"Cody: I was saying that like, they're gonna like fuck up, like, like this place, right because—"
"Brennan: Esther goes, Esther goes,"
"Esther: If they made an honest attempt at that, we have a lot of ways of defending ourselves. That said, that's not a terrible concern. Right now, we haven't responded to the Order. There they are acting like everything's hunky dory and that we are gonna be so dependent on their scrolls and their knowledge that we will keep working with them. I see no, I see a lot of utility in keeping them believing that, that we'll just keep working with them and not give them any, yeah."
"Sofia: Esther, can you make a dummy version of the scroll that Nadia gave me?"
Brennan: She looks over.
"Sofia: So that if they think it goes missing, that they think that you accidentally brought it."
"Brennan: She looks at the scrollin Pete's hands and says,"
"Esther: Vox Phantasma, do you mind if I do a little scan of that?"
"Pete: Not at all, yeah."
Ally: I hold it up for her.
Sofia: But make it wrong.
"Brennan: She smiles, pulls all the text off in runes, fabricates a new scroll with Conjuration, does a time spell to age the parchment several hundred years. Just like [magical sounds] put the things and says,"
"Esther: Okay, gibberish, nonsense, gobbledygook. Great, great, great. This will help nobody do anything."
(Siobhan laughs)
Sofia: This is a good option.
Zac: Is JJ here?
Brennan: JJ is not there.
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: But you can shoot him a text if you want to.
"Ricky: Well, I was just thinking, JJ is not a bad person to look at that hard drive if there's any more information on it. We should let him know that it might do some weird stuff."
Kingston: Yeah.
"Brennan: Esther looks at all of you, she says,"
"Esther: Cool. We're gonna hold the Order at arm's length. We're gonna feed them garbage and we're gonna keep them chasing a fool's errand. It's time for all of you to head to Nod, to figure out what's actually happening with this city. Got your back."
"Brennan: And that's all for this week on ""The Unsleeping City."" Tune in next week!"
All: [overlapping] Got your back.
"Lou: Damn, that was real."
Siobhan: It was so hard not to say it.
"Brennan: What was real, what was real?"
"Lou: That fucking courtroom scene, holy shit."
Zac: That was awesome.
Murph: That was so good.

[that classic Unsleeping City theme music we love so much]
"Brennan: Hello, one and all. Welcome back to another exciting episode of The Unsleeping City. I'm your humble dungeon master Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always, our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: [exaggerated fake running] Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Last we left off, our champions of New York City found themselves confronting the vastness of all of these threats facing the Unsleeping City and New York itself. Connected through a discovered hard drive in the offices of Excelsior Dynamic Homes, a company owned outright by Gladiator Industries. Taking these with Wally Claus, to Santa Claus's brother's house, a civil litigator and vampire named David Kugrich. We discovered that the horrifying force at work in the Sixth Borough, which our heroes have yet to venture into, is connected powerfully to Gladiator Industries. It seems that the poison in the waking world and the poison in the realms beyond are themselves one and the same. And as this was discovered, Kingston Brown, Vox Populi of New York City, declared out-and-out war on Gladiator."
Lou: [raises both fists and shakes them at the camera] They’ll fall.
"Brennan: Finally, proving that the mall goth was right the whole time, oh no."
Lou: This city is my mall. That was the truest thing Cody's ever said.
"Brennan: Pete also discovered that there did appear to be something in fact, medically going on with Nod in the dreaming. And that both Pete's physical presence, and the presence of someone who actually knew medicine, would both be appreciated by the monarch of the Sixth Borough. It also seems that Iga has actually confronted her ancestral matriarchs going into the past. And when asking, ""Why don't we go deeper into the castle?"" Or ask questions about it, figured out it was all based on a hunch from a woman who lived sometime in the '800s. Iga's great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great great, great grandma. These women obviously knew a lot about how to get warlock powers from a magical chest, but Iga also was the first in her matrilineal line to reach out to the power deep within the castle itself. Ricky learned some horrifying stuff from his new bud JJ, an apprentice wizard of the Gramercy Occult Society. And Sofia was confronted by the machinations of Tony Simos back at the Order of the Concrete Fist, and stepped down from her role as first fist in the monastery. Assembling at Esther and Ricky's apartment, our heroes have decided that the Gramercy Occult Society will engage in conning the newly rededicated Order under the partial leadership of Tony Simos as the new, or I should say, once again, First Fist of the monastery. And Esther is going to give them the runaround, having by on Sofia's behest created a fabricated version of the powerful scroll, Forms of the Greater Dreaming. The original copy of which is now in the hands of Pete Conlan, the Vox Phantasma. And the decision was basically, we know that something's going on in Nod, we know that the Gray Orphan needs Pete's help. We know that there is something out there in the deeper dreaming. And you also want to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Memories to talk about these Vox Phantasma memories that is also now weirdly connected with what's going on in the waking world's version of the Met, with the movement of the Cloisters stuff, which was shut down and bought by Gladiator, that has now all been moved to the Metropolitan Museum proper as it abuts Central Park. So, the plan has been made that Gramercy will give a runaround to Tony Simos to try to keep them off balance. But in the interim, all of you need to get prepared to head to Nod to see what's wrong before the Order catches wise. For all of you, this is in your hands. Esther is busy putting on a show for the Order. How much time do you want to take to set up this journey? Do you want to try to just head there as soon as you can? What's the game plan from all of you?"
"Ally: I would love an hour to run a quick errand and come back, but I can, yeah, that's my ideal..."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: I think Sofia has done all the research she can, 'cause she spent like two weeks with Gramercy working on this. So, I think all the research I could have possibly done, I've done."
"Brennan: Cool, hell yeah."
Zac: Ricky was just gonna reluctantly try to talk to Cody about his sword...
"Cody: Ah yes, the Thirsting Blade."
"Ricky: Yeah, the Thirsting Blade."
"Cody: Well, it hungers."
"Ricky: Sure, yeah, sure. I guess in a way it can hunger."
"Emily: ""Thirsting Blade hungers."" [laughs]"
Ally: That's why you named it the Thirsting Blade.
"Ricky: So, it hungers for, to drink."
Cody: For blood.
"Ricky: Yeah, okay."
"Emily: [laughing] That’s really funny, Murph."
"Ricky: Well, I was able to make… I just want to say that I was able to make this, my questing blade cast Suggestion, because I realized that could be helpful in certain scenarios for me. And, I dunno, I can maybe help you try to figure out how to imbue, get some sort of spell out of your weapon."
"Cody: Yeah, I mean, if… Yeah, I would definitely take you up on that, man. I appreciate it."
Ricky: Sick.
"Cody: So, you could help it get fangs, or maybe bleed on its own or something? Like if it had like serrated edges and shit?"
Ricky: Are you sure you want it just to be drinking blood?
"Cody: Yeah, I want it for it to be hungry."
"Ricky: Is there any, can I ask if just, maybe there's something a little more practical?"
Cody: Yeah. If it could use the darkness to protect the light.
Ricky: [nodding slowly] Okay.
Cody: 'Cause it's two sides of the same coin.
Ricky: Okay.
"Brennan: This conversation continues for a heart-wrenching amount of time. Cool. Pete's gonna take it… So, it looks like you guys are ready to head out truly post-haste."
"Lou: I check in with Iga and Cody real quick just about what we're asking them to do. And I'm just like, kind of I think like explain a little bit about Nod and what it's like to be there and how wild it is and just with kind of knowing all of that and how intense an experience it's gonna be,"
Kingston: Are you all ready for what could possibly be a more extended trip? Maybe more than a day or two as we go into whatever deeper dreaming may be?
"Iga: I'll be okay. I'll check in with my husband, make sure he's okay with my leaving for a couple of… I mean, he'll be okay with it. You know what I mean? But it's like polite to say. It's polite to ask, but if he says no that's a problem, you know?"
"Kingston: Yeah, yeah, I do know. I do know, I do know. Cody, are you good?"
"Cody: Yeah. I think dreams are kind of also nightmares, which are super goth. So, I think I'll be really good there. It's gonna be sick."
"Kingston: Yeah, it's gonna be sick. Sick. Sssssssssick, okay."
"Ricky: Do you think dreams and nightmares are two sides of the same coin, maybe?"
[Brennan laughing]
"Murph: I look, like— [makes a perplexed look at the ground for a moment]"
"Cody: Yeah, I do."
Ricky: Cool.
"Pete: You know, hunger and thirsting are kind of two sides of the same coin too."
Zac covers his face with his hands.
"Emily: Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. [laughs]"
Zac: Ricky finds his pull-up bar and just knocks a bunch out.
[laughing]
"Emily: I think while Pete runs his errand, Sofia goes into the bathroom and takes out what looks like a box of Sour Patch Kids, and stares at it for the entire hour."
[laughing]
"Iga: Sofia, are you okay in there?"
"Sofia: Yeah, I just—"
"Iga: Okay, 'cause I am a 45-year-old woman, and there's one bathroom in this apartment. You know what I mean?"
"Sofia: Okay, yeah, all right."
Emily: I guess it is just a box of Sour Patch Kids. I'll stare at it out in the open.
[laughing]
"Cody: Whoa, are you gonna eat those?"
"Sofia: Well, I'm saving them for later. I have low blood sugar."
Cody: All right.
"Murph: Yeah, I guess I will, with Ricky's help. I will speak to the Questing Blade. And, I think I'll, I guess I'll try to do the nicer one. I'll be like  "
"Cody: Thirsting Blade, I know that you hunger, but I want to use the darkness to protect the light."
"Thirsting Blade: [deep voice] Hah, master. You wish to use the darkness to protect the light, for indeed they are two sides of the same coin."
Cody: Finally. You understand.
Zac: Do I hear this?
[Murph laughing]
"Brennan: I think you do, Ricky. I think you do hear it, yeah."
"Zac: Can you tell the Questing Blade I said hey, just to..."
Cody: Ricky says hi.
Thirsting Blade: Who? Who says hi?
"Ricky sighs loudly and squeezes his eyes shut, looking down."
"Cody: Did you hear that, Ricky? It was, like, confused."
"Ricky: It's okay, I don't know if you can just keep--"
"Sofia: To be fair, it spent like three years with Dale."
"Ricky: Yeah, yeah."
"Sofia: I mean, he's a real presence."
"Ricky: Okay, nevermind. Yeah, just I'll just keep helping you as much as I can."
Sofia: He might have reformat… Maybe Dale reformatted the Questing Blade.
"Thirsting Blade: My previous master Dale made me into nunchucks. So, that was, you know I could do something like that."
Ricky: So you remember Dale? You remember Dale?
[Emily laughing]
Thirsting Blade: [passive-aggressively] Is someone talking right now? Is someone talking right now?
"Ricky: I'm talking. My name’s Ricky. I used to, [stammers] you used to, I used to have an axe that was you."
"Thirsting Blade: Oh, weird. I don't remember being an axe. I just remember just being given away, and no one even saying goodbye. So, that's what I remember."
[Emily laughing]
Lou snaps sassily.
"Cody: My sword is fucking pissed at you, dude."
"Ricky: I never, I... wow, okay."
"Thirsting Blade: No, but it's fine. It is what it is, you know? As the monks so often say, Anyway, yeah, ""Thirsting Blade,"" cool. ""Use the darkness to defend the light."" Do you want me to spray blood or shoot poison or venom?"
"Cody: Thirsting Blade, yeah, am I a fucking rebound to you, dude?"
Thirsting Blade: What?
Brennan gets very close to the camera.
"Thirsting Blade: Whoa, whoa, Cody, you are not a rebound, no way."
"Cody: ‘Cause, I know you fuckin’, like, it just seems like you're not that fucking hungry for blood even though you're the thirsting blade."
"Thirsting Blade: I'm super hungry for blood. Cody, oh my God! Wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, listen."
"Cody: Okay, yeah, 'cause I'm just saying, you seemed freaking pissed and when people are, y’know, a lot of emotion there."
Ricky: Could you tell the Questing Blade that I--
"Cody: It's actually the Thirsting Blade, Rick."
Ricky: Okay.
Ally: “Rick!”
[cast laughing]
Ally: All of a sudden the CW logo appears on the corner of our screen.
[cast laughing]
"Ricky: Yeah, all right. I'll give the Questing Blade a little time, but I am very sorry. I didn't, yeah, I'm very sorry."
Cody: No— Are you saying sorry to me or sorry to the sword?
Ricky: The sword.
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: You guys, so, you're getting ready. Everyone else is getting ready to head out to Nod. Pete, what was your errand that you wanted to run real quick?"
"Ally: Okay, I would love to hit up 53\/3N."
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: And then, I guess I check in really quick. I'm going for a couple of different reasons, but Kingston or whoever has the hard drive, maybe I'll see."
"Pete: Do you guys want my friend to look at this, or do we feel really solid about JJ? Not to distrust JJ, just wasn't sure if he, you know, maybe—"
Sofia: I was gonna—
Ricky: The weird hacker drug dealer would maybe be better?
"Pete: Honestly, yeah. He's pretty bulletproof."
"Kingston: Hey, I mean, I want this company dead more than anything in the world right now. So if there's any edge your truly horrible friend could give us, I'd take it."
"Pete: He’s horr— He has no social cues and he has no empathy, but he's extremely good at what he does. And he's set up a perfect life to where empathy is not that important. So, and that's fine for him. Honestly, living his ideal life, his à la carte life, you know?"
Kingston: Yeah.
"Ally: Anyway, should I take that and can I hit up 53\/3N and be like,"
"Pete: Hey, man. It's been a second, but I actually really need your help with something."
"Brennan: You see, you get a text back immediately being like,"
53\/3N: How long have you had this phone? And who knows this number?
"Ally: Oh, oh, oh, oh great. I tell him,"
Pete: I'll throw the chip in the microwave on my way to see you.
"Brennan: Copy. You see, he says,"
53\/3N: I can help you out. Are you looking to re-up? Been a while.
"Pete: Not that, it's a couple other of your services, ;)"
Ally: [laughing] And then I immediately regret sending a bro winky face.
"Brennan: You see, he says,"
"53\/3N: Okay, if you're not working for me, you're gonna have to pay like everybody else."
"Pete: Yeah, I get it. No worries."
"Brennan: Rad. Yeah. He says,"
53\/3N: Done and done.
"Ally: Okay, great. I take the SIM card out of my cell phone and just truly ruin Ricky's microwave. I say,"
Pete: I'm so sorry!
"Ally: I put two minutes on the microwave. The chip explodes, your microwave is ruined. And then I say,"
Pete: Who has cash? 'Cause I'm gonna need--
"Ricky: Hey Pete, what are you doing?"
Pete: Listen.
"Iga: I have cash, what do you need? I have cash, what do you need?"
Pete: I just need a couple thousand. I will pay you back eventually.
Iga: Okay. Is it for this stuff?
"Ally: Okay, I take an Uber to see 53\/3N. [laughs]"
"Brennan: Iga, do you want to hook Pete up?"
[long pause]
[Ally laughs]
Siobhan: Yeah. I guess I'll ask everybody like is this a thing that we want to do?
Sofia: I think it's not a bad idea.
Kingston: Yeah.
"Iga: Okay. Technically Sofia, this your money anyway. So, let's go with it."
[laughing]
"Ally: I tell Iga, I'm like,"
"Pete: Iga, I know so many freshmen and sophomores at Columbia College who would die for a reading from you. So I will—"
"Iga: Yeah, just recommend them to me. Send them my way."
Pete: I will.
Sofia: I've also given you a Yelp review every single time I've gone to you.
"Iga: Yes, and I gave you that $15 discount every single time."
[Emily laughing]
"Ally: 15 off of like, 250 or whatever!"
"Iga: Okay, look, I'll give you a discount—"
"Sofia: My most recent one said, “She pulled the tower card and showed me I was falling off a tower, and I lost my job like, the next day.”"
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: Pete, are you heading to go give that to 53\/3N right now?"
[tense music]
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. You swing by 53\/3N's place. You walk in, huge refrigerated warehouse, no visible furniture, giant cooling units hitting servers. He's just at a giant multi-screen PC, gold-plated AK-47 next to him."
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: You see there's a huge bunch of just like plastic-wrapped, some kind of intense drug substance next to him. There is a small dog wearing a sweater and shoes nearby, 'cause it's so fucking"
"freezing cold in here. He turns around and goes,"
"53\/3N: Pete, my man. Good to see you. So, again, no chance of re-upping?"
"Pete: No, not at all. But here, I brought your favorite trash foods."
Ally: And I give him like nacho cheese Cheetos and like purple Skittles and like cotton candy soda.
"53\/3N: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. This is what I like."
"Pete: Okay, man, I got three things I need your help with and you can tell me what your price is."
"Ally: But, one, I think I… Can I give him the scroll and have him put it in whatever insane vault shit like high, high safety."
"Brennan: He says,"
53\/3N: You You want me to fucking vanish this thing?
Pete: This is stolen art that I need not to be able to be found.
"Ally: And I think before that, I just read it all. I tried to absorb it but—"
"Brennan: Cool. He says,"
"53\/3N: Done, it's gone."
"Pete: Okay. Then I need you to find out everything you can about a Calvin Thomas? Just need a background check, or if you know any PIs or something, honestly, I guess I could hire them. But, you're pretty good at that."
"Brennan: You see, uh—"
The other cast members start to laugh as they realize what Pete just asked.
Siobhan: I just gave you 2000 dollars to research your ex’s new boyfriend.
"Ally: It's just really important. So sorry guys, I did have to dip out for an hour."
Brennan: [crosstalk] He nods—
"Ally: [crosstalk] You see, it’s— No, there might be something more there! Actually. Yeah."
Emily: I weirdly am ready for—
"Ally: How strong is— what does he bench? Like, that's what I'm trying to find out."
"Brennan: You mentioned Calvin Thomas. He says,"
53\/3N: What's your third thing?
Ally: Can I do an Insight check on what his reaction is to Calvin Thomas?
"Brennan: Sure, give me an insight check."
Ally: [raises their eyebrows] 8.
Brennan: You got no idea.
"Ally: He's hard to read. All right, cool. And then the third thing is, I give him the hard drive and I say,"
"Pete: This thing is really fucked up, but there's something going on with Gladiator. I don't know if you’ve been notice—"
"53\/3N: [looks sharply up and points aggressively] Fuck Gladiator, dude, fuck Gladiator."
"Pete: Thank you man, ex-fucking-xactly."
"53\/3N: State collaborators, panopticon motherfuckers. I fucking hate them."
Pete: Exactly. This might be able to bring them down. This thing goes deep.
"Ally: And then I explain as much of this web as I know about, and then I ask him if he can really go into these drives, but a lot of them are extremely protected and they completely ruined a computer or whatever."
"Brennan: He nods. He says,"
"53\/3N: Fuck 'em. Hey Pete, I'm gonna charge you."
"Brennan: He looks and says,"
"53\/3N: For disappearing this,"
"Brennan: He says,"
"53\/3N: It's gonna be four and a half K. The Gladiator shit, I do for free. Thank you for the fucking lead, dude."
Pete: You're welcome.
"Brennan: You see, he says as he says that by the way, you hear a reverberation of what Kingston yelled in Queens the other day. [echoing roar] It is echoing. Kingston's declaration is echoing throughout people, who even when they are fucking extremely unpleasant like 53\/3N is, are proud New Yorkers. You see that 53\/3N looks at you and goes,"
"53\/3N: Hell yeah. You're not fucking drinking Cypher, are you, right?"
"Pete: No dude, no. Wait, are you? I know you—"
"53\/3N: Dude, if you are not makin your own fucking nutrient sludge, you are a stooge."
"Brennan: And he points to giant crates. He's like,"
"53\/3N: Proteins, fats, amino acids. Food is a lie to get you to consume from retail outlets. You boil food down to its barest essentials, I make my own food now. I have thousands of pounds of various powders that make up what a human needs to survive. I have boiled my eating time down to eight and a half minutes a day. I sleep three hours a day, super productive."
Pete: That’s sick.
"53\/3N: I'm getting only REM. Cypher, that bullshit, it knocks you out of your REM cycle. You can't dream while you're drinking it."
"Pete: Wait, how do you know that?"
"53\/3N: Dude, you gotta be reading the zines I send you. I'm sending you these zines all the time— You don’t have my shit blocked, do you?"
"Pete: I got all the zines. I just didn't have time to read a zine. Sometimes you look and it's just a picture of an open vagina and you're like, I don't need to read the rest of this."
"53\/3N: [pointing to his temple] Yeah, it's a metaphor, Peter."
[cast laughing]
"Pete: All right, cool. It's a fucking cool zine. I'm sorry, I'll read it next time."
53\/3N: There's nothing wrong with a vagina. We all—
"Pete: Duh, dude, duh. Fucking duh, do you know me?"
"53\/3N: I know you, dude. That's what I'm saying. It's like that when I see a zine with a vagina on it, I go, great, serious literature. I'm gonna learn something."
Pete: Good.
"Brennan: You see that he, he looks at you and says,"
"53\/3N: Yeah, don't drink that Cypher garbage."
"Brennan: He says,"
53\/3N: I can make you a nutrient sludge. You want me to make you a batch?
"Pete: Yyyyyeah, for sure, man. I would love to try that actually."
"Brennan: He looks at you and says,"
"53\/3N: Rad. Just, as for the Calvin Thomas thing? I'm gonna be diving into this Gladiator shit. That's gonna be my main focus."
Pete: Okay.
"Brennan: He thinks for a second and says,"
"53\/3N: I can put up, I can farm this out to someone, or I could put you in touch with her... It would be weird for me to put— I think it might be weird for me to put you in touch with her though, because she's been looking for you, and I put her off your trail specifically. But, she's the best at what she does."
"Pete: Wait, what?"
"Brennan: He says,"
53\/3N: She specifically finds people. She's a dirt-digger. She's like an internet PI.
Pete: Yeah?
"53\/3N: She reached out specifically, but she knew that you were working for me, but she hasn't known recently. But I can put you in touch with her if you want."
"Pete: No. Wait, was she fucking hired?"
"Ally: And then I name some of the names that we have now from like, you know, I mean, obviously like Tony."
"53\/3N: No no, no, no. She wanted to apologize, but I don't fucking rat people out."
"[tense, slightly discordant music]"
"Brennan: You see, he looks at you and says,"
53\/3N: She was the one who found you working for your family.
Pete’s eyes widen.
53\/3N: This is like years ago. But I didn't mention it to you because—
Pete: Like when my dad found me?
"53\/3N: [nodding] Yeah. She was working for them. She fucked up and wanted to basically return the money. She said, ""Can you put me… She knew where you lived, but didn't want to broach it that way, because you stopped living at that place in Greenpoint and she couldn't find you anymore. And so she reached out to me, and I was basically like, I don't fucking rat people. I'm not even gonna mention this to Pete. I won't even mention it to Pete for three years. And that's where we are right now."
"Pete: Dude, I love that. All right, so the thing is I brought $2,000. I can move some stuff for you for the rest of it."
53\/3N: Great.
Pete: Okay.
"Brennan: You see, he puts some bricks in front of you."
"Ally: [putting their face in their hand] Okay, I put them in my bag."
[Lou laughs quietly and also covers his face]
Brennan: Put them in your bag.
Ally: So much money.
"Brennan: You see, he looks and says,"
53\/3N: Do you want me to put this woman in touch with you? She really is the best.
"Pete: Yeah... I'll deal with that later. But, you can put her in touch with my third bumper Gmail."
"53\/3N: Cool, you got it."
"Pete: Okay. Great. All right, well, good to see you, man."
"53\/3N: Hey, good to see you too. We're gonna fuck these fucks."
"Pete: Yeah, we are."
53\/3N: All right.
"Brennan: Cool. Pete, you head out."
Emily: Can I
Ally: I try to sell my Uber driver all of the drugs?
[cast laughing]
Brennan: Give me a Persuasion check.
"Ally: Okay, okay, that's actually pretty high. That is a 22."
"Brennan: Oh, yeah, he'll buy $20 off of you."
"Ally: God, no, I'm talking about like $2,500. [laughs] All right, I sell him a little bit. We'll just fucking will eat away at this. Fuckin’ damn it."
Brennan: Pete!
"Ally: Can I stop by a corner store and buy a scratcher? And if I hit a Nat 20, I won $2,500? [laughs]"
"Brennan: Hey Ally, yes, we can do that. If you hit the Nat 20 right now, you hit a scratcher."
"Ally: 17! All right, all right, all right. We'll figure this out as we go."
"Siobhan: Oh, you won another ticket."
"Brennan: Yeah. So, now you have 15 new dollars."
[Ally laughs]
"Brennan: Cool. You have those bricks. You head out having given the hard drive and the stuff to 53\/3N. 53\/3N has put you in touch with this, apparently, person who wanted to reach out to you to apologize for having tracked you down. And you can't think about that right now. You're about to head to Nod. You have a bag full of drugs. The hard drive is in 53\/3N’s hands, he’s on it. And Forms of the Greater Dreaming is being disappeared. Everybody else, Esther basically says that she needs to be available. She talks to you, Ricky, about JJ and goes,"
"Esther: I don't think it would be bad to get JJ out of the city, especially if Tony has been really aggressive to him. If you want to bring him to have a wizard from the Society with you, I think that could be a good idea. He has been studying the maps of Nod. He knows it like the back of his hand. He's really been focusing on it."
"Ricky: Okay, yeah. I wasn't sure if he was… It's a big thing, so I wasn't sure if he was ready. So it's like, if he feels ready, then let's take him."
"Brennan: She shrugs and says,"
"Esther: You know, he's as ready as you were when you started."
"Ricky: [nodding] For sure, for sure."
Esther: Just keep an eye on him.
Ricky: Cool.
"Brennan: Cool. You guys get to the L train platform to take the L to the end of the line, baby. It's the six of you. I assume Ox is there as well, Misiek, Luna. JJ rolls up, T-shirt, sneakers. Got his laptop tapped into a battery pack in his back pocket. He looks over at you, Ricky, and is like,"
"JJ: What's up, man?"
Ricky smiles and gives him two thumbs up.
"JJ: Excited. I know it was only a couple of weeks ago, this is not the Holland Tunnel. I'm ready to throw down. I hope I don't slow y'all down. And I hear that one of the places that we want to swing by is the Met. So, I have a little spell I concocted myself,"
"Brennan: [booping noise] And you see that he pulls up a little like 2D portal, like eight-bit kind of image thing that is big enough for him to slip a hand through. And you see he's like,"
"JJ: So hopefully, while the Vox Phantasma is doing his thing, I'll be able to sneak through from another dimension and straight up snag all of that Native art while the museum's closed. So, rock and roll, hell yeah."
Ricky: That sounds awesome.
"Brennan: You see, he's like,"
"JJ: Hell yeah, I might—"
Iga: Can I have one of those? Can I get one of those?
"Brennan: He says,"
"JJ: Yeah, let me, and if I can just grab your dimensions real quick and I can try to make one."
"Brennan: And he starts to show you how to do the cantrip, which is like a little dimensional. It's like, if you're in one dimension, you can just shove your hand into the mirror of that place in another dimension. You guys take the L all the way into Nod. [train chugging] You arrive. It is the last few days of November. And you see that there is beginning to be snow kicking up from Nod. As it was when you took the L train all the way here the last time with Pete cradling Nod in his arms and walked to the Poseidon Diner. You guys walk out of the train into the Sixth Borough. Lots of lights are out. You look around. This place is flooded with raw Umbra. The feeling you get walking through Nod this time is not one of being in immediate danger. Not the feeling of a predator breathing down the back of your neck. The feeling instead is that of being in a forest in which there is something so dangerous out there that everything else has left. It is a new moon in Nod, and the woman in the moon is not even showing her face. There are stars in the sky still, but you do not see gleeful dream creatures bounding through the sky, nor do you see shooting stars. The stars are still twinkling, but no comets sail past. The place that has gone quiet with the awareness that something is out there in the distance. You make your way to the Metropolitan Museum of Dreams. As you arrive, JJ speaks up and says,"
"JJ: Okay, well, whole other dimension, oh my god. [laughs] The Dreaming. [laughs] What? Okay."
Ally: I put my arm around JJ.
"Brennan: He immediately says,"
"JJ: Ooh, it feels better. Okay, yeah. Hey, we're here with the Vox Phantasma, right? What's gonna happen? We got the Vox here. We're good, we're good."
"Brennan: Kingston, you have your little Metro card that gives you access to this place. And as you walk through, the mist no longer retreats from you. You walk through the mist."
"Lou: Okay. Honestly, I don't try and full fly, but can I float now?"
Brennan: Kingston has done a lot of work on his heart over the past three years. What's something that is not true in Kingston's waking life that is like a dream or some fantasy that would fill Kingston's heart with light and levity and joy?
"Lou: Oh, oh, what is it? [thinks for a second] Why is this hard? I think 'cause the first thing I thought of was children, like immediately it's kids."
"Brennan: That's okay. That's okay. Yeah, I think Kingston… There's obviously sadness there as well, but there's also, the thought of it does bring you joy. You think of what a child that would look like, your and Liz's child would look like in your arms, and you lift up from the ground and kick your legs out a little bit as you—"
"Kingston: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, all right."
Lou: And then I immediately try and come down.
[Emily laughs]
Brennan imitates a thudding landing.
"Kingston: Cool, cool. Okay, things are different this time. Okay, all right."
"Brennan: Hey, Pete telling people to stop smoking at a hospital, if the Vox Phantasma is saying, ""Follow the rules,"" the Vox Populi can certainly float a little bit in the dream realm. We're in a healthier New York, gang. Yeah, I think Kingston holds onto that dream for a moment. And the fact that it's a dream, doesn't mean it's not beautiful. And that's enough to lift you off your feet."
"Cody: So, can we all fly now, or?"
Murph: Cody just jumps.
"Brennan: [makes a boinging noise] You sort of jump a little bit. JJ speaks up and says,"
"JJ: Okay, so the Metropolitan Museum of Memories has a very complex layout and structure. There's a lot more inside than the normal Met. But if what you guys are worried about is that unicorn spirit, that got moved into a wing I think near Arms and Armor, which is like the old medieval stuff. I don't know how dream world expedition works. Should we split up? Is there something that you all want to do?"
Iga: No.
"Pete: Never split up, not in Nod."
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: You see JJ kinda goes,"
"JJ: Cool, okay. Good to know. I'll make sure to keep my bearings around me."
"Brennan: Awesome. You guys begin to head further in. Pete, you can tell something has entered this place. Something's not right here. It's also dark here."
Ally: Do I get a sense of where Nod is? Am I able to kind of intuitively know where they are?
"Brennan: Yes, I think so. You know that Nod is way probably way up on their cloud in Brooklyn. You guys, I think, swung by here first, because you were worried about this unicorn thing."
"Ally: For sure, okay."
Siobhan: Can I use Misiek to do a Perception check?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
Siobhan: 'Cause Misiek is good at perceiving things that you can't necessarily see. Dirty 20.
"Brennan: Misiek flies out. Everyone here, give me a little Insight check."
Emily: 13.
"Siobhan: Oh, I rolled a Nat 20."
Ally: Yessss.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: 17.
"Brennan: Iga, you call to Misiek. Misiek looks up and goes up onto your shoulder and licks your face a bunch. And you see Misiek's eyes go wide. As a little bit of this new power flows through you, Misiek looks a little bit less sick. And I think for anyone else here who rolled a 15 or above, part of you might, maybe wonders like, ""Where did Iga get this little dragon thing? These are not native to New York."" I mean, there's weird shit all the time. But I guess no one is like, ""What is this little guy?"" Misiek [growls] flies off and Iga, you see just in the dark, flashes its little like reflective animal eyes over at you, and slinks over and looks into the Arms and Armor exhibit and growls and taps for immediate danger."
Emily: I cast Jump on myself.
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm gonna cast Freedom of Movement on myself."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Can I use Divine Sense?
Brennan: You cast Divine Sense. You detect a powerful celestial presence in the next room that is dying.
"Siobhan: Ooh, shit."
"Emily: Uhhh, okay, I think I'm just gonna run towards it."
"Murph: Yeah, let’s go."
"Brennan: Cool, you guys sprint—"
"Emily: Sorry, I don't think that I would be logical in this situation."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You guys feel the danger. Ricky, you sense something is hurting in there. All of you sprint. You come through the doors, darkness everywhere. Looming in the faded light... All of you can look through the doors and see a beautiful unicorn chained to the ground covered in blood. This is the Unicorn of New York City, one of Kugrash's totems. And there are four animated suits of armor on Barding, hovering ghostly over it, stabbing it to death with their lances."
Lou: Ohh!
Emily: Okay.
Ally: Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: As PCs, you guys are only gonna be able to see what is actually visible to you. [the Roll20 map is partially covered in blackness] The rest, if it's behind the wall or through a door you haven't gone through, will be represented in darkness. I, however as the DM, am able to see the whole map. Everybody roll initiative. A 22 from Sofia. Iga?"
Iga: 12.
Brennan: Cody?
Murph: 4.
Brennan: Pete?
Ally: 18.
Brennan: Ricky?
Zac: 13.
Brennan: Kingston?
Lou: 17.
"Brennan: 17, hell yeah. Here we go."
"Lou: Vroom, vroom."
"Brennan: Vroom, vroom, baby."
"Ally: We've had a long rest, right?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Ally: Since the last, yeah, okay."
"Zac: Oh, whoops, my health is probably a little lower too."
"Brennan: You guys hear smashing coming from the side chambers off of the main place, but see those knights preparing to, like, do in the unicorn. But you also do hear other things. The hall is bigger. There are side galleries and other things like that around. First to act is Sofia Lee."
"Emily: All right, I'm just gonna… This is bathed in shadow, right?"
Brennan: Yep.
Emily: I'm just gonna Shadow Step to right over one of those knights. I'll go for the top right one. And I'm going to just attack.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: I roll with advantage, and I absolutely fucking missed on my first attack."
Brennan: How far is Shadow Step by the way?
Emily: 60 feet.
Brennan: Cool. Yep yep yep.
"Emily: And, but my second attack, I got a 23."
Brennan: 23 is going to hit.
"Emily: Okay, so, [seeing her die] ooh, I do 13 with my right hook and then… Oh, and I used my bonus action. So yeah, that's all I do."
Brennan: How much do you do with that attack?
Emily: Just 13 damage.
Brennan: Give me an immediate either Insight or Arcana check.
"Emily: Oh no. I got a 19 plus 3 for Insight, so 22."
"Brennan: Your fist goes [swooshes]. You can tell that you've done some damage here. You beat a 20, right?"
"Emily: I beat a 20 on my Insight? Yeah, I got 22."
"Brennan: Your monk training kicks in. This is some dream magic. You specifically think it's some time magic. You're looking at these things and when you hit it, you feel your fist shake in a way that you did on New Year's Eve when the time stone went off and you were trapped in a single moment. You feel that this armor is partially protected by its historicity. That there is literally something about the fact that your fist is from the present and this thing is from the past, that means it has resistance to what you just did to it."
"Emily: So, it means it wants history. History will hurt it."
"Brennan: History will hurt it, exactly."
"Siobhan: Well, we're in a room full of weapons."
[laughing]
Emily: I will throw in a Stunning Strike just in case. I don't think it's...
Brennan: Cool. You spend the ki point and learn that these things are immune to stun.
"Emily: Okay, I had a feeling that might happen. [laughs]"
Siobhan: Worth a try.
Emily: You have to try it once to find out that it won't work.
"Brennan: That's Sofia's turn. Next is… this… Ah-buh-buh-buh… You see, silently the unicorn reaches out and does one of the only things it can do, which is cast Pass Without Trace on Sofia. Looking up from a blood-soaked face, it goes,"
"Unicorn: [Southern accent] Oh hey there, sugar. You look great."
Brennan: And shadows swirl around you.
"Sofia: Thank you so much. You know what? We're gonna get you out of here, okay?"
"Unicorn: Oh, thanks. Oh God, I'm in so much pain."
"Sofia: No, we're getting you out of here."
Brennan: Hold on one second.
Ally: [laughs] I forgot about the Unicorn's voice.
"Brennan: [laughing] The Unicorn, that's what the Unicorn sounds like."
Ally: [imitating the Unicorn] What are you doing here?
[laughing]
Zac: When did we meet the unicorn again?
Brennan: Pete—
"Ally: I think in my first drug trip, like—"
Zac: Oh.
"Brennan: Into Nod, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on. Okay. Pete, that's gonna be you."
Ally: Okay. I run forward to here. 30 feet. Hell yeah. And then I am going to cast Banishment on the unicorn.
Emily: Ooh.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: And then, ooh, I'm actually, yeah, I'm gonna use a sorcery point to make that a bonus action. So, it'll be a Quicken Spell, or two sorcery points. And then, I'm gonna use my action to hide."
"Brennan: Ah, hell yeah. Go ahead and make a Stealth check for me."
Ally: That is a 19.
"Brennan: A 19, awesome. A 19, damn. Pete, you jump into the shadows and hide. That is going to be… The Unicorn vanishes. Pete, you fold the unicorn into pure Dreaming where these mounted Plate and Bardings cannot reach it. And after Pete, that goes to be Kingston Brown."
"Lou: Okay, so first I need to move myself, because I just can't see. I can't see anything."
"Ally: Oh, I guess I yell,"
Pete: There are people in the other rooms!
"Ally: 'Cause from where I'm standing, I can see at least some sort of token."
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: I'll come stand next to Pete. And the Unicorn is like the one, is like the thing, like that's the celestial that we sensed needed help. And it's now safe."
Brennan: That is correct.
"Lou: Okay, great. Let's try something crazy then. I'd like to cast Summon Celestial Spirit."
Brennan: Ooh!
Lou: And call forth a spirit from the Upper Planes.
"Brennan: [rubbing his hands together] Hell yes. Okay, hold on one second. Um.. Yeah, we're gonna do this. Cool. You reach out to call a spirit from the Upper Planes. You are in Nod. This has never been more appropriate. You rush in, call... Summon Celestial. I'm gonna go ahead and get that little thing for myself. Go ahead and roll initiative for this celestial if you’d be so kind, and let me know what you roll."
Lou: Great.
"Emily: Did you write down your guess, Zac?"
Zac: I did. It's like—
Emily: I wrote down my guess too.
Lou: Their initiative will be 16.
"Brennan: 16 you say, okay."
"Zac: Yours is 17, right?"
Brennan: Yes.
Lou: Mine is 17.
Murph: Wow.
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Lou: This is wild. Damn, look at me out here summoning shit, let's go. Let's go, this thing’s got a fly speed."
"Emily: It's gonna be history too, I think."
Lou: I hope.
Ally: Oof!
"Brennan: What's this called again, sorry? It's called a celestial spirit."
"Lou: Yes, it's Summon Celestial Spirit. I just did all the math in terms of, like, its AC and it's HP."
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: And I'm gonna summon a Defender Celestial.
"Brennan: Kingston, you reach out and summon [magical boom] celestial spirit. Light reaches into the Met all the way from JFK in the distance. [heavenly chiming] Alejandro Ortiz appears next to you."
[cast gasping]
"Emily: Oh, I was wrong. I guessed Kugrash. [holding a piece of paper up to the camera; it does say “Kugrash” but it immediately vanishes into the background]"
"Brennan: Oh, Kugrash!"
"Lou: Oh, that would have been crazy."
Zac: [holding up his guess] Stephen Sondheim.
"Brennan: Stephen Sondheim, incredible."
"Emily: I did think Alejandro, but I couldn't remember his name."
Brennan: So you see Alejandro Ortiz.
"Alejandro: Oh, my friend Kingston Brown, it's good to see you again."
"Kingston: Alejandro, so good to see you. I'm not gonna lie, I've never done that before. Did not know it would be you. How you feel about kicking some ass right now?"
"Brennan: He says,"
"Alejandro: Honestly, I love paradise. My wife, she is so beautiful. But to lay the smack down one last time with my good friend, it would be an honor."
Kingston: Let's get it.
"Brennan: Yeah, you call on your authority for the importance of this mission to New York City. Because you are in Nod, Alejandro is able to appear. He's in the dreaming. It's contingent to paradise."
"Lou: So, is he gonna have Alejandro stats, or is he gonna have these… 'Cause this whole thing, it's like a melee fight."
Brennan: Alejandro is about to take his cane and lay into this like an angel wizard. He's about to fully go for it.
"Lou: As Alejandro takes his turn, can I yell at Alejandro,"
"Kingston: Hey, the cane's not gonna cut it. You're gonna have to use maybe some of the weaponry in here."
"Alejandro: Oh, something from the historical period attached to the… Okay, yeah!"
Kingston: Yeah.
Alejandro: I can do that.
Brennan: Amazing. He's gonna go right after you.
"Lou: Great. I think that's, I'll, that'll be the end of my, that's everything… I don't have any bonus actions I'm gonna do at this time. So, that's the end of my turn."
"Brennan: Hell yes. Incredible. Alejandro is going to, yeah, he's got a fly speed of 40 feet. The first thing he's going to do, and he's Defender, right?"
Lou: Yes.
Brennan: Okay. Go ahead if you would be so kind. He makes a number of attacks equal to half the spell's level rounded down?
"Lou: So, he'll make two."
"Brennan: He'll make two attacks, okay."
"Ally: Wow, cool."
"Brennan: Amazing. He'll make two attacks. He moves over here. He's first gonna make a History check. It's a DC 20 History check, but he's got a plus eight to History. [the roll is a 12] He hits it exactly. Alejandro looks over and says,"
"Alejandro: Okay, around late 13th century, so that's pretty much within the wheelhouse of what we can expect, something like this."
"Brennan: He reaches out, grabs a mace from one of the things and in a flash of celestial light leaps forward. Go ahead and give me two attack rolls for him."
"Lou: Hell yes. That first one's gonna be a, I don't think it'll hit. Yeah, won’t hit. That second one... Also, two 3’s in a row. Alejandro does not make contact."
Brennan: He's having a great time.
[Zac laughs]
"Kingston: Alejandro, stop having fun."
"Alejandro: No, this is so fun. You have no idea. I was in paradise. I was with my wife, beautiful sunset as always. And then a thing comes up and an angel says, ""Hey, the Vox Populi of New York City is in Nod, and has actually asked for us to send..."" And I was like, ""I will be so happy to do this.” So, this is incredible, man. You look so great. [fanboying] You and Liz! Oh my God! My friend—"
"Kingston: Alejandro, focus!"
"Alejandro: Okay, focus up. I hit the armor, yes, yes, yes."
"Brennan: Incredible. That is Alejandro's turn. Now it is going to be the Plate and Barding, oh no. Okay. Sofia, you can get a swing on one of these suits as they both advance away from you."
"Lou: Oh, I don’t like that."
"Emily: Oh, okay. I mean, hmm. Is there any way I can, as I swing, wrap some of their, uh, wrap some of their clothing around my fist to make historical fistwraps?"
"Brennan: Make a Sleight of Hand check. DC 20, Sleight of Hand."
"Emily: Okay. It's gonna be a 12, so I don't. [laughs] And I'm gonna just try to attack. I get a 21 to attack."
"Brennan: 21 hits, go ahead and roll damage."
Emily: That's 10.
"Brennan: Hell yes. You strike it again feeling that move away from it. The unicorn is safe. However, these two back up and are both going to charge Sofia."
"Emily: Oh, you had me use my reaction so I can't use Shield!"
"Brennan laughs evilly, sticking his tongue out."
"Emily: That's really good stuff, and you deserve to hit me."
[cast laughing]
Brennan: Incredible. Both of them are going to rush past you.
"Emily: Wow, that's really good stuff."
"[quiet, dreamlike background music]"
"Brennan: That's that good stuff. That's the stuff we like, you know? Okay. Both of them are going to rush past boom, boom. And that's going to, they're gonna make some attacks now. That's a hit for sure. [the background music crescendos into something faster and more drum-heavy] And, we'll go again. Those are two more hits."
Lou: Boo! Boo!
Brennan looks down below camera and causes a loud rattling.
Zac: Oh my God. You hear that amount of dice?
Ally: Jesus!
Lou: I hate that.
"Emily: [crosstalk] I don’t know, I guess he wants me to do extra radiant damage."
"Lou: [crosstalk] They do chaos damage, that means we're gonna have a problem."
"Brennan: I hear you, I do hear you. Let me go ahead and get a strength saving throw from Sofia, if you'd be so kind."
[dramatic music]
"Emily: [impressed laughter] Oh, that's gonna be, okay, that's gonna be a 25."
"Brennan: Okay, you are not knocked prone, which is good. However, that's gonna be... one, two, three, four, five, six, [rummages around behind himself] need more dice."
Lou: Boo! Boo!
[Emily laughs]
"Siobhan: No, fewer dice, fewer."
Lou: Shame. Can I shame you into using fewer dice?
Emily: I can’t get over this fucking con.
"Brennan: I’m just gonna do this in Roll20, 'cause this is..."
Lou: Don't do this.
Siobhan: Down with this sort of thing.
Lou: I thought we shamed you enough to stop this kind of behavior.
Emily: [laughing] I feel so delightfully conned for taking that opportunity attack.
[cast laughing]
Ally and Lou: Delightfully conned.
Emily: This is like when Madam Anastasia reads my tarot.
Brennan: Sofia takes 55 points of damage.
Lou: Hachi machi!
"Emily: I look up as blood trickles from my nose and say,"
Sofia: The thing is you don't realize you just made me stronger.
[Brennan laughing]
Ally: Absolute freak!
Brennan: Okay. This one is going to rush past... Okay. This one's going to barrel past Kingston to get an attack on Kingston.
Zac: Barrel past who? Sorry?
Brennan: Attack of opportunity from Alejandro.
Lou: Okay.
Zac: He’s barreling past Kingston to attack Ricky?
Brennan: He's gonna get an attack on both of you.
Lou: Does a 13 hit?
"Brennan: Does a 13 hit? No, a 13 does not hit."
Lou: Hey-achi.
"Kingston: Alejandro, focus up!"
"Alejandro: It's hard, it’s so much fun to be fighting again. I missed you guys so much. Sofia, oh my God. Ricky, hello."
[laughing]
"Brennan: He says,"
"Alejandro: When you live in paradise, the stakes are very low."
Sofia: So it's boring there?
"Alejandro: No, it's great. But it's like, what's gonna happen? They're gonna kill me and I'm gonna go back to be with my wife forever? It’s fine!"
"Brennan: You see that you guys are… They're gonna get some swings on you now. That's a hit on Kingston. Is that a hit on Ricky? I don't think so. No, it is not. That's a miss on Kingston on the next one. And a hit on Iga. Kingston, you take 20 points of damage. And I think only one of them hit you, right Kingston?"
"Lou: Yeah, that's what you muttered to yourself, yeah."
Brennan: Great.
[Emily laughing]
Lou: What's the Con save for concentration?
"Brennan: Oh, that's right. Iga, you take 21 points of damage. I'm also gonna need a Strength saving throw from Kingston and Iga. And concentration is DC 10, Kingston."
Lou: I got an 8 on the Strength saving throw.
"Siobhan: I rolled a natural… Sorry, go ahead."
Lou: Okay. Nat 20 on the concentration check.
"Brennan: Cool. Kingston, I'm gonna need another Strength saving throw, because you going down that first time, means that the other one rolled with advantage."
"Lou: [disapproving] Oh, what's this? What’s this?"
Brennan: It's how it goes.
Lou: The second Strength saving throw is a 7.
"Brennan: You take 21 points of damage, and I'm going to need another concentration."
Lou: Is this 'cause I said that thing about you muttering? Alright? Cause you—
"Brennan: Sorry, sorry, 18. It's 18 points of damage to Kingston. And I'm gonna need that second concentration."
"Lou: So, DC 9 or DC 10?"
Brennan: DC 10.
Lou: That's gonna be a 19. A natural 19. Alejandro is not going anywhere. Me? Maybe.
"Brennan: These knights, [mimics galloping] well, actually sorry, no hooves, just ghostly surging forward floating in the air and lances rake out across Iga. Sorry, what was your save again, Iga?"
Siobhan: I rolled your natural 1.
Brennan: You are prone as well.
Zac: Can you use luck?
"Siobhan: I can, but I only have two luck points left. And I think I can, 'cause I can activate my Elemental Gift as a bonus action and then just fly away."
"Zac: For sure, for sure."
"Siobhan: Like, prone to the ground, I think. I don't think I need to get up necessarily."
"Brennan: Incredible. Ricky, that's gonna be your turn."
"Zac: Okay, do I have my Divine Sense still going? I felt the celestial being being killed, but I wasn't sure if the Divine Sense had any sort of ping off of these ghost knights?"
Brennan: You're not getting anything off of these animated suits of armor other than them threatening the unicorn here.
Zac: Can I hold up my sword and see if it feels like it matches the time period of them?
Brennan: Give me a History check with advantage.
"Zac: Okay. Got it. Ricky has a plus 0 to history, but I rolled a 19."
"Brennan: Hell yes, you feel like probably from these knights, it's probably from the time period."
"Zac: Okay, all right. I'm gonna just attack. Let's do that."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
"Zac: All right. Does a 20 hit, or 19 hit?"
Brennan: A 19 does not hit.
Zac: Fuck.
Emily: Ooh.
Lou: [flipping Brennan off with both hands] Wow.
"Emily: Ooh. Brennan was in a bad mood when he planned this session, huh?"
[cast yelling and laughing]
Emily: I know.
Siobhan: Brennan was in a very good mood when he planned it.
Lou: Something tells me after we whooped those clowns…
Siobhan: He did this a lot. [mimes tapping her fingers together like an anime villain]
Lou: My man took a little extra lunchtime. Put a little bit more work in during lunch.
"Siobhan: Oh, you're making fun of my clowns? Well, I'll show you."
Lou: Yeah.
Emily: I think I'm still giddy from getting conned into using my opportunity attack. [laughs]
Brennan: Incredible.
"Zac: Fuck, 13 misses too."
Brennan: Shit.
"Zac: So, I missed twice. And I'm gonna use a bonus action to cast Sanctuary on JJ."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You got Sanctuary on JJ. With that Divine Sense, you sense another celestial presence other than the unicorn from deeper within the gallery as well."
Ally: Fuck.
Lou: That’s what I thought.
"Zac: Gosh. Could I, I might try to take my movement… I feel like I gotta protect… Can I just take a step up just to see if not leave the threatened area? Well, I guess I do need to leave. Sorry. I kinda just want to see what's in here. [laughs] I want to just go here."
Brennan:  Cool.
Zac: I guess he gets an attack of opportunity on me.
"Brennan: He does, he's gonna take a swing. That's a Nat 20."
Murph: God.
Brennan: Ricky takes 19 points of damage from that knight.
"Zac: Okay, I'm gonna Rebuke the Violent. And... As my reaction, and make him take 19 if he fails to save."
"Brennan: He's gonna make that save. On a natural 8, he fails. Takes full 19 points of damage. [mimics small explosion]"
"Zac: Okay, I'm gonna to move over here and I'm gonna see if Ox can take JJ to this corner over here."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: That's smart.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. He can do that right away, no sweat."
"Siobhan: Wait, what kind of damage are these guys doing?"
Brennan: Piercing.
"Siobhan: Oh, okay, cool."
"Brennan: Okay. That is going to be JJ, who has just moved in with everybody else."
"Zac: Can I make a Perception check now that I've moved in here, 'cause I see something and I don't know what it is."
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and give me a Perception check."
Zac: That's a 16.
"Brennan: Yeah, you look and see a kneeling, colonial, continental army uniform with a musket and bayonet. With a readied action…"
Zac puts his face into his hand and laughs quietly.
"Brennan: ...the uniform takes a shot and you are barely missed with a musket ball, boom."
Ricky: What is that? [shrieks]
"Lou: Okay, so not fun stuff."
"Brennan: So this uniform fires at you, and the musket ball runs away."
"Siobhan: Oh, this other one is the samurai. So, this is the muskets in where you are and the other one is samurai weapons, in the Met. I don't know if it's like that in this thing."
"Brennan: Yeah, there's a ton of stuff."
Emily: The one across the way?
"Siobhan: Yeah, the one that Ricky isn't in. The ones to the south."
Emily: Yeah.
Siobhan: In the actual Met is like samurai weapons.
"Brennan: Yes, you see that there are different armors and stuff running around in here with different stuff. JJ is gonna make a History check real quick. He's got a plus 8 to this as well. 17! JJ holds out his hand. Cantrip shatters the glass, and tosses a musket to you, Ricky. He's like,"
"JJ: Ah, it's got no ammo, but it's from that dude's time period!"
"Ricky: So, I can hit him in the head with it?"
"JJ: Yeah, I think so!"
"Brennan: Iga, that's gonna be you."
"Siobhan: Okay, I'm going to activate my Ghostly Gaze, so I can see through solid objects including with Darkvision to a range of 30 feet."
"Brennan: Hell yes. You guys see a fencing sort of renaissance figure with a rapier, but it has not seen you. It's smashing the glass. You're back over here."
"Siobhan: I am going to activate my Elemental Gift, so that I can fly."
Brennan: Awesome.
Siobhan: And I'm gonna fly up. I'll take the opportunity attack. I don't see any other way of doing it. I'll move to like here.
Brennan: You take 13 points of damage and are now up high altitude out of the reach of their lances. Hell yes.
"Siobhan: Hang on a second, Misiek still has to go."
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Siobhan: I'm actually gonna send Misiek into this second... And I'm telling everybody what I see in all of the places.
"Brennan: Cool, great. So, Misiek's gonna move right in there, bam!"
"Siobhan: Okay, great. Can I use my Ghostly Gaze to see if there's anything inside this armor?"
"Brennan: Sure, the armors are all empty. They're purely animated."
"Siobhan: Okay, that's good to know."
"Brennan: Awesome. After Iga goes, hell yeah. Ricky, you see that a suit of armor wielding a scimitar several centuries old from the Ottoman Empire begins to... sees you in the hallway and charges at you with a double move, ending its turn right here."
"Zac: Oh, that's what I thought attacked me earlier. That's what I could see. Oh, okay."
"Siobhan: Oh, okay."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: Cool.
Zac: Cool.
"Brennan: That's its turn. Cody, that's you baby."
"Murph: Sweet. I don't suppose I'm so lucky that the questing blade… It's throughout the ages. So technically, I mean, that's of all things' ages, right?"
"Brennan: Give me a History check, Cody."
Murph: Okay.
"Brennan: I'll set the DC the same as Zac's, which is a 15."
"Murph: Okay. I'm rolling like shit today, 6!"
[Emily laughing]
Brennan: Looks like the questing blade actually may not cut it on this one.
Murph: Okay.
"Ally covers the camera with their hand, then pulls it away sharply and pretends to be shocked, wheeling their arms."
"Murph: Then this glass case here. Oops, sorry. Let me make sure I'm on the right thing. This glass case here, does this look like the same kind of armor and weapons as the guys in here?"
"Brennan: Yes it does, absolutely."
"Murph: Great. I would like to… It's 45 feet away. Assuming I have my moped, 'cause it's my steed, I would like to just do the charging attack. [laughing] Just essentially just run my moped into the glass as hard as I can."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Great. You smash it into the glass. Go ahead and just give me an Acrobatics check if you'd be so kind.
Cody: Yeah! Fuckin’ yeah!
"Emily: Oh my God, this is so embarrassing. A moped accident."
[laughing]
Lou: In the Metropolitan Museum of Art of all places.
"Siobhan: It just donks into the glass, doesn't make a dent."
Murph: The idea of riding a motorcycle around a museum is absolutely a dream that Cody has had.
Emily: We are in the dream world.
Zac: [Cody voice] Wouldn’t it be sick?
Murph: [laughs] Would be awesome.
Siobhan: [Cody voice] They should fuckin’ just let you take the city bikes in there.
Brennan: Incredible. What was your--?
Murph: My attack?
"Brennan: Or, give me a Dexterity saving throw."
"Murph: [laughs] Awesome. Uh, 18."
"Brennan: Cool, you don't take any damage as you smash through the glass."
"Cody: [crashing glass] Fuck yeah, fuck yeah, dude."
"Brennan: Great. You grab one of the weapons from this time period. Go ahead and give me a History check to see what if you can grab a good weapon from this case. This is definitely the right case, but go ahead and give me a History check."
Murph: Come on. 12?
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah, you grab a longsword. Not as good as your questing blade, but you grab a longsword off of one of the suits of armor. You have a weapon from the time period."
"Murph: Sweet. Okay, so I've used 45 feet of movement. I may need to hop off my moped to keep going, 'cause I only have 60 feet of movement. Okay, I am just going to… Let's see, what do I have? Is it 15 feet from the mopeds to this guy?"
"Brennan: Oh, just about, yeah."
"Murph: [laughing] Great. I'll smash it, grab something, then keep going with the moped and go after this dude."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. It's a full joust, baby. You're on a moped with a sword. You grab it out of a smashed piece of glass."
Cody: You have no idea how many times I've been to Medieval Times.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an attack roll.
"Murph: Sweet. First things first, let's start it with a Thunderous Smite as a bonus action. And then, I will make an attack. [claps] 27 to hit, with a nat 19."
Brennan: That's gonna hit.
Zac: Hell yeah.
"Murph: Great. So then I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go all out just this once and have fun. Just this one time. So, I've got, I'll just roll it right here. So, I've got 1d8 from the longsword, plus 1d8 from my new improved Divine Smite. I will do a third level Divine Smite to get 4d8's."
"Brennan: So, that's 6d8 so far."
[dramatic music]
"Murph: And then, 2d6 from the Thunderous Smite. Oh, and I didn't add my bonus, plus 9."
Brennan: Ooh!
"Murph: Oh wait, no. Plus 8, because it's not a plus one weapon any more. So, plus 8. So, 43 damage on the first attack."
"Brennan: Damn! Plus 8, 43?"
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: You ride up on your moped and, like a baseball bat hitting a tin can, just crunch in a huge section of the barding on that animated armor, looking hurt."
Murph and Ally: Hell yeah.
Brennan: You have another attack.
"Murph: Sweet. My... [laughs], I'm so stupid that this is flavored as a moped. My moped, oh wait, my moped did an attack. It rammed into the thing, nevermind. Rolled a nat 1."
Brennan: Oh no! You way overextend and kind of skid and hit your knee on the ground. Your moped kind of topples over a little bit. You're taking a big swing off of a moped.
Cody: Ow! Shit!
"Zac: I'm imagining all the sounds that Ricky heard, 'cause he cannot see this. Sort of like… [imitates moped engine, then glass breaking]"
[laughing]
"Murph: It's like, ""Oh shit, where is this from? Oh, this one will do, it's fine. [yells] I must go all out all this once! Oh fuck! Ow, my knee!”"
[laughing]
Brennan: Incredible.
Ricky: Seems like he's doing okay.
"Brennan: The continental soldier closes with you Ricky, and is going to take some bayonet attacks. That is a nat 20."
Murph: Jesus.
Zac: Shit.
Brennan: Yikes.
"Lou: Now, these aren't clowns at all. These aren't true clowns."
Brennan: These are not clowns. I was also rolling very badly during the clown fight. I just want that—
Lou: Uh-huh.
"Siobhan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what they all say. It’s never happened before."
Brennan: [high-pitched] I was too!
Siobhan: Oh my goodness.
"Brennan: Incredible. 7, Jesus! 15, plus 5… Ricky, you take 20 points of damage as this guy runs up and bayonets you."
Zac: Ow.
"Lou: What are you at, Ricky?"
Zac: I'm at 66.
Lou: Cool.
"Brennan: Sofia, that is your turn."
Emily: Okay.
Zac: Can I use my Channel Divinity to try to make him take that 20 damage as well?
"Brennan: Um… Yes, you can."
Zac: I can't remember if—
"Brennan: No, you got your reaction back. You do have your reaction back."
"Zac: Okay, cool. I'll just do that."
Brennan: Let's see.
Zac: Wisdom saving throw.
Brennan: Wisdom saving throw DC—
Zac: 16.
"Brennan: Oh, these guys have a minus 4 to their Wisdom save. Yeah, absolutely. 20 points of damage, right to him, blam. Incredible. Sofia, that is your turn."
"Emily: Okay, do I get the vibe that the rooms that Ricky and Iga are in, 'cause there's three different doors going into it and I can't see, but do I feel like it goes into one big room? So, Ricky and Iga have line of sight on everything that's in there?"
"Brennan: I think you, you've been to the Met before. So, you know that once you're in the middle of one of those side galleries, there is a straight hall that goes all the way to the rest of the side galleries."
"Emily: And then is there… Do I get the sense that there's something deeper down here? I'll use the ruler to point, down this way."
"Brennan: You do. I think you do sense that there's other stuff down there, yeah."
"[quick, tense music fades in]"
"Emily: Okay. I think for now I'm just going to, I want to punch in the, I want to punch in the glass case and grab maybe two sort of like coat of armor… [patting the back of her hands]"
"Brennan: Oh, gauntlets?"
Emily: Gauntlets.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Hell yeah.
Emily: Do I get the sense that will hurt these guys right here?
"Brennan: Yes, you absolutely do. Go ahead and give me a History check just again to see how good of a thing you can grab."
"Emily: Okay. I mean, History check? [laughs] 15."
"Brennan: Yeah, you run up and smash the glass with the elbow, kshhh, and you grab… You guys see Sofia now has the cat paws, around, giant… Sofia you're not the tallest woman in the world so, you have these, your gloves, you look like Hulk hands. These are huge medieval gauntlets."
"Sofia: They're nice, I should give ‘em a manicure."
Brennan: [laughs] Go for it.
"Emily: Okay, and then I'm going to attack this rider."
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Emily: And what I'm going to do, let me see, okay. First attack, ooh, that is gonna hit! That is 27 to hit."
Brennan: That hits.
"Emily: And now I add a d4 radiant, right? 'Cause I'm at less than half."
"Brennan: You absolutely do, that is correct."
"Emily: Boy, I rolled poorly though. So, he takes 9 damage. Going to attack again. 13 plus 9, 22, will that hit?"
Brennan: That hits.
"Emily: All right. I rolled two 1s. I'm rolling so poorly. So, that's another 7 damage. And then, do I get the sense that these spectral creatures that if they… that they can charge up in the air? Like if I jumped up on top of this on top of this case that I just punched a hole in. If I jumped up on top of that, will he still be able to charge me?"
"Brennan: It looks like no. Iga soared up above them, and one of them kind of lunged and levitated back down to the appropriate height for a mounted knight."
"Emily: Okay, then I'm gonna spend a ki point to hop backwards onto that case."
"Brennan: Cool gotcha. Great, great, great. Hell yeah. And you're not even out of its threatened area if you're up on that case, 'cause it does have 10 feet of reach with that lance heads up. So, that lance is pretty long."
"Emily: Oh, in that case, why don't I just jump? I mean, I have my full movement. I have Jump cast on me. I could literally just jump my fall movement."
Brennan: Up to the ceiling? Cool.
"Emily: Yeah, up to the ceiling."
Brennan: He's gonna get a swing as an attack of opportunity.
"Emily: Oh, no, I used a ki point to disengage."
"Brennan: Cool, then you're totally good. You just dodged a natural 19."
Emily sticks out her tongue with a grin.
"Brennan: That is Sofia Lee's turn. Pete, that's you. You are still in hiding. I'm also gonna need a, I believe you're on one, two, three. Give me a wild magic surge for last turn."
"Ally: All right. Hey, four."
"Brennan: Cool. One, two, three, four."
Siobhan: How does that keep on happening?
"Ally: Yeah. Okay, I would like to go straight to this thing that's already been crashed open by the moped."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: And get a weapon. Is that a roll?
Brennan: Dope. Go ahead and give me a little History check there.
"Ally: Let's see, that is a 16."
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah, you can just grab a sword straight up, longsword out of there."
Ally: Are there any guns in there? Any muskets or anything like that?
Brennan: Not in this one. You'd have to go into some of the side chambers to look for those.
"Zac: And they might be for different time periods, right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: Gotcha. Okay, then I grab a sword and then I have, wait. [sighs] Okay, I'll just use the sword, nevermind. I was gonna do some fuckery, but I decided not to."
"Brennan: If you want to do some magic and some fuckery, you can absolutely go for it. Also, if you want to combine one of these historical items with a spell, that's also totally okay."
"Ally: That's my question. Okay, here it is. And feel free to veto this But I wanted to obviously use Quicken Spell, so that I can cast Minor Illusion and get ready for the fuckery. We are in dreamland. So, potentially an illusion can become real. I am going to Minor Illusion a vial of dysentery"
and pour it on this sword.
"Brennan: [laughing] Cool. Hell yeah. Yeah, if Pete wants to do that, do that shenanigans, go for it."
Ally: Does it change anything about the sword? Okay.
Emily: I want to watch this and see this Minor Illusion thing.
"Ally: Yeah. Let's see. Well, I can't really get to anybody. I guess I just have this sword ready. Is that what I want to do? Interesting. You know what? Yeah, okay, we'll just stick with it."
[Zac laughs]
"Ally: Let's just fucking stick with it, I made my bed. And I put dysentery all over it."
[cast laughing]
Ally: I got diarrhea in my bed. Nothing left to hide with. God dammit. Shit the bed.
Murph: Do spells not work?
"Zac: I think spells would work, right? I mean, I dunno."
Ally: Oh really?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can… If you want to do some spells, do some spells."
"Ally: Wait, I thought like, no, it all had to be from the time period. That's just with weapons? This changes everything."
[Emily and Murph laugh]
"Brennan: Yeah. Do spells, Pete, go for it."
Murph: Could you use Minor Illusion to just wave the sword like a wand and shoot a Fireball instead of giving it dysentery?
[laughing]
"Brennan: I love the creativity, don’t get me wrong."
Emily: I feel like the illusions are real.
Murph: You absolute maniac.
Zac: You eventually die. You eventually die from bubonic—
"Murph: Yeah, exactly."
"Ally: Listen, everybody [laughs] I'm just trying to think outside of the box."
Siobhan: Three to eight days these ghosts will die of a painful death.
Ally: Why on earth would I ever do any of that? No one can…
[cast laughs]
"Ally: I simply, let's see. I'm just gonna cast Cone of Cold"
[Murph laughs]
"Ally: And I'm just gonna do a normal Cone of Cold try to… Let's see, 60-foot cone. Can I hit both of these?"
"Brennan: I think so. Yeah, for sure."
"Ally: [sings as they measure the distance] Da-da-da-da-da. Yeah, they're only 15 feet apart."
"Brennan: Oh, absolutely you can hit both of them. Yes, yes, yes."
"Ally: Cool, I cast Cone of Cold and I Minor Illusion some dysentery onto that cone."
[Emily laughing]
Siobhan: Real brown water.
"Brennan: Pete, go ahead and give me an Arcana check real quick and then give me that cone of cold damage."
"Ally: Okay. Ooh, Arcana is 25."
"Brennan: Pete, you're in dreams. You clock, you read one of the plaques about, okay, like late 1200s. Grab that sword and just slash a hole in time open to an incredibly fierce blizzard from the 1200s here in dreaming."
Ally: Incredible.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll your Cone of Cold damage.
Emily: Is the Cone of Cold gonna come through? 'Cause they're [laughs] dysentery.
Murph: It's just shit and snow.
"Zac: It’s frozen, but the bubonic plague."
"Ally: So, a Minor Illusion a scarecrow, and then I have everyone worship me. Okay, that's 38 to each."
"Brennan: Incredible, they both failed their saves and take full damage."
Ally: Incredible.
Zac: Have we killed anything yet?
"Siobhan: No, not yet. Not anywhere close."
Emily: I'm in really bad shape to do anything [laughs] without being able to stun. Maybe other things can get stunned though.
"Brennan: They're looking hurt, hurt, hurt. That is gonna go from Pete's turn. Things moving around in the dark."
[dramatic music]
"Siobhan: Oh, here he comes. Here is that samurai."
"Brennan: Moving out there, bada-boom. That's going to be Kingston, that is you."
Lou: I call to Sofia.
"Kingston: Sofia are you going hunting, or are you just staying out of the line of fire?"
"Sofia: Oh yeah, so I don't mind being a little hurt, but I am gonna just keep disengaging to sort of keep myself from getting attacked. I think I'm in a position that I won't be able to get super hurt a bunch."
"Kingston: Okay, are you going further into the museum to see if there's anything else there or are you—?"
"Sofia: Yeah. I have Pass Without, the unicorn cast Pass Without Trace on me, so I thought yeah, I might, I might stealth it."
"Kingston: Goddamn, that is kind, okay."
"Sofia: It was really sweet, yeah."
"Kingston: Great, well, we'll hold it down in here."
"Lou: Okay, Brennan, shenanigans question, can I call on those same thoughts and feelings that allowed me to float earlier to now fly?"
"Brennan: I will allow you to call on those same thoughts and feelings to roll either Athletics or Acrobatics with advantage. Yes, absolutely."
"Lou: Wait, but can I fly? That's my real question. I'm not interested in hovering anymore. I'm now interested in fly."
"Brennan: I'm gonna need Kingston to make a flat Wisdom check without proficiency, because Kingston is not practiced at whimsy and you need to, on a flat Wisdom check, if you hit a 15, you can levitate a little bit off the ground. And on a 20, you can fly this round. It's a round to round thing."
"Lou: Great. So plus 5 to the roll, 15 I can levitate, plus 20 I can fly?"
Brennan: Correct.
"Lou: Oh, that's a 14."
Brennan: Oh no! You just try to summon the thoughts and grounded reality comes in and spoils your happy thought as you attempt to fly. What does Kingston do?
"Lou: Great. I can’t, I'm like within his 10 foot reach of this guy?"
Brennan: With both of them actually.
"Lou: With both of them, okay. I think I'm gonna, hmm… I'm gonna, [groans nervously] I’m gonna disengage."
Brennan: Cool.
[Ally laughs]
"Lou: I'm gonna disengage. I'm gonna go five… I'm gonna come and, this seems dumb. Oh, come on. I gotta… Yeah, I'm gonna disengage and dart into like, here."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Lou: Oh, and there is stuff going on in here. Great, I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna disengage. Let's see, how far can I go?"
"Brennan: You can get through the doorway, and you'd be out of the reach of those knights."
"Lou: Okay, I just don't know what's in this room."
Zac: I can tell you.
Lou: Okay.
Zac: Where I'm at?
"Lou: Yeah, I'm in here now. Yeah, I'm just gonna come in here. It's just weird, 'cause it's like—"
Ricky: There's two dudes in here.
"Kingston: The darkness is very, it's upsetting."
Ricky: I can't see really much at all.
Kingston: Me neither.
"Lou: [laughs] Okay, yeah, I disengage and run into this room where they're not big knights."
"Kingston: Oh shit, okay. Oh, there's shit in here too."
Zac: Are you up here?
"Lou: Yeah, I think I just ran… I'm just out of your reach."
Zac: Okay.
"Siobhan: If you go up one more square, Kingston, you can see through— you can see down the whole hallway."
"Lou: Okay. Okay, perfect. Okay, yeah. I could see down the hallway."
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: What a thrill. There's a lot of broken cases up ahead, y'all."
"Brennan: It's actually going to be, JJ slipped in the initiative a little bit. So, JJ is now going to go. He's going to throw a Fire Bolt right at that continental soldier."
Ally: Hell yeah.
Zac: All right.
Ally: Where is JJ?
"Lou: King shit, JJ."
Zac: Top left corner.
Brennan: 19 hits!
Lou: JJ!
[crew applauding]
"Siobhan: Yes, JJ!"
Brennan: Hell yeah. We love to see it.
"Lou: We love to see it, JJ."
"Brennan: He deals 8 points of fire damage to that thing. [burning flame sound] Throws a bit of flame at it. And that is going to be now I believe, now it's Alejandro's."
"Lou: Yeah, so he'll close with that knight, first attack. Does a 23 hit?"
Brennan: 23 does hit.
Lou: Okay. Is there anyone within 10 feet of him?
"Brennan: No, I don't believe so. Or no, Cody's within 10 feet of him, yeah."
"Lou: Cody, have you taken any damage?"
"Murph: I don't think so. No, not yet."
"Lou: I don't think it matters. He does 17 points of damage, and then gives Cody 17 temporary hit points."
"Cody: Holy shit, thank you."
Brennan: Holy shit!
"Sofia: Alejandro, this is a good incarnation of you."
Ricky: Yeah.
"Brennan: He says,"
"Alejandro: Listen, you put a wizard into paradise to study all of heaven's books. He does not get less powerful. You know that thing wizards say, where they go like, “Strike me down and I will become more powerful than you ever…” It's true, I am vastly more power—"
"Brennan: Hwaah! And just thuds with the mace into the like horse snout of this Barding. He looks at you and says,"
"Alejandro: You are Cody 'The Night Angel' Walsh, yes?"
Cody: [nodding] Yeah.
"Alejandro: I am Alejandro Ortiz. I am an angelic celestial benefactor, former head of the Gramercy Occult Society. Be well."
Brennan: And you see you are covered in protective runes and light.
"Lou: All right, and he'll go again."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Lou: That's a Nat 20.
Brennan: Holy shit.
Ally: Hell yeah.
[cast cheers]
"Siobhan: Yes, Alejandro."
"Lou: Alejandro come in after not focusing up, here he is."
Murph: After that first round.
"Emily: He focused. There was just too many people in the room, he was distracted and socializing."
"Lou: Exactly, I needed to get out of the room, so that Alejandro could focus up. That's gonna be 6, 7, so 13 plus 3, 16 plus 5 for 21 points of damage."
"Brennan: Alejandro yells at you, Kingston, and says,"
"Alejandro: Why did you leave the room right when I was going to do something cool for the first time? My best friend, I miss you!"
"Kingston: We're gonna do a lot more cool shit, all right?"
"Alejandro: Okay, wait one sec."
"Brennan: Alejandro turns and says,"
Alejandro: You face the wrath of a wizard?
"Brennan: His eye goes gold, he takes out his Juul. [takes a drag]"
"Alejandro: Peter, it's still cucumber habanero!"
"Brennan: In a runic smite, he not only thuds into this knight, he fully disenchants it and all of the armor thuds across the room. On a Nat 20, he reveals that disenchanting works particularly well against these animated suits of armor."
Lou: We love to see that. We love to see that!
Zac: Love to see it.
"Brennan: Incredible. Kingston with this summon, this summon is good, man."
"Lou: What's up, dude. Thank God you let us level up, 'cause I don't think I would've gone back to the spells and been like, “Oh, what's new?” I would have been like, “Well, I have what I need.” But no, thank you Unearthed Arcana."
"Brennan: Just in time for the Plate and Barding to go, you have removed one of the biggest enemies from the board right before their turn, baby. Cody, you're gonna get a swing, attack of opportunity on one of these dudes. As he backs up, go ahead and take it."
"Murph: Okay. This dude is quite hurt, right? 'Cause he took a Cone of Cold and my big hit."
Brennan: Yes.
"Murph: Okay, come on. [shakes his head] Um… 15."
Brennan: 15 does not hit. Two attacks on Pete.
"Ally: Ooh, two? Wait, doesn't Iga get an opportunity attack?"
"Brennan: No, because she's out of range."
Siobhan: Sorry.
Brennan: Those are two 19s.
Ally: Shield.
Brennan: You cast Shield. They both overcome the Shield. Each of them just got a 27.
Ally: Goddammit.
"Brennan: Pete, you take 49 points of damage."
[Ally whistles]
Lou: Goddamn.
"Brennan: I'm gonna also need the first four of those are eight, three, that's 16, 20, 26. I'm gonna need a DC 13 concentration check."
Ally: Okay.
Zac: What spell do you have? Oh.
"Ally: Hey, 18."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Next one is gonna be 8, 5, 13 plus 4 is 17, plus 6 is 23. Next is gonna be a DC 11 concentration check."
Ally: Okay. 17.
Lou salutes in relief.
Brennan: You pass both of them. The Unicorn stays safe.
Ally: Fuck yeah.
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: This dude is going to back up. This guy is going to continue charging past you to keep charging at Cody. This guy's going to charge Cody again. One's gonna get a second attack not as a charge. That one misses Pete. Two attacks coming as charges onto Cody. One of those is a hit. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Cody, you take 17, 22, final attack."
"Lou: Cody, what are you at?"
Murph: I'm still at 81.
Cody: 'Cause of the dude with the Juul. That dude rules.
[Brennan laughing]
Lou: He does rule.
"Brennan: Then that is Plate and Barding, as the knights charge through the room. That is now going to be Ricky."
"Zac: Okay. Can I hold my musket up in front of this guy with a musket in front of me, and have Ox bite it out of my hand and hit him with it, so it's Ox attack with the musket?"
"Brennan: Um, uh, yeah! 100%. Yes, go for it."
Emily: A dog with a gun.
Zac: Ox is going to try to attack this man with a gun.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: So that would be… He gets a plus 6 for, to hit for biting. Would that—"
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: Can I just use that?
"Brennan: Yeah, use that one."
"Zac: And he has Pack Tactics. And I'm right next to him, so he has advantage."
Brennan: Go for it.
Zac: Does a 14 hit this dude?
Brennan: A 14 does not hit this dude.
"Zac: Okay. Okay, well, that's Ox's turn. Pretty cool turn. I am, okay. So, Ricky is gonna take an opportunity attack, I think."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: And step back over here.
Brennan: Awesome.
Zac: To hopefully see those dudes. I'm gonna use Dispel Magic on this dude.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Whichever one doesn't look that hurt. I dunno if any look more hurt than others on first glance.
Murph: That one's not hurt.
Zac: The one fighting Pete?
"Murph: Yeah, there's only one that's hurt, I think. That one's hurt."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: One— yeah.
Zac: I'm gonna use it on the one that's fighting Pete.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Okay, this is a big one gang, hold on. Ricky's DC is 16. We're looking for a 12 or lower here, gang."
[dramatic music]
The roll is very nearly a 20 but instead a 14.
Ally: Can I—
"Brennan: Oh, you want to do Bend Luck?"
"Ally: Yes, please."
"Brennan: Go for it. Roll your d4. 2, that's exactly what you needed."
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: Pete, you warp the dream realm. Ricky, you rush in here, reach out to stop this harmful magic. The armor clatters apart, and falls to the ground disanimated."
Zac: Hell yeah. And I think I probably got an attack from that thing in the last room. I don't know if you rolled that yet.
"Brennan: Yes, we're gonna go ahead and resolve that right now. That is a hit. Ricky takes 8 points of damage from a bayonet."
Zac: Ow.
"Brennan: Incredible turn, Ricky. That's gonna be Iga."
"Siobhan: Oh boy! God, this is not… There's not an enormous amount that I can do."
"Murph: Iga, if you can do a little bit of damage to this dude in front of me, I can try the same thing Ricky just did. I also have Dispel Magic."
"Siobhan: Oh, you do?"
Murph: I can maybe take out the full health guy.
Siobhan: I'll Eldritch Blast the guy—
Brennan:  In front of Cody.
"Siobhan: In front of Ricky. He's had quite a lot of damage, right?"
Brennan: Correct.
Murph: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Okay. That is a, sorry, a 26."
Brennan: That's gonna hit.
Siobhan: A dirty 20.
Brennan: Dirty 20 hits as well.
"Siobhan: And then one that doesn't hit, a 12."
Zac: You get to fire three times? Wow.
"Siobhan: Yes, now that I'm 11th level."
Emily: Cantrips are good.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll your damage.
"Siobhan: Great. 6 plus 14, so 20 damage to him."
"Brennan: Iga, what do you, as you reach into the core of yourself, you're flying overhead, where do you go magically? This is the first real battle magic you are doing after having that confrontation with the ghosts in the chest and reaching out to that thing in the deep bottom of the castle."
"Siobhan: I weirdly think that in the past Iga's magic has looked very flashy but fake. And I think now she's just not putting any effort into that stuff. So it doesn't look as exciting, but it looks like real magic."
[quick piano music]
"Brennan: You guys see, Iga reaches out for this Eldritch Blast and a channel opens of pure legend. Helixing, flittering banners through the gaps of which you guys can see ancient forests and castles and swords flicker out. And this suit of ancient Eastern European armor from a castle in what would be modern day Poland, you connect with it and for a moment, the face of the ancient Polish knight that once wore this looks at you and in Polish goes,"
Knight: What the hell?
"Brennan: And collapses to the ground, disanimated. As part of you reaches out and connects with that story, and you feel something reach out and remember that story, the armor is, not only have you disanimated it, you've also mended it. It no longer has the injuries that it had before and it's actually perfectly preserved, though it is no longer harming you."
"Siobhan: And then I would like for Misiek to grab one of these, these are all broken in here, right? The glass is all broken, it's on the floor?"
"Brennan: Yes, correct."
"Siobhan: So, I'd like Misiek to grab a katana."
Brennan: Hell yes.
Siobhan: And then fly it out to Cody.
Zac: Fuck. [head in hands]
Murph: Oh hell yes!
Siobhan: 'Cause he's gonna need it in just a second.
Cody: Oh my God.
Ricky: Goddammit.
"Cody: This is the best day of my fucking life. Every day I wake up, this is the best day of my goddamn life."
"Zac: Ricky’s like, pretty hurt right now, like."
"Cody: First a fucking devil shows up, flying in a freaking balloon and fight people. Now I got just swords everywhere, free swords. Armor’s alive."
Ricky: Cool. Cool.
"Brennan: Cool, super cool. Cool. Misiek runs out and grabs that sword. This dude sees Kingston enter. He's going to step here. Make three attacks against Kingston."
Lou: Three?
Siobhan: What?
Lou: [high-pitched] Three?
"Brennan: Kingston, hits you for, Jesus I'm rolling well, for 25 points of damage. Gonna need two DC 10 concentration checks."
"Lou: 25, damage okay. Number one, oh, what's the DC?"
Brennan: 10.
Lou: That's a 9.
"Brennan: Brutal. You see, as it reaches out and slashes, Alejandro looks out at you, Kingston. It sort of surges past and says, “You guys—”"
"Ally: Oh, Bend Luck!"
Brennan: What's that?
"Ally: Can I Bend Luck? I'm so sorry, I should've been quicker with that."
Brennan: No worries.
"Ally: I mean, it's no matter what, right? 'Cause you were one off."
"Lou: Okay, great. So now—"
"Brennan: Hold on, what was the last thing you bent luck on?"
Zac: You bent luck on my turn for Dispel Magic.
"Murph: Yeah, it’s a reaction, right?"
Zac: Have you done it twice since—
Emily: It probably will take a reaction.
"Brennan: Takes a reaction to do, I'm pretty sure."
"Ally: Yeah, it does take a reaction. My bad, sorry, sorry."
"Brennan: No worries. ...But I also want this to not happen. [consideringly] So, I'm gonna do just a straight up Pete, give me a wild magic surge in order to go ahead and give me a wild magic roll one through four, as you reach deep into your—"
Ally: 13.
Brennan: 13? Great. You may burn more sorcery points to Bend Luck in this instance to keep Alejandro here. I'm gonna need that second DC 10 concentration check from Kingston.
Lou: [laughs] That's a nat 1.
"Brennan: Oh no! Pete, you reached out and Bend Luck, spend the sorcery point for the extra reaction. And Alejandro goes,"
"Alejandro: Yes, we're going to… Oop! [boom]"
"Brennan: And you see that, Kingston, you are slashed by this weapon but also feel something severs the cord that Alejandro is connected to you here by. Alejandro vanishes to paradise and says,"
"Alejandro: Kingston, Kingston, I will be waiting for you in the JFK of Nod. At the Cinnabon, find me at the Cinnabon!"
Brennan: And vanishes.
Ally: That sounds good.
Lou: Incredible.
Ricky: Nooooooo!
[laughing]
"Ally: Your ""NOOO!"" is to the idea of eating at Cinnabon."
Ricky: It's too many empty carbs.
"Brennan: Incredible. This fencer rushes out of one of the side galleries to close with you, Pete, but has no movement left. That is going to be Cody."
"Murph: Sweet. Take my new katana, do a little twirl. And then I go,"
Cody: I'll have to wait to use you ‘til later.
"Murph: And then I say,"
Cody: Two sides of the same coin.
Zac puts his head in his hands again.
Murph: And I cast Dispel Magic on the armor and wink at Ricky. [laughing]
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Zac: Just to really paint a picture, [laughs] for a Japanese person to see a man, a white man, with a katana. Look, look, it's the situation, it is what it is."
[cast laughing]
Brennan: Cody is a true shithead in this moment.
Zac: I know he doesn't mean anything by that.
Brennan: I love it so much.
"Murph: He used the Dispel Magic, not the katana."
Brennan: Incredible.
Ricky: Can you please just let me use it?
Cody: Do you want to use the katana?
"Ricky: I kind of do, I kind of do. I'm sorry—"
Murph: Can I chuck the katana to Ricky?
"Iga: Just 'cause the samurai guy was just about to jump out of the door towards Cody. Otherwise, obviously I would’ve given the katana to you."
"Emily: Oh, that's quite logical."
"Brennan: Oh yeah. Cody hears Ricky say that, and you have a free object interaction on your turn."
"Murph: Yeah, hell yeah. I'll toss the katana to Ricky."
[cast laughing]
Cody: I'm more of a Raphael anyway.
Ricky: [pained] Okay.
"Brennan: That's Cody's cultural reference for katanas. It's the Ninja Turtles! I love it so much. I'm more of a Raphael anyway. Cool. You toss it across. Ricky, you're holding the musket in one hand, you grab the katana in the other. Cody's DC is 16. These dudes need a 13 or higher, and we have no more Bend Luck coming from Pete. Here it comes. 11!"
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Bazathrax roars in your chest,"
"Bazathrax: Fuck out here, dude! Fucking get lost."
"Brennan: The armor collapses, boom! Last Plate of Barding. Last Mounted Knight of Barding. You guys will make quick work of those knights. Incredible. It's back to the top of the order, that's Sofia."
"Emily: Okay. I'm going to, just in case Pete gets hurt, I think… Do I have a concept of if Banishment would make the Unicorn re-emerge on the platform that it was banished from?"
"Brennan: Yes, it would reappear right there. You've seen Pete use Banishment before."
"Emily: Then, I'm going to cast Darkness in a 15-foot radius around where the Unicorn would reappear if they're unbanished, if Pete loses his concentration. And then I would like to stealth, I can walk on walls, so I would like to stealth into this next room."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
"Siobhan: Just like The Gift, like the ghost from… Not The Gift, the Grudge. Just like crawling around."
"Emily: Yeah, maybe I’m just like crawling on the ceiling. [laughs] Okay, so I have a lot of movement, so hold on. So, I guess I'll just kind of like walk around. And it's really hard to see here. Let me just try to measure, cause I—"
"Brennan: I would actually scoot back out four cells to your left, if you would."
"Emily: Four cells to my left. Oh, okay. So, what am I seeing here?"
"Brennan: You see the hallway around the gallery up here and you look down and see a hallway with the unicorn tapestries from the Cloisters down there. With the unicorn tapestries from the Cloisters, with the unicorn erased from the tapestries."
"Emily: Okay, can I then Step of the Wind and run to it?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
Emily: Where is it precisely? Is it down here?
"Brennan: Yeah. You run down there and as you now see, Sophie, the unicorn tapestries in the Cloisters, and something that is only here in Nod, stashed away, it is a giant plinth of stone."
Emily: Is it a sword in a stone?
[Siobhan gasps]
Brennan: It is a giant sword in a stone.
Ally: I think we know which one of us is gonna be able to pull it.
Murph makes a truly alarmed face at this.
[cast laughing]
"Emily: I mean, I guess I'm gonna do it. No, I'm kidding. [laughs] Okay."
Siobhan: You should try.
"Emily: I think even though I just stealthed in here, do I see any combatants in here that I'm gonna alert if I shout?"
Brennan: You don't see any combatants in here.
"Sofia: Okay, there's a sword and a stone in here. I'm a monk, so I don't need it. It feels like, I don't know, maybe someone really special with a heart of gold should come in here and claim this weapon. [laughs]"
Murph: You hear a moped revving.
[cast laughing]
Lou: Jesus!
Brennan: Incredible.
[Ricky yelling]
"Brennan: That's Sofia. Oh sorry, I actually forgot that our Continental army thing is gonna go. Ox is gonna get an attack of opportunity. Or actually, sorry. Sanctuary, right? JJ has Sanctuary on him."
"Zac: Yeah, so he has to pass the—"
"Brennan: It's a Wisdom save, right?"
Zac: Yes.
"Brennan: Absolutely fails the wisdom save, JJ is protected, but is gonna go for Ox."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: Hits Ox for 13 points of damage.
"Zac: Okay. Oh, okay, he's still up. He's got 19, so."
"Brennan: [barks] Ox yells at this… I was gonna take a second attack, Misses Ox on the second attack. That is now going to be Pete, that is you."
"Ally: Awesome, I am just going to take a full dash."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: And then, can I prepare a Cone of Cold?"
"Brennan: You already have Cone of Cold. You do by the way take 5 points of damage in an opportunity attack. Oh sorry, no, 10 points of damage from that Renaissance fencing attire as you move away."
"[spooky, discordant background music]"
"Ally: Gotcha. Okay, interesting. Actually, yeah, I'm just gonna ready a spell that I have as a bonus attack."
"Brennan: Oh, so you're gonna do Quicken Spell to ready the action? I will allow that particular shenanigans in this case."
"Ally: Amazing, and cool. I mean, I'm not quite sure what I'm preparing. Do I have to know that for sure?"
"Brennan: Yes, you actually, with a reaction, you need to give me what's gonna trigger it, and what it is that you're doing."
Ally: I am preparing Dispel Magic from my bracelet for like if someone magical comes up. One of these like empty--
"Brennan: Oh, you know that there's that, the renaissance fencing thing is right there next to you. Here, let me—"
Ally: Before I left?
"Brennan: Yeah, before you left, right here."
"Ally: Okay. So then instead of taking that 10 points of damage, maybe I'll just Dispel Magic on that and then do my big move. Then do Pete's big move."
Lou: Pete's big move!
Zac: [exaggerated Lou impression] Pete’s! Big! [laughs]
Lou: Move!
Brennan: Hell yes. This guy's got to get a 16 or higher to resist the Dispel Magic.
Emily and Siobhan: Yeah!
"Brennan: That is a four. Dispelled, bam!"
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: Incredible, Pete. That is Pete's turn, disanimated. Hell yeah. This incredible ornate suit of feudal Japanese armor comes roaring out of one of the galleries. And it's going to take two attacks on the Night Angel. Hits with both. 10 plus 10, 20 points of damage to Cody as that suit of armor slashes across your chest. JJ is gonna light up this suit of armor with a Fire Bolt again. Let's see how JJ does."
"Zac: Come on, JJ."
"Brennan: That's a hit, baby."
"Lou: Hell yeah, JJ!"
"Brennan: JJ reaches his hand out at this Continental Army uniform from the Revolutionary War and goes,"
"JJ: Fuck you, man!"
"Brennan: And a stream of flame, the felt catches. [fire roaring] The uniform is engulfed in flame, and he completely disintegrates it."
Zac: Yes.
"Lou: Yes, JJ, yes."
"Brennan: That animated armor is no more. Hell yeah, JJ. That is gonna be Kingston Brown."
"Lou: Hey, you know what they say? The hits keep coming. Let's go Dispel Magic on my man."
[Brennan laughing]
Emily: How did everyone get this spell? Wow!
"Siobhan: Yeah, I don't have this spell."
Zac: I literally just took it before today.
Emily: I'm impressed.
Zac: I think it—
"Brennan: Truly amazing. Once again, this dude needs a 16 or higher. This is not one of the big boys."
It gets a 12.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Kingston, this armor that somehow severed the cord that was bringing Alejandro here from paradise, or this thing didn't sever the cord, but is attached or alerted whatever did. What does Kingston do as this thing squares up with you?"
"Lou: I just kind of lean back a little bit and I'm just like,"
"Kingston: Whoever's on the other end of this, we're coming for you."
"Brennan: The metal bursts apart, brrring! And clatters to the floor harmlessly. [imitates crashing]"
Emily: Another intimidating phone call from Kingston.
[cast laughing]
Lou: All I need is a phone number. All I need is a phone number.
Emily: You’re hopping on the phone with everyone.
[laughing]
"Brennan: Incredible. Plate and Barding no more. Ricky, that is your turn."
"Zac: I'm so glad you did that, ‘cause I was about to toss the sword back to the Night Angel."
Brennan: Back to Cody!
"Kingston: I got you. I got you, Ricky, go get him!"
"Zac: [sighs] Okay. Ox is gonna move and pick me up, and we're gonna run all the way to the samurai."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Zac: So, that's—"
"Murph: I think I have one more third level. I'm gonna try to dispel him, although I could dispel somebody else."
"Zac: Actually, don't currently see—"
"Emily: There is this sword in the stone back here, Ricky."
Murph: There's just the one guy?
Zac: Might be it.
Siobhan: Yeah. I think this might be the last guy.
"Brennan: Ricky, Ox definitely has enough to get you to within charging distance where you could use your own movement to close the rest of the way."
"Zac: Okay, we'll charge over here with Ox. And I'm just gonna take two attacks on this suit."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, dude, go for it."
Zac: First attack. What are the stats of this katana?
Brennan: It's 1d10 damage.
"Zac: Okay, but to hit it's a 10 as well?"
"Brennan: You would use the same, so it's non-magical. So, it's just one less than whatever your magical sword would be."
"Zac: Okay, so does a 20 hit?"
Brennan: 20 hits.
"Zac: Okay. So, I'll just roll my second attack. Does a… Well, I'm gonna re- roll that. [laughs] Okay. And then a 27. So, two hits. First hit is a d8. If I'm using two hands, is it a d10?"
"Brennan: Yeah, it's a d10. So, you have a d10 here. And are you doing any smites or other stuff like that?"
Zac: I get the Improved Divine Smite no matter what.
"Brennan: So, it's a d10 plus a d8."
"Zac: Okay, and then I'll use Branding Smite."
Brennan: Oooh!
"Zac: So that would be, how much does Branding Smite add? It's a second level. So 2d6 from that."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: And then, yeah, I'll use a second level Divine Smite as well."
"Brennan: So, that's gonna to be, so yeah, that's 3d8 plus 2d… Or, so it's 5, it's 4d8 plus 1d10."
"Zac: Oh, I'm sorry. The Branding Smite is 2d6."
Brennan: Plus 2d6. 4D8 plus 1d10 plus 2d6. Do you want to roll your second attack just to confirm real quick? Or have you already--
Zac: I rolled that and I hit.
"Brennan: Okay, so you have another attack. Are you doing any smites on top of that attack or no?"
Zac: I haven't rolled it yet. Maybe I have to resolve this one first.
"Brennan: Cool, yeah, go ahead and resolve this one first. 4d8 plus 1d10 plus 2d6."
"Zac: Okay, rolled a 1 on the d8. But. So, 6, 8, 14 plus 9, 23 on that attack. Oh, plus two more d8, whoops. Great, so plus 10. What did I say, 28? Yeah."
"Brennan: So yeah. So wait, so that's 28 damage plus 10 is 38."
Zac: 38 on the first attack.
Brennan: Amazing.
"Zac: And then it, fuck it, another Divine Smite on this second attack. So, that would be one d10. So 10, and then 11. So, 27 on the second attack."
Lou: Whoa!
"Brennan: Ricky, you close with this katana in your hand."
Zac mimes holding a sword in two hands and makes a little ‘shk’ kind of noise.
"Brennan: Iga's presence— Faces flutter into the armor everywhere of the people that once wore them or made them. You step forward into this armor that has been animated with magic and you know that it's just magic animating this stuff. Because as the faces appear in them, the faces look confused to see their armor grappled by some force that is using it. And as you step forward, this armor turns, wide stance. Faces you in a moment of pure silence. You both move at the exact same time and you bury your katana in the center of the armor. A ghostly face fills the armor for a second. Looks at you, smiles. Is filled with warmth and sudden life as though remembered in perfect detail. Speaks to you and says,"
Samurai: [deep voice] Thank you for this… [bows]
Zac: I solemnly nod.
"Brennan: And you see, it says,"
"Samurai: Both for this release, and for not letting it be this fucking kid."
[Emily laughs]
Cody is doing sword tricks again.
"Ricky: I couldn't, I couldn't let that happen."
"Brennan: The armor clatters, you are all out of combat. Incredible."
"Emily: Since we're out of combat, can we maybe see the board now?"
"Brennan: Yeah, let's go for it."
"Murph: Yeah, I had no idea that we were almost done. I was just like, I didn't see any of the rooms."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Let's undo the--
Cast: [seeing the full map] Wow!
Lou: Very cool. Very very cool.
"Sofia: Just so that everyone knows, there is a sword in the stone back here."
"Iga: I do think for dramatic purposes, we should all try to draw the sword from the stone."
"Sofia: Oh, and have Ricky go last."
Iga: I’m just pitching it. I think it will be more satisfying when we fail.
"Ricky: Don't do this to me, y’all. Don’t do this."
"Iga: I just think, narratively—"
Pete: Me first.
"Kingston: It’s a race, right, it’s a race?"
"Sofia: [overexaggerated] Oh, it's so hard. It could never be for me!"
"Pete: What if it's me, though?"
Sofia: [unconvincingly] I'm trying my best.
Ally: I try to pull the sword.
Brennan: Incredible.
"Zac: Ricky's gonna tell Cody,"
Ricky: Thank you for letting me use the sword. I appreciate you tossing it to me.
"Cody: No, that was... I'm a fucking idiot sometimes. And I'm sorry that I've been, I don't know. I freaked out at you before about the sword and shit, but I know that it used to be your sword. And like, I don't know, shit's just fucked up."
"[gentle, emotional piano music]"
"Ricky: Hey, I mean, just to be clear, katanas are cool. They're just really, really cool."
"Cody: Right, yeah."
Ricky: They’re just really awesome.
"Cody: That was fucking, so, I just wanted to swirl it around and shit, but that was dumb."
"Ricky: Hey, I mean, I would like to swirl this around."
Zac: I just start doing this. [imitates Cody’s sword tricks]
"Cody: Hell yeah, dude."
Brennan: [imitates sword tricks] You vibe with the swords for a moment.
[Emily laughing]
"Murph: Yeah, I also swing the longsword around."
"Ally: I'm trying to pull the sword from the stone, but I'm doing it like this. [leans back and forth as they mime pulling with both hands]"
Ricky: Feels pretty good.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You guys go to the next room. I will say Cody and Ricky, you guys are swimming in swords these days. There's just so many fucking swords."
Murph: Just so many swords.
"Siobhan: Just, vwoom! Vwoom! Vwoom!"
"Brennan: You guys arrive in the next room. Hold on one second, let me just see. And yeah, you guys see this stone facing you. The Banishment fades, and a very wounded unicorn appears. Looks over at you and says,"
"Unicorn: Pete, oh my God."
Pete hugs the Unicorn.
"Brennan: And comes up and nuzzles your arm and says,"
Unicorn: I was one of the first people you saw in your first day in here.
"Pete: Yes, you were!"
"Unicorn: You are the sweetest thing. You got me out of trouble there, mister. I swear to God."
Pete: I hope you're okay. Where did it banish you to? Back to home?
"Unicorn: No, it was kinda like a three and a half hour acid trip wherever you sent me. But I'm fully back."
Ricky: Three and a half hours?
"Unicorn: Well, time was kind of suspended. Y'all, time has been weird in Nod recently. It's getting, like, shallow in here. I don't know if you all know that, but it's getting fucking wild."
Pete: Sure.
"Unicorn: Listen though, I'm so happy that you all are back. I haven't seen the other two of the three great spirits in a long time."
Kingston: You mean the juicy cockroach?
Sofia: I was gonna say the cockroach.
"Unicorn: The juicy cockroach and the spicy pigeon y'all, I have not seen them."
Pete: Oh no.
"Unicorn: That's always what it's been. It's the three animals you think of when you think of New York City. You think of a juicy cockroach, you think of a spicy pigeon and then just a regular unicorn, and that's me."
"Pete: Can you say spicy pigeon three times, please?"
"Unicorn: A spicy pigeon, spicy pigeon, spicy pigeon. What are you hearing?"
Kingston: Spicy.
Pete: I'm just imagining that you're ordering at Chick-Fil-A.
[laughing]
"Unicorn: I would not order at Chick-Fil-A. Honey, no, I would not be there. I don't support that establishment! No thank you."
"Pete: Sorry, yeah."
Brennan: Incredible. You guys approach this room with this incredible sword in the stone in front of you.
Siobhan: Does it say anything?
"Sofia: Ricky, if you're not gonna do anything, I'm gonna go look for a weapon for myself."
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: There is this enormous sword there. And you see that some words have faded from it. Once again, things being erased. It says, “Whosoever pulleth out this sword, is right-wise…” faded, “born of...” faded."
Kingston: You gotta be born the right way.
"Murph: Cody is just shaking, but having just had that talk is like,"
Cody: [literally vibrating] We should think about this and figure out kind of what we should do with the sword.
"Ricky: Cody, are you okay?"
"Cody: Yeah, I'm fine. Just that there's a sword there."
Ricky: We should definitely think about what we should do with it.
"Pete: I mean, Iga, you seem to be pretty powerful with this kind of stuff right now."
"Siobhan: Yeah, is there some kind of check that I can do?"
"Brennan: Yeah, give me an Arcana check. And go ahead and make that with advantage."
"Siobhan: Great. Yeah, 25."
"Brennan: You look at this sword and see that this sort of accompanied these unicorn tapestries from the cloisters. JJ takes a look at it as well alongside you. You see that this is not Excalibur, right? Real Excalibur would be back in England, but this is some kind of dream weapon that lives here in the arms and armory exhibit of the Met. But, something is deeply forgotten about it. There is some force out there erasing things. With that high Arcana, you would know that because this has just lived in dreaming and doesn't even have an analog in the waking world, whatever was written here is gone and gone for good. But that doesn't mean that something new couldn't be put here."
Siobhan: Okay. Is that something that I feel like I could do?
Brennan: To write something here?
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: You reach into yourself and feel a deep and powerful attachment to things, but not just things in a materialistic way, the story of things. You feel a deep power about the past and legend and myths. And, it's the fact that things are, some of the only, people go, people fade away, but the things they write and leave behind that live on past them, and that love of glittering treasures. Not because of their price, not because of their value, but because they are the stories of the things that came before us. You feel like you could write on this and make something."
Ricky: It's like a Mad Libs?
"Brennan: [laughing] As Ricky says, this is a Mad Libs. The sword gleams a little bit."
Ricky: [dejected] Oh boy.
"Siobhan: Wait, it says now, ""Is somebody the son of somebody?"""
"Brennan: No, it says, ""Whosoever pulleth out this sword, is right-wise” blank “of” blank."
"Sofia: I think that… Oh, you can go. I think it's kind of like a choose yourself kind of thing, isn't it? Like a blank slate."
"Pete: Yeah, anyone can probably take it. Yeah, totally."
Sofia: I think it's just someone who really deserves it.
Pete: I don't want this.
Sofia: I don't want the sword.
"Iga: Good of heart, perhaps."
Ricky: [sighs] I've been burned before.
"Kingston: Ricky, take the sword, come on, man."
"Sofia: Ricky, take the goddamn sword, I wanna go look for something I can fight with!"
"Pete: It's gotta be Cody, right?"
Lou: I push Ricky forward.
"Kingston: Come on, man."
Pete: I only see Cody with this sword.
"Brennan: It says, ""Whosoever pulleth out this sword, is right-wise” blank “of” blank. Ricky, I think you would know the… Well, maybe you wouldn't. But, JJ remarks and is like,"
"JJ: Yeah, it's like the King Arthur thing, right? King Arthur's Excalibur said, ""Whosoever pulleth out this sword, is right-wise King of England."" But this doesn't say King of England, it says..."
"Zac: I will say, I'll go… Ricky will walk up to it and attempt to hold on to the hilt and try to pull it out and say that he will be,"
Ricky: I'll pull this out in order to be the Protector of New York.
"Brennan: You wrap around the sword, you say protector of New York. Where is Ricky's heart at as he does this? Does he believe these words to be true?"
"[soft, driving music]"
"Zac: He believes the words to be true, but he, you know, there's… He has this other sword. He's been using other swords. He kind of feels lost in some ways, I think. But, knows that that's what he wants. Even if it's not this sword, that's what he wants to do."
"Brennan: As you go to pull the sword out of the stone... I think you have this sword in the stone. You're holding Peasant Sword that you got from Iga's castle. This musket, this katana, these like historical weapons around you. When Ricky says he's the protector of New York, and you said he's feeling a little bit lost. I think maybe Ricky feels like maybe it's none of these. You don't need this sword in a stone's permission to be the protector of New York. And maybe you don't... What is, I'm going to turn it over to you, Zac. Ricky's been looking for a little while. That Questing Blade is still over there. Peasant Sword, sword in the stone. What's in Ricky's heart right now? He's looking for answers. What is he thinking of as he stands on top of this stone? 'Cause it feels like the sword in the stone is not it for him. He doesn't feel like that's the answer."
"Zac: I think, umm… You know, I think he's realizing after looking at Cody that he's maybe not a sword guy. [laughs]"
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: Cool. Hell yeah.
"Zac: And kind of remembering his axe and remembering what that felt like. As I'm saying this, I'm also realizing I don't want to make the same weapon that Gorgug had, honestly. So, that's outside of the show right now. I'm just thinking of that."
"Brennan: No, for sure. Hey Ricky, if you look at where you are in the map, you're right near a staircase in one of these other side corridors. Every stairwell comes equipped with a fire extinguisher and a fireman's axe right in the glass case."
Zac: I tell everyone to take 10 feet back.
"Ricky: Get out of the way, 'cause of shattering glass."
Sofia: Can I just take the dodge action instead?
"Ricky: Yeah, you can take the… Okay, I trust you."
Ally: You're just like [moves back and forth] getting closer.
Zac: I take the butt of the musket and break it open and I take out the fireman's axe.
Brennan: All of you watch Ricky explode with light.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Ricky, you are the protector of New York. And, you don't need a magic sword to tell you that. You don't need some magic thing from an ancient castle. You need none of it. Any fireman's axe that you hold would have the properties of the hero wielding it. And the fact that this ax rests in glass cases to help people in their times of need, is all of the magic that Ricky needs to imbue this with the power of a true hero."
"Zac: I take the axe, sort of swing it around. [mimics Cody’s sword swinging]"
[laughing]
"Cody: Yeah, dude."
Pete: I have a question. Does anybody else really want this sword?
Cody: [unconvincingly] No.
"Sofia: I wouldn't be able to use it. I kind of want to look for something, but I can't use a sword."
"Ally: I'm wondering if... Can I, I mean, I know this isn't like a customizer, like dog chain engraver machine. But, if I walk up to it and put my hand on the sword and say,"
"Pete: Look, I need to give this sword to someone who I owe a lot of money to."
[cast laughs in shock]
Murph holds his head in his hands. Zac covers his face.
"Ally: Can this sword say, ""The hacker of New York."" [Brennan and Ally laugh] It's worth a try, okay? I just need it to be custom."
Emily: Try no matter what.
"Brennan: Ally, roll a d20 for me."
[laughing]
Murph: [hands on his head] Oh God!
"Ally: Okay, look, this old ass sword… Well, instead of hacker, can it just say exposer? Maybe that's a little bit more—"
Brennan: The exposer of New York?
Ally: The exposer of New York.
Iga: Think about what that word means. You're just thinking about the word. Think about what the word means. Don't have it say exposer of New York.
"Ally: This is going to say, the seer of all. I think that's something that fucking 53\/3N would get off on. Okay, what am I rolling?"
Brennan: What is your roll flat on the die?
Ally: 15.
Brennan: You go and yank and fully pull a muscle in your back.
[Ally and Emily laugh]
"Brennan: The sword will not come out of the stone at all. The unicorn goes,"
"Unicorn: Peter, why don't you come on and step down. I don't think that [laughs] I don't think that was gonna be, I don't—"
Pete: I get it.
"Sofia: I thought it was a nice try, Pete. I mean, actually, I don't know anything that's going on with you, so."
[Ally laughs]
"Cody: [strained] Okay. So just to be clear, nobody else wants the sword?"
Sofia: No.
Zac: [shakes his head] I’m okay.
Sofia: Unless it was like brass knuckles or something.
"Iga: No, Cody, you get it, you can try and take the sword from the stone."
"Cody: I am the wielder of the ultimate Double Blade, Thirsting Blade."
[vaguely Breaking-Benjamin-esque rock music]
Murph: [laughing] And I draw them both out.
Brennan: Where is Cody at in his heart as he—
Murph: 100% believes that he is the wielder of the Double Blade Thirsting Blade.
"Brennan: You guys see appearing in huge font, JJ looks up and goes,"
"JJ: My God, it's happening!"
"Brennan: You see it goes,"
Sword: [echoing] SOUL MELD! DOUBLE XP! WIN CONDITION! THIRSTING BLADE! DOUBLE WEAPON EXCALIBUR - LEGENDARY STATUS!
"Brennan: A double blade of the Thirsting Blade and Excalibur, becomes the Double Blade: Dark Excalibur / Thirsting Blade."
Murph is laughing so hard he can’t speak for a moment.
Murph: It’s like not even...
Sofia: Give it to me. Give me the Questing Blade.
Iga: I tried to stop this from happening.
Murph: It's like the worst sword. It's like 100% a worse sword.
"Brennan: Sorry Sofia, it's fused into one double weapon. This thing weighs easily 275 pounds. It is like 15 feet of steel. [laughs]"
Cody groans as he tries to do sword tricks with it.
"Brennan: And you see, as you pull it, you hear reverberations throughout the Sixth Borough echoing into the night. That's all for this episode of The Unsleeping City. Tune in next week."
Murph: Oh my god.
"Brennan: Truly, truly remarkable."
Zac: Oh god.

"(music plays indicating you should begin vibing, TUC-style)"
"Brennan: Hello one and all, and welcome to another exciting episode of ""The Unsleeping City."" I'm your humble dungeon master Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Cast: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Last we left off, in a flurry of dispelling and some quick history checks, our champions of New York City dispatched the animated armors at the Arms and Armor wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Memories in the sixth borough of Nod. Having tracked down the unicorn, one of the three spirits of our dearly departed friend, Kugrash, the dumpster druid."
Lou kisses his fingers and points up.
"Brennan: Shout out to Kugrash. We discovered the unicorn being menaced and attacked by various forms of armor here in Nod. Our champions, of course, in Nod to survey the threat to the city and finally get firsthand eyes on what has been washing ashore in the waking world from the Dreaming beyond. Having discovered a dreaming version of the sword Excalibur that has now been fused with the Questing Blade to become the new Thirsting Blade, Dark Excalibur, a 275 pound, basically an I-beam, that Cody has to have a point of contact with the floor to kind of be able to wield here. We now see that this new incredible [mild Cody impression] twisted nightmare double weapon now exists. And Ricky went and helped himself to a fireman's ax from an emergency case at the stairwell."
"Ally: Wait, did you take the ax or the… [mimes… spraying something?] That thing."
Siobhan: The fire extinguisher?
Emily: [incredulously] The fire extinguisher?
Murph: The fire extinguisher? That thing?
"Ally: You know, the like… [does a cool dance] Did you take that?"
"Zac: No, I took the ax."
Ally: Oh damn.
Emily: I took that.
Brennan: Sofia took that.
"Ally: I wrote down the wrong thing. Oh right, I forgot."
Siobhan: The sexy fire extinguisher.
Zac: On your list of all the weapons people have?
Ally: I just keep a master list. I like to keep inventory.
"Brennan: All of you begin to exit from the Arms and Armor exhibit. You now walk, Pete, with the unicorn by your side. You see that the unicorn heals itself and is also gonna go ahead and heal everybody else here."
"[soft, heavenly-sounding music]"
Emily: Oh.
"Brennan: This sparkling creature again is not like, is very much one of those Elven-looking unicorns where its legs and face almost looks like a mixture between a deer and a horse. It's not powerful and broadly built, but much like the unicorn from the tapestries of the Cloisters looks like a creature from some enchanted other world. This unicorn is not only sparkling with divine and celestial light, but also appears to have just run through a cloud of regular glitter which, so it's sort of doubled up here. And JJ looks around. You guys walk back out to the main entrance hall where you can once again walk out into Nod. JJ points a finger over at you, Ricky, and goes,"
"JJ: Hey man, I might dip over to the Native wing to liberate some of that stuff right now if you want to come check it out with me?"
"Ricky: Yeah, sounds cool."
JJ: Cool!
"Brennan: You see JJ create this, like, 2D kind of 8-bit portal and minutes later comes back with Ricky. He has a bag of holding next to him that even from the outside is visibly stuffed with belongings."
Zac: Nice.
Brennan: And he gives Ricky a high five. JJ also defeated one of the monsters.
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see your friend here is probably like a fourth level wizard now and is feeling chuffed, man."
"Lou: I’m sorry, what—"
"Ricky: JJ, normally I'm not a huge fan of fire, but that was pretty cool."
"JJ: Hey, you know, I feel like it's the dream realm and it's about being, but you know what you are right, my man. Safety first, I'll be more careful next time. But that was awesome."
Siobhan: What wizard school is JJ?
Brennan: JJ is actually Conjuration.
"Siobhan: Oh, okay, cool."
"Brennan: But his focus in Conjuration is not as a summoner. It is as a teleporter. So, he's all about, like, Conjuration as teleportation, movement through planes, and also like kind of communication magic as well."
Siobhan: Cool.
"Zac: I was just gonna ask JJ, like,"
Ricky: Was there anything you were particularly excited about grabbing or was it just making sure you got all the stuff that felt right to take back?
JJ: Just making sure I got all the stuff that felt right to take for the most part.
"Iga: You know, here's the trick with museums. It's like an iceberg. Only like 1% of the stuff is in the galleries. You gotta go down."
"Brennan: JJ opens up and goes,"
JJ: Chill as hell. I'm gonna be super right back.
Brennan: [blooping] Teleports downstairs. And you guys hear reverberating through the Met on the dream side.
JJ: [faintly] Oh my fucking god!
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Cool, the rest of you are assembled out in the great hall with the unicorn. The unicorn looks and says,"
"Unicorn: [sighs] Yeah, listen. You know, of the three totems of New York, I am the only one that is a mythical creature. So, I've been able to move freely in Nod for a long time, but I haven't seen the spicy pigeon or the juicy cockroach in probably a couple of years."
Sofia: A couple years? Did they get dispelled when Kugrash ate the bagel?
"[soft, somber music]"
"Brennan: You see that the unicorn says,"
"Unicorn: It's hard to say. We… the first time I remember meeting them, we all were kind of called to each other back in the mid 90s. And it was around that time that shortly after, we kind of came to be. We were found by Kugrash who was able to communicate with us. And that's actually, prior to that, Kugrash had been living just as a rat in the sewers trying to survive, but he came into contact with us and dedicated his life to helpin' the, you know, the people that New York kind of overlooks or forgets, I suppose. And through his devotion to them and then to us, he discovered his magic and his powers. Couple of years ago though, yeah, when Kugrash left, our connection weakened somewhat but there was always sort of a thread I guess that was still connecting us to the city. I never knew where it went 'cause I wasn't feeling as strong as I used to be, but."
"Brennan: The unicorn concentrates, and a little silvery thread goes from the unicorn's heart and faintly travels out towards one of the members of your group and lands on Ricky's heart. And the unicorn looks up and sees a connection to you. Anyone here who wants to can make an Insight check."
Lou: Why not?
"Emily: [shrugging] I mean, in case I crit. I crit!"
Siobhan: I got a nat 1.
[cast laughs]
Murph: Oh my god!
"Brennan: Sofia, you look at it connecting to Ricky's heart but also connecting to his Helping Hands Homeless Outreach Center T-shirt."
"Sofia: Oh. Ricky, the unicorn is connected to you now. You've kept the unicorn around."
"Brennan: And with that nat 20 Insight, Sofia, you feel that there's something else coming from Ricky's aura. You could probably match it by, like, by spending a point of ki to, like, illuminate something around Ricky's aura that you can see now that you're here in dreaming."
Emily: Yeah. I think I real quick do a bunch of pressure points on him to illuminate his aura.
[Zac makes sounds of pain]
Emily pretends to quickly poke him.
"Brennan: You see two other cords of light spring out from Ricky's heart, traveling in other directions and fading as they move out into the material world. So, the other two spirits that are in the waking world, you can see cords of light connecting Ricky to them as well."
"Sofia: Ricky, I know that this is not what you expected to discover about yourself today, but I think you're connected to the juicy cockroach and the spicy pigeon as well."
Ricky: [nods] Okay.
[cast laughs]
"Pete: So, Cody is the Jersey devil, and you're kind of the leader of the spicy pigeon and the juicy cockroach."
Ricky closes his eyes in exasperation for a moment.
"Sofia: Okay, okay. Just really focus on—"
Murph: Cody tries to lift his sword to put on his shoulder.
[cast laughs]
Sofia: Just really focus on the fact that you are representing Kugrash.
Ricky: Yeah.
"Sofia: Like, you're almost, you took on something from Kugrash that he couldn't do anymore, and that's beautiful. Even if it is a juicy cockroach and a spicy pigeon."
"Ricky: I'll admit when I wanted to sort of honor Kugrash by taking up this mantle, I did not assume that I would also take upon his aesthetic."
[cast laughs]
"Ricky: And that is something I have to think about a little bit, but overall, I feel like this is a net positive."
"Sofia: Well, aesthetic is overrated."
Emily: And I look directly at Cody.
Ally: I give Cody the help action so that he can dance with the new sword.
[cast laughs]
[Cody groans]
"Pete: Come on, man. Come on, man. I'm spotting you."
"Cody: You have to lift more, Pete!"
"Brennan: You see the unicorn goes,"
"Unicorn: Oh my God. That's why we've been able to hang on without Kugrash here. That's really miraculous, Ricky, I have to say."
"Brennan: The unicorn looks out and says,"
"Unicorn: We became very weakened. I wasn't really able to leave the tapestries into the waking world anymore. But again, I've always had a very different relationship to the city because of my mythical nature. The spicy pigeon and the juicy cockroach both,"
"[muffled giggling from Murph, Emily, and Siobhan]"
Unicorn: Everyone always laughs when I say spicy pigeon.
"Sofia: It's honestly the, it's the combination of both. It's just knowing that they're part of Ricky now. Yeah."
Pete: It's the perfect word for a pigeon that I didn't know I needed.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: You see that the unicorn says,"
"Unicorn: Basically, those creatures faded into the waking world. And I believe right now they're kind of hanging on for dear life and that they've embedded themselves in mortal beings that they felt the strongest connection with. Similar to how, you know, Pete or Kingston were chosen as Vox Phantasma or Vox Populi. I believe that two other beings out there in the world have been chosen as the spicy pigeon and the juicy cockroach."
"Emily: With my nat 20, do I know if Perry the Pigeon is the [laughs] pigeon that—"
Siobhan: Spicy pigeon?
"Brennan: I think Sofia has thought a lot. Sofia, the year after your bender you went on after Kugrash died."
"Emily: Oh yeah, I hung out with rats and pigeons."
"Brennan: Yeah. Even in your bender, Perry went to such a dark place that you were worried about Perry the Pigeon for a while after Kugrash passed."
[Emily sighs]
Emily: All right.
Zac: So does that mean is that it could be Perry or not?
Brennan: I think that you have a hunch that it might be Perry the Pigeon.
Sofia: I think that if this spirit was weakened and it entered the body of another pigeon that that pigeon would take on sort of this burden. Also Perry was really attracted to Kugrash. And I think that also made him take it hard.
"Ricky: Gotcha. Well, I guess we'll have to figure that out. We'll have to talk to that pigeon and—"
[Emily and Murph laugh]
"Ricky: I don't know. I don't know. Maybe, maybe then it's, I guess I hang out with that pigeon now or...? Yeah, okay."
"Iga: Maybe it is like a Captain Planet type situation. You and the pigeon and the whatever the cockroach thing is you put in your hands and then you have, like, extra flying powers or some shit. I don't know."
"Ricky: Here's hoping, here's hoping."
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: JJ comes back from downstairs with a bag of holding that is now truly, like bursting at the seams, going like,"
"JJ: Woo! Man, this— [shaking his head]"
Ricky: We got it.
JJ: We got it.
"Brennan: He opens up his laptop. [beeping, typing] And looks around at stuff and goes,"
"JJ: Okay, I don't know what else you guys wanted to do here, but I'm super down to, I'm getting some measurements and readings on stuff that Esther asked me to look for. But I also know that Pete, you have business here in the dream realm of your own."
Pete: Mm-hm.
"JJ: But I'm getting some pretty fascinating readings myself on some of the stuff that I'm looking for, like trying to track raw Umbra."
"Brennan: And you see that he turns his laptop around in his hand and shows a kind of, like, orbital version of Nod that he sort of mapped out on his laptop screen. He uses a cantrip to fling the screen out into three dimensional space in front of you and hits a little clock icon in the upper right. Boom, boom, boom. And the clock transforms into an hourglass that sand is coming down, and he makes a swirl sort of like, spiral pattern of the sand that then begins to show the kind of celestial movements become more, like, organic. And you begin to see as it slows down almost to, like, a slowed down heartbeat rate, like boom, boom. Boom boom. You see all the raw Umbra, and you also see these little tiny flashes of what you can only describe as, like, pure rainbow light. Almost like a firework that has multiple incandescent colors of sparks in it, just like. And they are not evenly spread out. They are clustering in like some places more than others. Looks like they're clustering a lot near Bryant Park and the New York Public Library. You see them kind of clustered as well way out in Queens near the Queens Center Mall. Does anyone want to make any Investigation checks or ask JJ anything in this moment as he kind of spreads the screen out?"
Emily: I'll just do an investigation.
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Can I do an Insight check on JJ who's now dipped and gotten, like, a bag full of stuff from this museum?"
"Brennan: Yeah, give me an Insight check."
Ally: That's 16.
"Brennan: JJ looks very excited. He's just liberated a tremendous amount of cultural artifacts from a museum where they were just, and now that Iga pointed out that the truth that museums only display a tiny fraction of what they have. Things that were just sitting in cold vaults are now gonna be returned to the communities and peoples that actually created and cherish those artifacts. So, JJ's looking psyched."
"Ally: Incredible. Okay, great."
Emily: I got a 16 on my Investigate.
"Brennan: 16 on Investigate. Sofia, you are looking at this, and you see yeah, clustering around the Gramercy Occult Society. You see some around Queens Center Mall. You see another where you recognize the Central Park Carousel would be."
Emily: And the Cloisters?
Brennan: Cloisters as well.
Iga: Why is it at the Gramercy Occult Society?
"Sofia: Yeah, that is what I'm wondering."
Pete: Would that just be the Umbral Engine?
"Brennan: JJ points at Pete and says,"
"JJ: I think that's right, Pete. These flashes. So, you can see raw Umbra moving throughout here, and you can see that the raw Umbra is carrying some of these particles that we talked about before or as Ricky said, a New York minute. These particles are 60 second increments of time that on a quantum level create a sort of fractal image of themselves that is faster than the speed of light. That has a lot of different effects to it. But the raw Umbra moving it, there's always been some amount of raw Umbra in Nod, but you can see that it tends to flow to the Gramercy Occult Society because the Umbral engine is grabbing that raw Umbra and spinning it into the Umbral Arcana to protect the Unsleeping City and the people of New York."
Sofia: But now other people are taking it.
"JJ: Right. Well, it looks like… I don't know how these other sites are managing to create this effect."
Brennan: And then you see JJ thinks for a second about having sent a portion of his research with his application into Gladiator.
Sofia: What about the Pine Barrens? Pine Barrens in New Jersey? Can you see that?
"Brennan: He's gonna make a check to try and go see that. He goes down to the Pine Barrens in New Jersey. It does not appear on the map. And he looks and goes,"
"JJ: The other side, the spectral realm above the Pine Barrens, which dream — there was very little dream realm in Pine Barrens."
Brennan: And he lays another filter to show an infernal layer over the Pine Barrens which has also been collapsed into something like two-dimensional and maybe even less than that.
"Pete: So, something pushed this Umbral out, and something maybe also pushed those devils out like we were seeing overflow?"
Brennan: Everyone give me a Perception check real quick.
Siobhan: 21.
Murph: 17.
Ally: 13.
Lou: 31.
Brennan: 31 from Kingston.
Emily: Dirty 20.
Murph: Why do we even roll?
Brennan: Kingston—
"Lou: I do two things, baby. I look and see around and within."
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Kingston, you know where you're gonna find another infernal level, like the one in the Pine Barrens. You scoot over back to New York. Just like. Now that you're on the infernal layer, you see a collapsed infernal layer, just a tiny, tiny bit. And as you zoom in, Cody, the Hot Topic at the Queens Center Mall, like every Hot Topic, was an infernal gateway."
Cody: Of course. Of course.
"Brennan: As you look here, Kingston, you— (laughs)"
Cody: This adds up.
Kingston: I guess so.
"Sofia: The world just keeps validating you, Cody."
"Murph: Just like an absolute moron, just, rubbing his chin and just being like,"
Cody: Yes.
"Ricky: You crack it wide open, Cody?"
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: On a 31, I'm not even gonna make you guys travel out to Queens in Nod to, like, investigate this yourself. You zoom in on JJ's thing, and you look and see where this pressure being applied from the deeper dreaming, where the tide came in. Also Kingston, you remember from three years ago the lesson you guys learned from Nod which is that all these other realms, the reason, like, is Dreaming as powerful as like Heaven or Hell or Faerie? Arguable, probably in some ways, yeah, the devil is stronger or the archfey or whatever, but these places all started as paragons, right? Like, Faerie became such a potent dream that it came out. So, Dream does, whether or not it's the strongest, it is the oldest and things originated here which means that powerful magics can find the genesis of places like this. So, when you attack from Dreaming, you have a way to sever or attack hell-gates and other things like that. And especially in a place that you still see the highway hex is active, right? Even three years later there's still these highways that fuck up the ley lines and prevent other things from coming in. Weirdly in this case, the highway hex seems to be obfuscating some of this so that you guys couldn't have discovered it sooner, right? You look at that image and see that this force was coming in to choke and suffocate this hell-gate like it is doing across the city everywhere to everything. And as you look, you just recognize that that force is kind of a powerful tidal force, and some fractional amount of what it was suffocating and pushing down would have been extruded to other places. You're like maybe 80% of what was in that hell-gate got pushed back into Hell. The 20% would have gotten pushed somewhere else."
Lou: Yeah.
Murph: Bazathrax just got squeezed out like toothpaste or something.
Ally: Bazathrax got shit out of hell into your chest.
Siobhan: [rock singer voice] Like a shit outta hell!
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Bazathrax in your chest goes,"
"Bazathrax: What's up, dude? Are you talkin' about me up there? What's going on?"
"Cody: Yeah, you just got, you just got squeezed out of Hell? Is that what happened?"
"Bazathrax: What, dude? No, I got, well, yeah, kinda. I don't know. It was like, I was hanging out near this hell gate and there was this like and I was talking to this. There this infernal codex that I found that had my name in it. And then dude, this frickin' stuff came in. I didn't get squeezed out. The book got squeezed out. I was like, you know, your codex got fuckin', and I got squeezed back into Hell, dude. And I was like, I gotta get that codex that has a way to summon me in it! And then it was like, I dunno, like a month or two. I was trying to find a way to get out. But these highways and shit. [points] And then you said my name, dude. I don't know how you got your hands on that book but I'm glad ya did."
"Cody: So, you're just like the me of Hell pretty much?"
[cast laughs]
"Bazathrax: Hey, but you're pretty cool, man. That sword looks frickin' awesome, dude."
Murph: Cody swings his sword.
Ally: I give you the help action.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me that Athletics check and try to swing your sword.
"Murph: Okay, with Pete assisting."
[cast laughs]
Murph: That's an 11. Even with help.
"Brennan: You scratch up the floor pretty bad, but you cannot get the blade up off the ground in this swing."
"Pete: Dude, don't worry, man. We'll work out together."
"Ricky: What I'm wondering is — is this like, is this like a natural disaster or is this intentional?"
"Sofia: Or is it an entity that is not, doesn't have intention but has power enough?"
"Pete: I mean, I think we need to figure out what is in that beyond that is pushing against all these things. It seems like something that is grasping for power but —"
"Sofia: Yeah, something's coming in with the tide."
"Ally: Oh, can we get to Nod? I would really love to talk to Nod."
"Brennan: Yeah, it might be time for you guys to split up. With that 31, Kingston, I'm also gonna say that you perceive in JJ's thing, in JJ's sort of read out, a measurement of time that is sort of, it doesn't look right. Like, the amount of time that JJ is measuring doesn't look right to you. And on that 31, I think that Kingston's not the most versed in, like, advanced physics, but you remember JJ saying that he was studying these time particles, and you watch, as everyone else is talking, you watch the scale of JJ's map, not of space but of time, diminish by a unit. It looks like JJ doesn't notice it either. But you just watch. It goes from like, you know, negative 50,000 to positive 50,000 to like negative 48,000 to positive 47,000."
"[mysterious, slightly ominous music]"
"Kingston: JJ, what is that?"
JJ: What's what?
Kingston: What's that? The number went down. I don't know what the number means. Why would it go down?
Brennan: JJ looks at it for a second.
"JJ: That's not, that's really not good. [puts his hand on his forehead] So, I didn't know about raw Umbra when I was first studying New York minutes, but basically… So I don't know how much, like, pop science you guys have read, but like one of-"
Kingston: None.
JJ: [sighs] Okay.
Ricky: I don't think I've really read any either.
"Pete: I've read a little bit, yeah, for sure."
"Kingston: You were reading ""Mind Breaker,"" right? Did they talk about it in ""Mind Breaker?"""
"Ricky: No, I mean. [laughs] They're alluding to some stuff. It's mostly kind of went over my head to be honest. I think there were big chunks of paragraphs that it felt like I could skip, but yeah."
Pete: Oh cool.
Ricky: It's my favorite book though.
[Emily laughs]
Pete: Sick.
Kingston: Sick.
"Brennan: You see, JJ goes,"
"JJ: One of the biggest sort of axioms of quantum mechanics is that we actually have seen that observation can change the fundamental behavior of atomic particles, of cosmos, of nature. You know, for a thing being able to exist in two places at the same time. And I sort of haven't put this together before, but raw Umbra and the Umbral Arcana as well literally prevents people from seeing magic which would of course affect the nature of magic. Now, in our case, it's good because, like you've seen, without the Umbral Arcana if regular people were seeing magical things either they would all discover the magical world and that would shake the earth to its very foundations, or possibly they could observe the magical world and destroy it by not believing in it. There's a very real chance that if a bunch of people that didn't believe in something were able to see it that they would actually change the magical nature of that."
Pete: Whoa.
"JJ: This belief is a powerful, toxic substance in some cases."
"Iga: That happened with my daughter, I think."
Pete: I was thinking about that with the borscht bites that you were talking about.
"Iga: She stopped believing, even though we had grown up, like she knows. She knows that magic is real, but for a moment she just did not believe it. I had-- It was very strange and very upsetting."
"Brennan: Iga, you remember that Umbra coming out of her eyes, and JJ looks and says,"
"JJ: I suppose it's possible that with enough of this Umbra present in the city even people that had been invited into the Unsleeping City could be so... for lack of a better word, poisoned by it that they would stop believing. You know, depending on dosages, you know some amount of this stuff is very helpful, but in the amount that it's congregating in now and this time disappearing, it's almost like the Umbra is not just erasing the things but also it's not just occurring in space and preventing people from seeing things in the space around them, but it's also occurring in time."
"Brennan: Pete, give me an Arcana check."
Ally: Ooh! 23.
"Brennan: You have that same realization that Kingston had about the nature of time and the fact that so much of the dream realm is tied to potential. And those Gladiator signs disappearing. You see a mirroring in JJ's screen, almost like as something erases the past it is also mirroring that erasure in the future. And the far ends of those numbers in JJ's scale are time. And it's a pushing in in both directions of like, as possibilities disappear people forget the myths and legends and stories of the past. And as people lose their stories, they forget what is possible in their future."
"Ally: Is that why, with Josefina we don't know what happened to her?"
Brennan: You connect that erasing force to what deprived the museum of those two Vox Phantasma and their final memories.
Ally: Wow.
Siobhan: Can I have a look at my chest and see if it's changed at all with us being in Nod?
"Brennan: You take the chest out. In Nod it is glowing with resplendent magic. As you take the chest out, all of you see in JJ's screen all of the raw Umbra is pushed out of the Metropolitan Museum of Memories. And you see that a bunch of the New York minutes that have been carried on the raw Umbra, congregate, and you see JJ's screen flickers out. And you guys see actual little floating helixing particles of light and energy that look almost like time helixes. They become visible only at the last second of their approach. And, for lack of a better word, gleefully explode into sparkles on the surface of the chest. It's the first time you've seen that the the New York minutes are doing something differently than just being passively carried by raw Umbra. Like, pew pew. As they do, the wood on the chest animates, and you see the wood of the chest shifts. There is a sudden bodega. You see the wooden figure of Sofia releasing a cat from a cocoon. You look back, and you see Pete like flying through the air over Times Square. You see Kingston Turning Undead on the subway cart and the zombies collapsing. You look back and see Ricky jumping through a burning building with a young girl and a teddy bear in her hand. And as these particles — pew pew — hit and then stop."
"Ricky: So, the New York minutes it feels like they are, like, potential. They want to be stories."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Pete: Yeah. Do you think, Iga, that we could take your chest to the memories section of, here in the Met and maybe use it to protect us and try to see more memories than we would if there was a lot of Umbra there, like, congesting it?"
"Iga: Yeah, let's see if it works."
Pete: 'Cause I would love to see maybe the final moments of Josefina or Hans Fischer or maybe see if Tony's memories are in here anywhere.
"Iga: Yes. Yeah, let's do it."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: I remember when I encountered that shadowy figure, the vision that it gave me was of Nod being pulled away from me almost as a tide. So, was that maybe the threat of me losing my belief in Nod?"
Brennan: Give me an Insight check.
"Ally: Ooh. Insight, 15."
"Brennan: Either you, yeah. I mean, you think it's both. You think it's you losing your connection to Nod and whatever's out there. And Pete, I think you have a feeling that whatever is out there physically in Nod in the same way that you are able to go to Nod in your dreams with your dream self, things that exist physically in the dreaming still can appear mentally in your dreams. And when you think, like, losing my connection to Nod, you just feel the horrifying power of losing your connection to things and look through one of the windows and see the stars in the sky ripple. And a few fade out."
"Ally: Wow, fuck."
"Brennan: But you and Iga do have the chest, and you can go to the museum to look specifically for those memories. You also know that Nod is still somewhere off here sick in the dreaming."
"Ally: Yeah, fuck."
"Brennan: But for anyone else, I guess if the whole party wants to go move and do that that's totally fine as well."
Zac: I'm just feeling like Ricky's gears are turning faster than they ever have. [laughs] He is thinking in ways that he's never thought of.
"Ricky: It feels to me like if the particles are behaving differently when they're viewed that Gladiator is viewing it on a massive scale and I'm curious to see, like, what is beyond the research, like, is there any other nefarious, like, who is making that happen? You know?"
Pete: Oh god. Do they have a streaming service?
[cast laughs]
Kingston: Yeah. Gladiator Prime.
Pete: That they're gonna use to like...
Kingston: It's got great shows.
Pete: Gladiator Prime.
Cody: Is it the energy drinks too? Can people get in your brain?
Kingston: It keeps people from dreaming.
Ricky: It keeps people from dreaming?
"Sofia: Yes, it keeps people from dreaming. But I also think if Gladiator is observing magic not as magic but as something that's useful to them, that might be a form of disbelief. If they're using it not to dream but to serve their own purposes in a different way. That could be a form of observation that is disbelief."
"Ricky: Well, like, if people dream, then they can, then it's not Gladiator's. Right?"
Iga: They want to steal the dreams.
"Ricky: Like, if they take people's dreams but use the potential source of it."
"Sofia: To do something else. Like, to treat it almost like science or a resource."
Kingston: Yeah.
"Pete: Yeah, a resource for sure."
"Iga: Yes, so they can sell the dreams because dreams are free. Dreams have always been free, but if they can sell it, then you can monetize the dreams. God, what a nightmare."
Pete: Should we split up?
"Sofia: [dejectedly] I mean, Cody, you were right all along."
Pete: Yeah. And honestly.
(Murph laughs)
"Pete: I'm just gonna say, Ricky, that was really smart."
"Sofia: Yeah, Ricky."
"Pete: Ricky made some cool, you know. Hey man."
Ally: I put my hand on Ricky's back and I give him the help action to wave his ax.
[cast laughs]
Ricky nods and sort of wiggles his wrist.
"Pete: Your heart's not in it, man."
Ally: I give you the help action to have your heart be in it.
"Ricky: It doesn't feel like a good idea to wave this thing. This is really sharp, and this part's definitely sharp."
Sofia: That's true. Be true to yourself.
"Pete: Yeah, for sure, man."
[cast laughs]
"Pete: Should we split up and some people go to the memories, and I go with Nod with some people? Or should we stay together?"
"Kingston: I need to head out to JFK. I have a date at a Cinnabon with Alejandro. He said that he had something to tell me. So, people are more than welcome to come, I'm sure. But I think I do need to make a stop there."
"Sofia: I'll be honest. I probably shouldn't go to JFK, but I mean if I say I'm not going to, I'm gonna stop there anyway."
Pete: Do you wanna go with me to the memories and look at the Tony memories? Maybe you would recognize some stuff as the ex-Fist?
"Sofia: Oh yeah, I could do that. I mean..."
Ricky: You seem like you wanna go to the airport.
Pete: Sounds like you wanna stealth to the airport like two steps behind Kingston the whole way.
Kingston: You can just walk alongside me if you want.
Pete: Just in Kingston's shadow.
Sofia: I just feel like you can probably tell me what the memories say of Tony's.
"Pete: Yeah, definitely."
Zac: So that's decided. They go to the—
"Sofia: Pete, I do have something that I need you to ask for Nod. Does everyone mind if I just have a private moment with Pete?"
"Kingston: Yeah, of course."
"Iga: No, sure."
"Sofia: Pete, I was wondering if when you talk to Nod if you could ask them something personal for me?"
"Pete: Yeah, definitely."
Sofia: I was just wondering if you could ask them if in this place of potentiality and becoming and dreams if there's any way to bring someone back?
Pete: Dale?
"Sofia: I was thinking Kugrash. No, obviously Dale."
Pete: Oh cool.
Sofia: Obviously Dale.
[cast laughs]
"Pete: Yeah, definitely."
"Sofia: Just, you know, maybe ask. That's all."
Pete: I get it. It's hard to talk about your ex in front of your new crush.
[Emily laughs]
"Sofia: You know, I just, I figure you owe me one since you turned me down so hard."
"Pete: No, yeah, I will definitely ask Nod that."
Sofia: Thank you.
"Kingston: Pete, did you say that Nod needs medical help?"
"Pete: Oh fuck, right! You should be there, Kingston."
Lou: Can I hit Nod on the way to JFK?
"Brennan: Yeah, I think that probably, like, Pete would probably have to fly you guys up to where Nod is. So, looks like the three big tasks ahead of you are, like, going to snoop around in the Museum of Memories, heading to go deal with Nod, and then heading to JFK."
"Iga: What about you guys go to JFK, we do the Metropolitan Museum of Memory, and then we meet to the point where Pete has to fly us where to Nod is?"
"Kingston: Yes, Iga, yes!"
Ally: Can I do some sort of Arcana link with Nod and see if it's pressing that I get to them immediately?
"Brennan: You already can feel that they are in recovery and doing okay. You saved them from the bad situation, and Nod, while being a sweet little child, they are also a powerful monarch of dreaming. And you know, they can take some licks."
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: Cool. Pete, Iga, Ricky, Cody, and JJ are all going to head deeper into the Metropolitan Museum of Memory."
"Emily: Actually at the last minute, I think that after asking her selfish thing of Pete, Sofia is gonna do what she thinks is the right thing and stick around here and not go to JFK."
Brennan: Copy that. What's going on in Sofia's heart as she thinks about going to JFK or thinks about not going to JFK?
"Emily: I think that she feels like… She feels like she just heard Alejandro talking about paradise and the whole conversation with Dale was kind of like, I don't want you to be living for breaking out of heaven all the time. I think she also knows she has this box of Sour Patch Kids that she needs to attend to, but she's also like not sure if she finds out the results of that, if it would just be more hurtful to tell Dale."
"Brennan: Kingston, give me an Insight check."
Lou: It's only a 15.
"Brennan: Cool. I think Kingston maybe notices that Sofie is deep in thought. And I mean, he certainly notices that she changes her mind. But cool. Kingston takes off at the front door. I will say this though. JJ actually says,"
JJ: Should somebody go with Kingston just to make sure he's okay? I can go with Kingston.
"Sofia: Okay, fine. I'll go with Kingston, okay?"
[cast laughs]
Sofia: Kingston! If anyone's gonna fucking go it's gonna be me!
"Brennan: You see JJ goes,"
JJ: Whoa! I am sorry.
Murph: Cody was starting to go.
"Sofia: Sorry, I know you're scared of me, JJ. I'm not a scary person."
"Brennan: You see that JJ looks over at you, Ricky, who's the only person that he's told that he finds Sofia scary and he goes,"
"JJ: What the fuck, dude?"
[Emily laughs]
Ricky: I didn’t—
JJ: God! You told—
Ally: Can I talk to Sofia really quick?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it, Pete."
[gentle piano music]
"Ally: So I'm like,"
"Pete: Hey, you should go to JFK if you want. But also as somebody who is working through some stuff with some kind of unhealthy fallout from stuff like that we could like, you know, keep each other accountable."
"Sofia: [strained, about to cry] I appreciate that, Pete. I'll just be straight. I might be pregnant. And I feel like if I am, I probably have to tell him. And I don't. So I'm just kind of, you know, figuring out. It's maybe more complicated, right?"
Pete: I have three bricks of cocaine in my bag right now.
[cast laughs]
"Sofia: [wiping tears] Okay, okay."
"Pete: Just bricks on bricks, and I'm supposed to sell it. And I should honestly just flush it. We need to go to a bathroom right now and I just need to fuckin' flush it."
"Sofia: Is that why you tried to-? Yeah, no, let's do it. Let's go to a bathroom and you flush the cocaine, and I take the pregnancy test."
[cast laughs]
"Pete: Wait, you’re gonna pi— Okay, let's do it. Let's go."
"Brennan: So, right before you guys are about to split up, Pete and Sofia have this tearful thing. Both—"
"Zac: Ricky's like, they have to go to the bathroom right now?"
[cast laughs]
Lou: I was described as having left. So I'm just like wandering away.
Emily: I think it's fine. I'm really fast and can catch up if I need to.
Brennan: Kingston's just wandering away towards the subway.
"Cody: Kingston, they just went to the bathroom real quick. They just had to stop."
Kingston: Oh.
Pete: Just a second!
Iga: You've been in there like 20 minutes. What's going on?
"Brennan: Yeah, Pete and Sofia-"
Iga: If you need some prune juice I have some in my bag.
"Brennan: So, Sofia you're in a stall next to Pete who's on his knees flushing cocaine."
"Ally: I take out a knife and I just rip both bricks open, and it's the most counterintuitive thing I've ever done in my life. I'm just flipping them inside out into the toilet."
"Brennan: You're also in Nod. So this toilet sprouts two eyes and goes,"
Toilet: [Goofy-esque voice] Yum yum yum. I'm always hungry.
Pete: Oh shit! I'm sorry! I don't wanna get you high!
Toilet: [flushing] Woo! Holy shit! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"Sofia: Don't make it look fun, toilet. Whatever you do, don't make it look fun."
"Pete: Don’t do this to me, toilet!"
"Toilet: No, no, I'm not having a good time! I don't feel like I'm having fun. I just feel very productive. You guys wanna write a screenplay?"
Pete: Yes.
Murph: Toilet usually eats shit. You don't have to feel bad. It's fine.
"Ally: Okay, you're right. Okay, I like, I dump everything in there which is absolutely an insane amount of drugs. And then I wash my hands really quick, so I don't lick them. And then I just stand there like this. [holds their hands up in the air uncomfortably]"
(Zac laughs)
(Emily and Siobhan laugh)
"Brennan: Cool. Pete, awesome."
Ally: I should absolutely roll for whatever the fuck that was. We're good.
Brennan: Cool.
[cast laughs]
Brennan: And Sofia.
Lou: Oh.
Brennan: One second.
Lou: Gotta roll for pregnancy?
"Sofia: I just want to say, Pete, I just want to say thank you for doing this because I think the thing I was dreading the most was taking it alone because, you know, there was a time when Dale and I were trying and the idea of finding it out by myself was really, really-"
"Pete: Yeah, that's really major."
"Emily: But I'm still gonna Minor Illusion it just to be, like, Sour Patch Kids, just a stick of Sour Patch Kids."
Ally: You're just peeing into Sour Patch Kids.
Emily: I'm still not fully there with this experience. So I need a little bit of—
"Pete: So if it's a purple Sour Patch Kid, it's a positive. And if it's a yellow one, it's negative."
"Sofia: I figured if like one at the top smiles, it's positive."
(Lou laughs)
"Brennan: Hey, Pete, as you're done flushing the cocaine, Sofia steps out of her stall with a smiling purple Sour Patch Kid popping out of the top of the box."
Pete: Okay.
"Sofia: [sighs] Do you think that, do you think that, you know,"
Emily: I fill him in on what me and Dale's last interaction was.
"Sofia: Do you think that it is in his interest to know? Or is that me wanting him to know? Is it for me, me telling him, or is it for him? Is it good for him? Or is it bad for him?"
"Pete: I think you need to prioritize yourself in this moment maybe, so."
Sofia: I mean I'll tell him eventually.
"Pete: You have me and other support if you want. Or if, I'm just saying it doesn't sound like he's necessarily in a place to provide consistent support for you right now."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Pete: Also, sorry. I kept like being like, are we flirting? I just don't have very many like female friends and especially not in recovery. I'm just kind of in like a weird free fall. I’m sorry."
"Sofia: I can't tell you how convenient it was because my mother keeps trying to set me up with people. And when we went home from Kingston's party, she was pointing out attractive men. And I was able to just say, hey I took a hard pass for Pete. It didn't work out. I got rejected. And so now she's gonna cling to that for a little bit."
"Pete: Great, great. We can really play that up, but you know, I yeah. Okay, cool. We're just homies."
Sofia: Yeah.
[cast laughs]
Sofia: We are.
"Pete: Just me trying on new, like, friend language with my cool female friends. I don't have a lot of female friends which is kinda crazy 'cause I do have that POV in there somewhere."
Sofia: Yeah. I guess I'm sorry if this was really intense to experience such a female moment.
"Pete: No, no, it was cool that we went into the men's room for all of this."
[cast laughs]
"Sofia: I did do it in a urinal, which felt-"
"Pete: It was cool, yeah."
"Sofia: It feels like, you know, it feels like when you take an unexpected pregnancy test, it should be in the stupidest, most depressing way possible."
Pete: Absolutely. One leg up on a urinal just rocketing in.
Sofia: Peeing on a box of Sour Patch Kids.
"Brennan: Two eyes sprout up on the urinal and go,"
"Urinal: [low, gravelly voice] I just want to say congratulations. That’s all I wanna say."
Sofia: Thank you so much.
Emily: I shake its hand by flushing it.
[cast laughs]
Pete: Fuck! Um...
"Sofia: Okay, all right. Then I'm gonna go with Kingston, but I'm gonna go with Kingston, but I'm not gonna try to find Dale."
Pete gives Sofia a look.
Sofia: I'm not! I'm not! I'm serious!
"Pete: So, you're just gonna go to hang out at the airport?"
"Sofia: Well, Kingston needs detail."
Pete: [unconvinced] Mm-hm. Yeah.
[cast laughs]
"Pete: I just think you're gonna have to roll the dice a little on that choice, but it's up to you, Sofia."
"Sofia: Okay, I'll stay here. And I will process the many, many emotions I am feeling from this result. Thank you."
Pete: That's a lot though. That's really major. That's really fuckin' major. I've never been through something like that.
"Sofia: Yeah, I didn't expect it to be this way."
"Pete: Yeah, fuck."
"Sofia: Anyway, so yeah, JJ, if you want to go with—"
Ally: JJ's just in the bathroom peeing.
Emily: Can I cast Jump on JJ to try and give him a head start so he can catch up with Kingston?
"Brennan: He goes,"
JJ: Woo!
"Brennan: And begins bounding down the streets, like,"
JJ: Moon bounce!
Brennan: Cool.
"Pete: I'm a dead man. But yeah, cool."
(Emily laughs)
Brennan: Kingston.
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: You're like halfway to the subway right now. And JJ comes bounding after you and just goes,"
"JJ: Hey, what's up, man? I just wanted to make sure that you had some company on your expedish, unless you don't feel like you-?"
"Kingston: Oh, JJ, you're more than welcome, man. Yeah, come along. You ever wanted to see what Heaven's like?"
JJ: What?
"Brennan: He said,"
JJ: I thought you were going to JFK.
"Kingston: Here JFK is Heaven. It's pretty, come on, man. It's the Unsleeping City. It only gets crazier."
"Brennan: Kingston, as you say that train pulls into the station and takes off like a rollercoaster over the Manhattan skyline, just rails floating in sky. And you take off. We're gonna scoot on down to those of you in the Metropolitan Museum of Memories. Everybody who's in the Metropolitan Museum of Memories, go ahead and give me either Investigation, Perception, or Arcana based on, like, what you're looking for."
Zac: What are we looking for?
Murph: Yeah.
Zac: I'm not sure what we're...? Like what specifically.
"Emily: I mean, I'll look for memories of Tony."
"Ally: Cool, I'm gonna look for memories of the Vox that disappeared."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: On an expedition past Nod.
Zac: I'll look for the pigeon.
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I want to look for memories of, is this just stuff in New York?"
"Brennan: This is just stuff in New York, but you could look for other types of memories if you want. I think I would like to look for the other, like, other stories of Polish people coming to New York."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: And I rolled a nat 1, so I'm gonna use a luck point."
Murph: Oh my God.
Emily: Can I also keep an eye out for the thing that I asked Pete about to ask Nod about? If there are any memories like that?
Brennan: Yeah.
Emily: I rolled a 2.
Murph: Oh my god.
[cast laughs]
"Siobhan: Yeah, I rolled a 3."
Ally: I rolled a 19 arcana.
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: It's technically a 9.
"Murph: I think that Cody is now, I think the only way with which he has any kind of Insight or anything is in, like, sort of like a conspiracy type way. And so I think, like, it's starting to hit him like what JJ's doing with like getting back cultural artifacts, the things that like Ricky was saying to him, all of this stuff, and then all of the stuff with Gladiator. I think Cody is like realizing a little bit that he doesn't actually know anything about any of the things he's using. So I think, I don't know if it's a memory thing or I think Cody is going to kind of self-consciously go to the exhibit and just like read the things."
Brennan: Incredible. Incredible.
Murph: 'Cause he's like
Cody: I'm a fuckin' cultural Gladiator dude. Fuck!
[cast laughs]
"Murph: Like, he's like realizing it a little bit. And so like still with his cool sword is just, like, dragging it just like,"
"Cody: Yeah, I think there's some fuckin' memories over here or whatever."
Murph: And then just gonna go try to read stuff.
"Brennan: Yeah. Well, you know, your weapon is basically only now these like mythical magical blades. You begin putting back all of the historical weapons in their spot and sitting down and actually looking at the time periods and places that all this stuff came from and begin to see the artistry of all these different weapons, materials. Cody, go ahead and give me a History check with advantage."
Murph: 17.
"Brennan: I think Cody walks away with a lot of appreciation for all these different time periods and the historical reasons that shaped the artistry and the styles and why things were this way. And you begin to see the stories around all of these different kind of like warrior traditions through the past. And I think have a long moment of reckoning with, like, you have been, like, absorbing all of this stuff second and third hand through media, you know what I mean? And you have this giant, like, double weapon on your back. Yeah, I think you probably look at, like, the swords, like all the history of the swords and then being like, yeah, like, these sorts were made to be effective and like a lot of the, you know, like here's some like peasant’s weapons from the time and here's the advance that brought this around and the status and culture afforded to different weapons. A lot of these were like, a lot of the heavy armors were just for aristocrats who were the only people that could afford them. And others are like, oh, like, the reason that this intense steel process had to happen this way was because of the type of iron that was available in this land. And you're seeing too that like, the plethora of different cultures that have these weapons. It's like, oh look at Damascus steel, look at this other kinds of like from all over the world in different places. And I think Cody probably feels like a more centered place with a lot more appreciation for this stuff rather than just like scanning Etsy for whichever weapon has like the most spikes on it."
"Murph: I think this is such like a short amount of time that I think Cody is just like, all this does is make him realize that he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. So, he's just like furiously taking pictures of things to Google later to like read about."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Did anyone else get above a 15 on their check?
Zac: I got a 19.
"Brennan: And Ricky's looking for Perry the Pigeon, right?"
"Zac: Yeah, just curious if there's any info there."
"Brennan: Yeah. You see Perry and see more recent memories. Perry is living in a wonderful coop in Brooklyn. You see that it's like a kind of like Brooklyn-y food co-op, there's like a garden and stuff. But you see that Perry is living in a lovely little home that is protected by the Umbral Arcana, so it looks like a sort of multi-animal. There is a pigeon coop with some like pet pigeons that are being kept. There's a rabbit coop. But around that you see that there's actually, like, a small little village and there's a little wooden hutch where Perry is happily living with a rabbit together. And you see that he's got a little two year sobriety chip next to him. And you see he's got tiny little like acorn mugs. And he and this rabbit are sitting on a little love seat made out of, like, dollhouse material together each reading a newspaper and kind of leaning their heads against each other. The Tiny Animal Gazette."
Ally: Did you say Brooklyn co-op pigeon village?
"Brennan: Yeah, Brooklyn co-op pigeon village."
Ally: Cool cool.
Emily: [laughs] True clowns. Brooklyn co-op pigeon village.
Brennan: Awesome.
"Siobhan: Can I do an investigation check to see if there's, like, a cute little magnet or a bookmark or something that I can bring back to my kids?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. Go for it."
Siobhan: Great. That I also rolled a nat 1. Boy.
Brennan: Oh no!
Ally: Get ‘em out here.
Lou: Get ‘em out.
Siobhan: My rolling today.
Zac: Can I help you guys?
"Brennan: I will say Pete, you're looking for Vox stuff, right? Iga and Sofie. Sofie got a 9. And what did Iga get?"
Siobhan: I also got a 9.
"Brennan: Cool. You're looking for memories of Polish people. You're having a hard time looking at memories because your chest is super charging this wing of the Met. You see that memories are flooding out of the chest into this wing, and you can feel, again whatever is inside the chest is powerfully connected to memory. And you see, actually, I'm gonna let everyone that didn't roll with advantage roll with advantage because of the presence of the chest here."
[Ally whistles]
Siobhan looks up and shakes her head.
Emily: I rolled another 2.
Siobhan: I'm gonna fuckin' use my last luck point. I rolled a 4. I don't know what is happening to me today.
"Brennan: Terrible, terrible."
Emily: I rolled the same exact thing that I did.
Siobhan: Oh there we go. I rolled a 20. There we go.
Brennan: Is that a nat 20 for real?
Siobhan: It is finally a fuckin' nat 20.
Ally: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: Two luck points and advantage.
Murph: Oh my god.
"Brennan: Iga, a bunch of memories are flooding out of the chest. You can see that, like, once again the magic of the chest. You also see that the chest now is existing in two layers. You see the old Polish forest is underneath the city. It's not gone. It looks like the city is molding around it to protect it. That there is like this… It's like developing a double layer of, like, exoskeleton to protect against something that is trying to erase the city and the forest. Something is coming for both. You look, and you can tell that the time is approaching. Like, the secrets in the castle are waiting for Iga. In terms of Polish people in New York, you see tons of them. You see Greenpoint neighborhood, Polish bakeries opening up. I think you also see a powerful magical connection from here to a place. You see that your chest is protecting not only itself but this wing of the museum and a number of other places out there. And as you specifically look for other Polish people that came to New York, you see it's protecting Greenpoint in a very real way, but also you see farther out through window of the Met. You see a couple of museums, a couple of memorials, and places throughout the city that it's protecting. And you see that there is a source of tremendous friction where it looks like the chest is most actively fighting something. You see Ellis Island. And as you think about, like, the Polish people that have come to the city throughout the centuries, you see that something is that the biggest, like, battle front of your chest is over at Ellis Island. For Sofia on that nine, the memories you most want to find of other memories of things that happened like this in the city, you find none. You do find memories of Tony. You do find some memories of young Tony. Tony, young guy. It's the 1980s. He's in his early twenties. See he's got a wedding band on his finger."
Emily: Did he have one when I met him?
"Brennan: No, he did not. You see him showing up looking bleary-eyed, intense, angry, violent. You see him getting arrested for public brawling. And you finally see him. He can't sleep. He's like an intense insomniac. Every time he goes to sleep, he can't find any rest. And he gets to a point of insomnia where he's been awake for so many days that after about three days of being awake he begins to see the Unsleeping City. And you see him find the fire escape above Spaghetti's Bakery and climb up and find the Monastery of the Midnight Sun. You see he quickly becomes obsessed. He burns a house down in Staten Island. And you see crazy pushups, up all night studying the scrolls, quickly becomes the First Fist of the Order. And you see he gets into a screaming fight with Jackson Wei as he's First Fist. Jackson Wei is like two or three years younger than him. But Jackson Wei joins, like, late 80s. Like, late 80s, early 90s around there after Tony's already been at the Order for a couple of years. Jackson is yelling at him about going too far, about like, it's like, “for you it's a vendetta, it's personal, your judgment is blinded.” And around like 1991 or so, Tony gets into a big fight with the then-abbess of the Concrete Fist, with Jackson, with a young Solomon at that point. And there's clearly a lot of camaraderie here. You're seeing the negative moments that you're kind of looking for. But basically, you know, Tony goes like, you know,"
"Tony: You should all fuckin' think about it, all right? You should do this!"
"Brennan: And they go like, you see Jackson going like,"
"Jackson: Tony, what the fuck is the matter with you? Look, we have a job to protect the city. You don't give a shit about the city anymore. Look what you fuckin' did to yourself."
"Brennan: And he points at Tony who is shirtless, and you see that there is a big scar over Tony's heart. And you see that Tony has this confrontation where he says he's gonna move out and start his own order somewhere. It's actually gonna look to get the job done and finish what they started."
"Emily: Do I get a sense of what ""get the job done"" means?"
"Brennan: You see Cindy having a very tearful thing. And after that confrontation, Tony comes and apologizes to everyone and makes amends and is like, ""I'm gonna step down as the First Fist. It's clear that, you know, Jackson is the superior monk to me, and we had this disagreement and it became too quarrelsome."" But basically it's this thing where you see Jackson and Cindy having kind of a tearful conversation where Cindy's like,"
"Cindy: Tony's a good, like, isn't Tony a good guy?"
"Brennan: And Jackson goes,"
"Jackson: I don't know what the fuck 'a good guy' is. Look, we have to be pragmatic. We have to stay rooted in what is real. We all know that Tony has a lot of pain. Pain makes people do some things sometimes that are ill-advised. We protect New York City from beings of the dreaming. That doesn't mean you should go in and change your own body, your own soul, so that you don't dream anymore."
"Brennan: And you see that what Tony did to himself is found something in a scroll somewhere in the monastery, did something some ritual involving a pressure point or some sort of like ritualistic scarring of his own heart tissue. And you see him go out and you remember the name he gave to his order in San Francisco was the Order of the Iron Heart. You—"
Emily: Does it seem as though he chose not to dream because he saw the dreaming as the source of his pain?
"Brennan: Pete, you rolled a 19, right?"
"Ally: Oh no, I re-rolled with advantage. I have a 26."
Brennan: [blows out an impressed breath] There's a third Vox Phantasma.
Ally: I knew it!
"[gentle, rolling dream music]"
Brennan: There's a third Vox-
Ally: Is that the wedding ring?
Brennan: Heather Simos.
[cast gasps]
Emily: What? What!?
"Ally: Yeah, exactly."
Brennan: Heather Simos was Vox Phantasma for three days in the 1980s.
[Siobhan gasps]
"Brennan: Nod chose her. She was a Cindy Lauper, Staten Island, 1980’s, out at the club every night. And Sofia and Pete, you meet up where her and Tony's memories meet. And Tony was not awakened to the Unsleeping City. He was head over heels in love with Heather. Heather was chosen by Nod, and you can see Nod trying to warn her, but Vox Phantasma throughout history have all had problems with chaos and recklessness. Heather was immediately like, ""Who the fuck are you? What the fuck is this?"" And when she looked out to the greater dreaming, she had a spirit of wild impulsive curiosity. Did not, like Pete saw before with Josefina Gatsby, did not have a Kingston Brown, did not have a Ricky Matsui, did not have a Sofia Lee. And she ventured out into the deep, deep dreaming past the shores of the Sixth Borough."
Ally: Can I see the moment that she got? Can I see what happened to her?
"Brennan: Iga, you come through. Pete, the only reason these memories are being returned is because Iga's chest is here. Iga's chest is a more powerful attachment to the past and memory and story than even this museum in the land of dreams. And it is replenishing everything that is here. The three of you now stand and look out and see Heather flying in this 1980s, like, disco light ball, high hair, crazy like purple eyeshadow. The huge bangles. Like,"
Heather: This is fuckin' awesome!
[synth-heavy 80s music]
Sofia: She's beautiful.
Iga: I used to look like that. I can still do it.
Siobhan: I cast-
[Ally laughs]
Siobhan: Disguise Self on myself? So I look like what I looked like in the 80s?
Sofia: Beautiful as well.
"Pete: [appreciatively] Iga, wow."
Iga: You know.
"Brennan: Heather Simos flies out. And Nod, the Gray Orphan, is reaching their hand out to them being like,"
"Nod: Heather, stay within the Sixth Borough! You still have much to learn!"
"Brennan: And you see Heather goes like,"
Heather: It's dreams! Anything's possible! Let's make more!
"Brennan: And starts creating more city out in the deep, goes deeper and deeper, creates a sky of even more stars and purple. Pete, you see very small in the nighttime sky some of the purple begins to fade as a spot grows. A gray spot. And as it approaches and enlarges, it is a silhouette of a figure wearing a suit that approaches. It extends a hand to Heather. Heather goes,"
"Heather: Hi, nice to meet you. I'm the Vox Phantasma. My name's Heather."
Brennan: Reaches a hand out. The hand extends. Does Pete know what an anglerfish is?
"Ally: Yeah, definitely. He's seen ""Finding Nemo."""
[cast laughs]
"Emily: So, that's the little lantern."
"Brennan: What you thought of, Pete, as being this entity, the little silhouette human shape that bleaches out the color behind it. That's just a little lantern of something you cannot see. Heather reaches out a hand and vanishes. She turns around to look at Nod as she's being erased from the feet up, tears bursting and running her mascara. And she says,"
"Heather: Nod, I don't understand! Tell To-"
Brennan: And is gone.
Lou laughs a little and shakes his head.
"Iga: So, we're saying that Tony killed the Nod of San Francisco, right? That seems like it's probably a thing that happened? He's out for revenge, and he's out to kill the monarchs of dream?"
Sofia: I think it could be possible.
Pete: That could be possible.
Sofia: I think that there's a part of me that holds on to a hope that we might find Heather still.
"Iga: Yeah, possibly. But that doesn't stop Tony from being broken by this, you know?"
"Ally: And that's what almost happened to me with the Banishment run in, with the anglerfish."
Brennan: If you had rolled a 19.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah."
Brennan: [seriously] For sure.
"Zac: So, does that mean that we can assume that's exactly what happened to the other two Vox Phantasmas that disappeared?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Pete, on that 26, you see the lives of Josefina and Hans from their time periods. Hans was just the Vox Phantasma for a lot longer before he eventually was like, I want to go on an expedition into the deeper dreaming. I just want to see for myself. He was not reckless about it. Josefina was a little bit sadder. In 1929 she just resigned herself and was like, there is something out there. And it was almost a sense"
"of vertigo from her. She was like, ""I know this thing is out there. Isn't it going to get me eventually?"" And there was just a deep despair, and she had nothing anchoring her anymore. Pete, you see, what led Josefina there was the fact that whatever this thing is, it's outside of Nod, but it is also somehow in the waking world as well. Like, this thing works on people in the same way that dreams work on people even when they're just asleep. And it hit Josefina with isolation, loneliness, a severing from real people and real things, a sense of being adrift in a world she did not understand. Until eventually she just physically came here and left into the deeper dreaming until she was found by this thing."
"Ally: I have a question because I know some people believe that dreams are your brain filtering short-term memory into long-term. Is that something that might be like grounding to people and like combat this sense of like rootlessness and depression and despair? Are they like, do dreams combat this horrible, like, yeah, I don't know."
"Brennan: I think, Pete, give me an Arcana check."
"Ally: Baby, that is a 28."
"Brennan: Pete, I think cracks this. I think Pete goes like, yes, dreams do help fight this but it's almost like people need an attachment to three different things at the same time in order to be able to fight this feeling of isolation. They need the ability to dream and hope and imagine a better future, which is a magic that Pete is intimately familiar with. They need an attachment to the real and, like, the people and communities and the beating heart of the real world, the moment that they are in and a sense of belonging. And you think of Kingston. And you look at Iga's chest and think about memory and think about the past and an idea of reckoning with, but also understanding and knowing the story of where you came from or where the people that you love came from and what has happened in the past."
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: And I think Pete knows that there is a Kingston, that there's a Vox Populi and a Vox Phantasma, but I don't know that, you know that there's not another Vox. You know, that sort of duality."
Ally: There's just a box.
"Brennan: Hey, a box and two Voxes. A Vox on box."
Ally: The box Phantasma.
"Brennan: The box Phantasma, yeah. Yeah, I think Pete feels that other thing though."
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: We're gonna cut from here and your guys' awesome moving through the Hall of Memories. Kingston, you take a long ride out with JJ. You get to the sky train which is the little heavenly train that connects this line to JFK. And you get to a kiosk. JJ's looking around. And you see that there is an angelic attendant looking and being like,"
"Attendant: Oh, hello, Mr. Brown. Are you here to claim your ticket today?"
"Kingston: Oh, no, no, no, no. Me and my friend here are just visiting Alejandro. Meeting him at the Cinnabon."
"Attendant: Oh, understood. Okay, well we will..."
"Brennan: You see that she looks down and goes,"
"Attendant: There's actually, there are two tickets waiting for you here. We, obviously you need a ticket to be able to proceed into the terminal."
Kingston: Yes.
Attendant: Huh? It's a very short flight. Are you and your companion taking a flight from JFK to LaGuardia?
Kingston: [with slight disapproval] I guess so.
"Attendant: Okay, that's a seven minute flight."
[cast laughs]
Brennan: It's like the cheapest ticket Alejandro could buy to like let you get into the terminal.
"Attendant: A direct flight, JFK to LaGuardia."
"Kingston: Didn't even know it existed, but here we are."
"Attendant: Honestly, sir, I did not either."
"Brennan: You and JJ move to the terminal. And so, this is like the airport, and you see up like the pearly gates up above in the clouds and the planes going up there. So, you're kind of in this, like you're on the doorway of Heaven here in the airport. You see tons of people looking around excitedly to fly off to their final resting place. People, you know, meeting other people and saying, hello and hi. And you go to a Cinnabon and you see, waiting there with a big cinnamon bun in front of him and two others waiting is your old friend, Alejandro Ortiz. He gets up. A pair of wings sort of flash off his back. Both angelic but also kind of wizardly. There's sort of abjurative runes that surround them. He goes,"
"Alejandro: Kingston Brown. I knew you would think of me to summon me to help you, my good friend. [goes for a hug]"
"Kingston: Hey, had to bring you out of retirement. I know you still can shake it, all right."
"Alejandro: Right before you summon me, I look at Maria and I say, I'm getting too old for this shit. And it was so cool."
"Kingston: There you go! There you go! I hope you're ready to say it again. You know, that's something I can do on the regular now. So, you probably gonna be back in action sometime soon."
"Alejandro: Kingston, I cannot wait. This will be a true honor to come back. You know it, You look, you look great. Can I say something to you, Kingston? You have a little pep in your step. And I mean that in an arcane way. There's like a little bit of levitation around you."
"Kingston: Oh, well, you know, I'm spending a lot more time with Liz now and things are going well, you know. And I don't know. I'm taking a little bit more time for me. And I think it's paying off in a big way. Also by the way, this is JJ. JJ, this is Alejandro Ortiz. He was the old head of the Gramercy Occult Society before he died."
"Brennan: You see JJ goes,"
"JJ: Oh my God. Alejandro Ortiz, you're legendary. It's an honor. It's an honor to meet you."
"Brennan: Alejandro smiles and goes,"
"Alejandro: Oh, this is young JJ. A pleasure to meet you, JJ. Esther is of course a master wizard. You're in great hands. And I am very glad that she is reaching out to promising young wizards such as yourself. Where is your spellbook?"
"Brennan: JJ sort of waggles his laptop. Alejandro gives Kingston a very knowing look. And he's like,"
Alejandro: Kids these days.
"Kingston: These kids these days, right? I don't know what to say, you know."
"Brennan: He's like,"
"Alejandro: For me, I like the must of an old grimoire. You know a tome that has the smell of, but you know that's—"
"Kingston: It's the same reason I'll never buy an iPad, you know. iPod? Is that what they call it? JJ, is that what they call it? Is it an iPod?"
JJ: Two different products actually. You can get an iPod or an iPad.
"Kingston: See, it's something about holding it, you know? It's just like knowing that the music is right there in your hands, you know?"
"Brennan: Alejandro has JJ take a seat and says,"
Alejandro: But it is an honest pleasure. And I'm glad to know that the society is in good hands.
"Brennan: Alejandro looks at you, Kingston, and goes,"
"Alejandro: Yes, it has been a busy three years since I was unfortunately, my passing. But also I was 92 years old. That's a great run."
Kingston: You did it well. You did it well.
"Alejandro: That's wild. The amount of dangerous situations I found myself in. The occult world I was ensconced in for 70 years. I mean, that's wild. That's a long time."
"Brennan: JJ smiles, and Alejandro looks at you and says,"
"Alejandro: You are growing even more powerful, Kingston. To be able to ask for aid from paradise and to have me appear is quite a feat, my friend."
"Kingston: Yeah. I don't know. It seems like the city is in real trouble right now. And I don't know. I think there's part of me that, I think the city recognizes it. I think we're up against something tremendous. You know, speaking of which, you know, I think there's a lot that we need to be doing. So, you know, as I am so excited to be here and catch up with you, is there something you wanted to talk about?"
"Brennan: Alejandro nods and says,"
"Alejandro: Well, I want, I have a request from a friend who no longer is able to travel in other places as I am to please check in on Sofia. There is much love sent from the other side. He specifically asked not to mention his name for fear of upsetting her, but just for you to look after her and ask after her. Also I wanted to check in with you to ask, I know that you will handle business in the side of the waking world. You of course are speaking on behalf always of the people of New York. However even in paradise were the reverberations of your declaration of war heard. And I want you to know that if there's anything we can do from paradise to aid you, I am still a resource in that way. My eye."
Brennan: Pew. His golden eye appears.
Alejandro: Sees much.
"Brennan: He says,"
Alejandro: What is it you are planning on doing? And maybe there's some way I can help.
"Kingston: Well, I mean, we've come to understand that Gladiator is in some way aware, and it is interacting with this greater force in dream. And I mean, at this point, I think we have a lot of questions with regard to what that thing is, what that entity is. I mean, if there's any illumination you can provide with regard to that, this thing, this deeper dream, I mean is there? Yeah, that would be."
"Brennan: Alejandro looks and says,"
Alejandro: There is much that the Gray Orphan will know that I do not about the nature of this deeper entity.
"Brennan: Alejandro taps his head, pulls out his Juul."
Alejandro: [takes a drag] That’s—
Kingston: You know I hate that.
Alejandro: My lungs are made of light! I cannot get popcorn lung!
"Kingston: It just says something though. It's just a choice that you're making. You know, meditate."
Alejandro: You want me to meditate?
"Kingston: Yes, I want you to meditate."
Alejandro: I'm going to go to paradise where everything is literally perfect and I'm going to meditate.
"Kingston: You know how many gurus are up there that you could be working with? I mean, you could work with the greatest."
"Alejandro: JJ, can you believe this? Can you believe this man to speak to his elders so disrespectfully?"
Kingston: You can probably actually talk to Buddha. You could go find Buddha and learn from him. You have that opportunity.
"Alejandro: I talk to Buddha all the time. Buddha is everywhere! Buddha is completely, we are. Okay, listen."
Kingston: You know.
"Alejandro: I hope you know, okay. Kingston, for you I will put the Juul away, but I will say this, your young friend Pete and Sofia as well and the rest of your companions have their work cut out for them. In the history of New York City it has always been the waking world marching forward and the dream world in this relationship of encroaching, approaching, infesting, et cetera. And not really until we encounter Pete. And he is so heroic to save Nod and join with you. And we have the Vox Populi and Vox Phantasma at the same time. Do we see, no. The denizens of the dreaming are New Yorkers themselves as well. The Concrete Fist was too aggressive. The Gramercy Occult Society we were, I wish when I was still alive I had known more about the Sixth Borough to know, hey, this is not merely a chaotic place of danger. This is a realm. We learned that the gray baby was themselves an ally that helped us defeat the American Dream and reseal it back behind the golden door. We learned all these things three years ago. The dream pushes always on the waking world but now we know better. My advice to you, Kingston Brown, my old friend, from a wizard—"
Alejandro’s golden eye shines.
Alejandro: —is this: Dream can push on the waking world. Maybe it is time for the waking world to push on the dream. The things you do with the real people of New York can push back the tide just as strong as this tide coming from here. This I know.
Kingston: That's not bad. That's pretty good. That's pretty good.
Alejandro: This is why you keep a guy like me around.
"Kingston: I mean, a hundred percent, a hundred percent."
Lou: I give him a big hug. And then I think we just enjoy Cinnabons for a little bit.
Brennan: [laughs] Hell yes!
"Lou: And yeah. Can I get a bunch of little, can I get a big old bag of bits?"
[cast laughs]
"Lou: They travel better, you know?"
"Brennan: These are, by the way, in this sort of sixth borough version of JFK, you know these Cinnabons are next level."
"Lou: I'm assuming it's just like the top, but like three times in a row."
[cast laughs]
Lou: Rather than a full bun.
Siobhan: It's mostly cream cheese frosting.
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Yeah, you see you, JJ, and Alejandro just load up. Alejandro has big bags. He goes back to his flight with a big arm full of Cinnabons and goes,"
"Alejandro: Kingston, good luck out there. And you know if you ever need me, you need only say my name three times and also cast that spell. That's also necessary."
"Kingston: Of course, of course. Yeah, I'm on it. And hey, thank you for your words, Alejandro. I think you're gonna feel us."
"Brennan: He kind of goes,"
Alejandro: Ooh! So ominous in a cool way! Okay.
"Kingston: Yeah, right. Okay."
"Brennan: He walks off. JJ, kind of, as you say that JJ kind of like bobs with a little bit of a strut just being next to you. Like"
"JJ: Yeah, that sounded badass."
"Kingston: Yeah, they gonna feel us. They gonna feel us."
"JJ: ""hey are gonna feel us, yeah."
"Brennan: You guys head out. The group meets back up in Brooklyn underneath this giant cloud, and Pete flies all of you up to Nod's bedside. You see Pizza Rat is still there. He goes,"
Pizza Rat: Hi everybody. Good to see ya. How are y'all doin'?
"Kingston: Hey, pizza rat."
Iga: My son showed me your video. It's very good. Very funny.
"Pizza Rat: Yeah, it's like hey, only in New York. [laughs]"
Iga: Only in New York.
"Pizza Rat: Yeah, a rat with a slice of pizza. Anyways, so."
"Brennan: And Kingston, you see the Gray Orphan getting bedrest. They have one of those old, like, Victorian, like, you know, like, hot water bags or I guess cold water bags with like a little screw cap on it, kind of on their head. Go ahead and give me a Medicine check."
"Lou: Oh, what if I did just so poorly."
Ally: Can I give you the help action?
"Zac: Yeah, can I help?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Lou: Yeah, everyone get in here. That'll be a 23."
"[gentle, soft piano]"
"Brennan: Hell yes. Kingston, you walk up. And Pete, as you give the help action, Pete just conjures up a table of glittering like some plastic gloves, some swabs, a little thing of like different medicine."
Ally: Some PPE.
"Brennan: A little PPE. And you— I'm going to say too, that Iga, you see that, you watch a little like swiff of magic puff out of the chest as Pete is collecting this dream material and become a little IV bag that Kingston is able to put to work right away. And Pete, that shit you said about memories you realize is true. Like, about dream's relationship to memories because you go like, experiences, AKA the present, become memories and stories, AKA the past, which is the raw material you need to imagine the future. And there's this thing of sweeping up Iga's box becomes this like sort of jiggling colorful bag of dream phantasmagoria material. But there is a thing that Pete goes like, yeah, like legends and stories and myths and things like that are kind of the raw grist we use to create the phantasms of dreaming. Like, all of these things exist in this cohesive ecosystem. And as Kingston gets this IV bag as basically like liquid food for Nod, you see Kingston, as you touch Nod's arm they sort of open their jet black eyes and look up and smile at you, and you see reflected in their eyes the dream you had that made you levitate earlier. And it feels purely good to you. Your coat whips up. And Kingston, you feel that you could fly right now."
"Lou: I mean, I think I choose not to 'cause I'm actively inserting things into a child, but I do, like, I hold onto that very tightly and will take it with me probably from this place."
"Brennan: I love that. Nod looks up at all of you and says,"
"Nod: Thank you. Thank you for coming here. Thanks, Pete. Good to see ya. Sorry I got got like that. Thank goodness you came and rescued me, huh? I'm back now."
"Brennan: You see Nod looks down. You see Times Square in the distance. There are now two more Gladiator billboards down there amongst the others. Nod looks up and says,"
Nod: Well I'm finally back and awake. Looks like y'all could use an explanation.
Pete: Please.
"Nod: Okay. There's a lot of other monarchs kind of like me out there. And they're really powerful, but we're kind of the small ones, you know? Because like, so Nuria, they were the the Monarch of the Bay of Slumber and..."
Ricky: Bay?
Sofia: What is that called in the waking world?
Ricky: The Bay Area?
[Brennan laughs]
Sofia: Was it called San Francisco?
"Brennan: Nod, uh… [laughs] Nod nods. Yeah. And they say,"
"Nod: I'm really not gonna try to brag, but of my siblings that, we kind of like people and we kind of like dreamers and we're not really like afraid of the waking world that much. We kind of want to be as close to it as possible. And of my siblings like that, there's sort of a, well, I don't want to brag, but because New Yorkers don't really sleep that much and the city's sort of awake all the time, it's really easy to have our dream realm be very powerful here. And other places are really, really magical but some places are more tied to like a Faerie realm or other places are more tied to Heaven or Hell or other places of myth and legend. But every place still has people that go to sleep. So, there is like a dream version in every place, but some people say that I'm the greatest of them but you know, that's, I don't."
Pete: Brag it up.
Nod: No.
"Kingston: Go ahead, Nod. Go ahead, Nod."
Pete: Brag it up!
"Kingston: Go ahead, Nod!"
"Nod: Okay well, yeah. But New York has a unique relationship to the Dreaming. So, a lot of times I try to send help to my other siblings like Nuria in the Bay of Slumber or others that are around when they're in trouble. We also have older siblings that are way bigger than us. And they don't really depend on dreamers. They're big, and they don't come near the waking world most of the time which is really a good thing. One of our older ones is out there right now. And basically, I went out to help Nuria in person. And I left the sixth borough for a little while and I went out there because the Bay of Slumber was kind of falling apart. It was sort of in a bad way out there but also because there was someone out there that really, really hates me that I feel like I owed something to."
Sofia: Was his name Tony?
Pete: And it was because of Heather?
Brennan: Nod looks up and weeps and weeps and weeps. Jet black tears streaming down their face.
Ally: I hold Nod. I put Nod in the Babybjorn that I brought.
"Brennan: You get a Babybjorn for Nod. Nod goes like,"
Nod: Heather was—
"Emily: The Noddle, the Nod swaddle."
"Ally: Yeah, I noddle swad."
"Brennan: Nod goes,"
"Nod: Heather was so beautiful and strong and wild. And I knew that she… I knew that it was, I just thought with a little more time, I thought if we could get over, get over that first rocky period where she was gonna be learning that she would have been a really wonderful Vox Phantasma. I guess I wasn't fast enough to give all those lessons. And I feel so awful. She wasn't even here long enough for any of her memories to make it into the museum."
Pete: Maybe we saw some of her memories in the museum actually.
"Nod: Really, how?"
Ally: We explain the chest and its power and how Umbra's pushed away.
"Brennan: Nod looks at it and goes,"
Nod: That's what started it.
"Brennan: Nod looks up and says,"
"Nod: So what happened was I went to the Bay of Slumber to help Nuria, which means that I had to travel through the deep dreaming. That's always dangerous to do because some of our older siblings and brothers and sisters, they can find us that way. But I was being really careful. But when I got out there, I saw that the Bay of Slumber has been in a lot of trouble. There had been these monks from the Iron Heart that had really been destroying a lot of the connections to this place. And there was something else that was like working there to help that happen. There were like."
Brennan: And you see that Nod creates this vision of this like-
Emily: Gladiator headquarters?
"Brennan: Gladiator headquarters in Silicon Valley. And a tremendous population of, you see that the unicorn who's with you goes,"
Unicorn: Oh my goodness. There are so many people that everyone's just ignoring.
"Brennan: You see, like, a bad homelessness crisis. And you see that feeling of like pain and isolation, a problem of people just ignoring their neighbors and suffering. And I think Kingston, you see that too, of like people looking, and you see incredibly like rising rent costs. And you see Tony and his monks in the midst of all this fucking Gladiator encroachment, like, fighting the dream realm and like turning their attention to this other thing."
"Emily: But at that point, he's fighting the dream world because of his personal vendetta. Not because he's actively working with Gladiator yet?"
"Brennan: Yeah, looks like it. As the unicorn mentions, like, look at all those people being ignored. Pete, you put it together in your head. This entity out here that Nod was able to keep away for so long, one of the older siblings, was during a time that Kugrash was alive. And while Kugrash was alive, these people were specifically not being, the force that is menacing this place is a force of isolation, erasure, and people feeling unseen, invisible, forgotten. And you realize that this thing has like, whatever was keeping it from seeing the Sixth Borough out there, as these three spirits that Kugrash was tending to and his particular, like, ministry to these people, his particular like helping of these people, was helping to defend the city from this extraplanar threat."
Pete: Because people were feeling seen kind of en masse and... yeah. Whoa.
"Brennan: Yeah, there is a, and Kingston, I think you see that as Pete remarks on it and see that part that Alejandro said about the relationship of the waking world to Dreaming. That the more these people are forgotten, the more that these entities of isolation and separation enter in. You see a fight at Tony's monastery in San Francisco where there are shadows everywhere like Tony said. You see the shadows are Nod and Nuria trying to save the monastery even though it's devoted to destroying them. And Nod says,"
"Nod: We knew it was dangerous to try and help, but even a monastery like Tony's is still magic. And even if they're trying to… Even if Tony hates me it was still in a way his dream."
"Brennan: And you see the thing that cracks Tony's monastery in half and kills the last monks that are there and Tony crawling out of the rubble. You see that as something unseen eroding the very foundations of the monastery, and you just see pure pockets of emptiness. The shadows don't do anything to destroy the building. The shadows are trying to stop it, and pure emptiness and vacuum appears at the heart of the monastery, cracks it open, and it is destroyed. As that happens, Nod flings back, watches every light in the Bay of Slumber go out and escapes, rushing back to the Sixth Borough. And you feel whatever it was that devoured the Bay of Slumber starting at the center of Tony's monastery notice Nod fleeing through deep dreaming and begin to move after them."
Ally: And when this like nothingness cracked the monastery did it look like things were losing their color?
"Brennan: It did, yup."
Ally: Okay.
Emily: And is this nothingness a sibling of Nod?
Brennan: Yeah.
Emily: They've referred to like the older siblings. Is this a sibling that would go after their own sibling?
"Brennan: Nod looks up and goes,"
Nod: [quietly] I don't want to say a name. They don't like it when you give them names. The older ones.
"Brennan: Pete, give me an Arcana check."
Ally: Nat 1. [puts their head in their hands]
Emily: Can I give a help action?
Ally: Tides of Chaos! Tides of Chaos!
"Brennan: Yeah, you can. I think you can give a help action here, Sofia. We can roll with advantage."
Ally: Oh great. There we go. 22.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Pete, you look at Nod. They say,"
"Nod: I'm afraid I know which one found me. It's the oldest one. It's so big because it used to be everything. It existed before time, and time is an insult to it because it doesn't want anything."
Pete: Is it just a void?
"Brennan: On that Arcana, Pete, Nod says that they don't want to give a name to this thing. And you immediately are like, I need to go find a name for this thing. Because a name for this thing is what's gonna help us be able to fight it."
Ally: Totally.
Iga: What if there was a way to turn back? To reach into the past and change some of these moments?
"Brennan: Nod looks at you and says,"
"Nod: Well, the city hasn't had a connection to its past in a long, long time. The last keeper of the past hasn't been around since 1994."
Iga: What happened in 1994?
Ricky: Oh.
Kingston: He passed.
Pete: What happened in 1994?
Kingston: The dragon of Bleecker Street died.
"Brennan: The unicorn looks up and says,"
Unicorn: Are y'all talking about the dragon of Bleecker Street?
Kingston: Yeah.
"Unicorn: That's the spirit that called forth me and the other two. He said he was gonna be gone. But while the dragon is alive, everything is remembered. That's the dragon's purpose in the city, to be the city's living memory, to cherish all the stories of everyone and everything that's come before. And the dragon had to set things up. The dragon created the three of us and said tend to those that are overlooked, tend to those that are forgotten, tend to the people that have no one else to tend to them. And then said there was one more person. They needed a mortal. They needed a human being to look after the city and its people."
Pete: Did they ever find that person?
Kingston: That's me. That's me. It's me.
Pete: I wonder if they ever found someone.
"Kingston: Pete, it's me. It's me."
"Pete: Oh, got it."
"Sofia: It could be Cody. Cody, when were you born?"
Kingston: Okay.
(Emily laughs)
Ricky: Were you born in 1994?
"Kingston: Honestly, Cody, when were you born?"
Emily: I think you were born in 1994.
[Emily and Ally laugh]
Cody: It's all adding up.
Iga: It's 2021 right now. You were born in 1994.
[cast laughs]
"Lou: I like pull the eternal token from like, you know, underneath my sweater. And I'm like,"
"Kingston: Cody, I'm sorry, but unless you have this it's not you."
Ricky: Are you giving it to Cody?
[cast laughs]
"Kingston: No, I'm not making that mistake."
Sofia: Be careful. It might choose Cody.
Kingston: Exactly.
Zac: Ricky just kind of looks away.
"Lou: I'm like, it's pretty tense. My grip on it is real tight. It's not getting away. I don't want any Questing Blade kind of choosing action. Yeah, I tuck it back away."
Zac: That’s very fair.
Sofia: But if we found another keeper of the past—
"Iga: I mean, I do, I don't know about stories. I don't know about keepers of the past, but there's a potential way that I have, that I could maybe turn back one element of time. But it is dangerous and it is risky, and it is a risk for all of us that we would, I don't know."
Siobhan: And I pull out of my coat a different tarot deck than the one that Sofia knows.
"[mysterious, tense music]"
Murph: Yes.
Siobhan: And I just sort of shuffle it a bit.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You feel a tremendous power around this tarot deck. Nod looks at it and says,"
"Nod: Yeah, that makes sense. My oldest sibling is out there and is strengthened every time anything anywhere is isolated or alone or forgotten. Be it people like the people that Kugrash was looking after and the three spirits or whether it's the memories and stories of a place like the dragon of Bleecker Street was looking after. But we don't have Kugrash and we don't have a dragon."
"Brennan: Iga, you're holding the deck there. The chest is glimmering with light, and Nod looks like wide-eyed with understanding of, you know, all of the threat that is now posed there. And Pete, you're holding on to that thing of like, you look out into the Dreaming and feel like you could find a, if you went looking, you could find a name."
Ally: I have a second question for Nod really quickly.
"Pete: Do you, I, okay. So I have kind of a crazy idea, but I've been, I have this, you know, magical teapot with like this, like, it just seems like I have this like herbal tea that very much seems like the antithesis to Cypher energy drink. Is there some way for me to do some sort of thing in Nod, like adding this to like the water supply of New York or somehow start to like combat and get people dreaming again to help?"
"Brennan: I think so. I think that could be a good downtime activity for Pete. That would be a thing that would have to be done probably over a process of, you'd have to figure out some powerful magic to do to make that work."
"Ally: Okay, okay. I'll just stick that in my pipe and smoke it. ...No I won't. Not anymore."
[cast laughs]
"Zac: Ricky's probably gonna talk to the unicorn and ask,"
Ricky: Does it make sense? Should I track down the other two spirits?
"Brennan: You see that yeah, the unicorn says,"
"Unicorn: We were a lot more powerful when Kugrash was here. I think if all three of us were together we might even be able to, I don't know, reach out to him in some way."
Ricky: To Kugrash?
"Unicorn: He's so... he's everywhere now but he's still out there in a way. Yeah, I think all three of us might be able to."
Ricky: Whoa. Okay.
Brennan: Awesome. What do the rest of you do in this moment?
Ally: I'd love to talk to Nod privately if that's possible? And go on a little Babybjorn walk.
Brennan: Cool. Do you take everyone else back down to the ground?
"Ally: Yeah, well what does anyone else want to do? I just want to do that eventually."
"Zac: Yeah, I guess I just track down these other spirits. Feels correct to me."
Brennan: And you would know that those spirits are back in the waking world.
"Zac: Yeah. I mean, does the tarot deck, like, does that feel like something that we would use now or after we figured that other stuff out or in conjunction with that?"
Murph: What does the deck do?
"Iga: So, each of these cards in the Major Arcana is a gift or a curse, and we don't know which. There are a couple of cards in here I think we could help us. But you draw without knowing."
Sofia: Does this sometimes go by the deck of many things?
"Iga: It is similar to a deck of many things, but [stiltedly] some say it was re-skinned."
[cast laughs]
Sofia: Oh.
Cody: Sounds super rad.
Sofia: Interesting.
"Pete: Oh, interesting. I guess I've heard that word before."
Murph: Cody's hands are trembling.
[Siobhan laughs]
"Brennan: Iga, you have the cards in your hand."
"Ricky: Cody, are you okay?"
Iga: Would you like to take a reading?
Cody: I’m gonna- I have to do it. I'm sorry. I'm gonna do it. I have to do it. I have to.
"Emily: Someone has to do it, and I do not feel emotionally there to do it. So yeah, I'm gonna shove Cody forward."
[cast laughs]
"Ally: Yeah. I give Cody the help action to hold the sword in one hand, so that he can pull with the other."
"Cody, trembling a little, shifts the sword to one hand and groans in pain."
"Iga: How many cards would you like to draw, Cody?"
"Murph: Oh, don't make me do this. Umm. Oh my God. Oh, we'll just do..."
(Murph groans)
Murph: I'm gonna— should I roll a d4?
[cast laughs]
Ally: Yes.
"Emily: I think you should, Cody."
Murph: Okay. I would like— I would like—
Cody: I would like three cards please.
Emily: Oh no! Oh!
Zac has his hands over his mouth.
"Iga: The first card I want you to think very strongly, Cody, about what it is you're wanting."
"Ally: Oh, no!"
Iga: The first card is The Lovers. You may cast the Warding Bond spell on a target of your choice without expending a spell slot once during the course of the following year. It's pretty good.
Sofia: Okay.
"Cody: Okay, cool."
"Iga: It's pretty good. Not particularly useful for what we're doing right now, but pretty useful."
Murph: I'm sweating.
Brennan: I'm sweating bullets right now.
"Murph: Oh my God. There's just like, no, like as Murph I want to draw one card, but as, like, you throw a magic deck at Cody unless someone tackles him and says only get one card he has to take a few. [sighs]"
Lou: Nobody tackles Cody. Cody keeps going.
"Iga: I'm very annoyed that you have pulled this card. This card is The Sun. You gain 50,000 hit points, eh, experience points and a wondrous item appears randomly in your hands."
Murph: [pained] Oh my god.
Ricky: What?
[cast laughs]
Ally: Could've been Kingston.
"Brennan: Cody gains 50.000 XP and a wondrous item, which the DM determines randomly, appears in your hands."
Ally: Does it add to the sword?
"Brennan: Yeah, a third blade erupts out of the middle of the sword."
[cast laughs]
Cody clutches his shoulder and groans.
"Ally: It's essentially, like, what do you use in the kitchen?"
Siobhan: Like a mandoline?
"Murph: It just looks like a giant, it's just a giant sword fork."
[cast laughs]
Ally: Katamari.
"Emily: Would 50,000 XP have taken Kingston up to level 17?"
"Zac: I think it's like 80,000."
Emily: Okay.
"Murph: Yeah, I don't even know if it'll get me a level."
"Emily: Okay,"
"Zac: 100,000 til we're 12."
"Iga: Card number three, Cody."
Ally: [whispered] Oh my fucking god.
[Murph laughs]
"Iga: This is the second time I've drawn this in this campaign, is The Tower."
Emily: That's gonna be a bad one.
Iga: And it's not a good one.
"Brennan: I'll read this one, Siobhan. All forms of wealth that you carry or own other than magic items are lost to you."
"Murph, his mouth hanging open, slaps his hands onto his head."
"Brennan: Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. Now it says other than magic items. So, the truth is Cody's life was structured in such a way that this is not too big of a hit."
"Iga: You lost the $235 that was in your checking account. Cody, I'm sorry."
"Cody: Oh my god, and my duster and all of my cool stuff."
Brennan: I will say Cody is-
"Murph: It is personally devastating to Cody because all of his like sword— all of his cosplay stuff and everything, all of his video games! Just all of his stuff is gone. I mean, he's just left with his big stupid sword."
Cody: Oh!
"Iga: Cody, I think this is maybe good for you."
Cody: Fuck!
"Iga: I think it's gonna hurt for a little bit,"
Cody: Oh my god!
Iga: But maybe it's time for a rebranding of Cody.
"Sofia: Yeah, I mean the idea of The Tower, 'cause you know I've pulled it before so I've looked it up. The idea of the Tower is actually a time to re- examine the beliefs that you built your life around. So, it might actually be really nice for you."
Pete: Your foundation isn't sturdy. And so it gives out underneath you.
"Iga: Maybe it is a poetic moment for you, Cody."
Murph: Is Cody just nude?
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: He is full, butt naked."
"Siobhan: It's okay 'cause his sword is so big, it's covering everything."
Lou: Is Cody actually naked?
Brennan: Cody is fully naked.
Ally: Naked with a three pronged sword.
Siobhan: I Minor Illusion him just like a pair of jeans and a T-shirt.
Lou: I give him like an actual coat.
"Cody: Thank you. Thank you, Kingston."
"Brennan: So Cody, you are completely without any belongings. Luckily you're renting an apartment, so you still have a place to live, but you don't have a bed there anymore. All your stuff is gone."
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Moped is magically summoned, so you have a moped still. But you're naked. And you look at the three prongs of Thirsting Blade Dark Excalibur Mega Genesis, which is your, um— [laughs and claps]"
Zac: Mega Genesis!
Murph: Mega Genesis!
"Brennan: But you can cast Warding Bond and you do have a lot of XP. So, that's good."
[cast laughs]
"Murph: Cody deserves all of this, and I'm so glad he didn't get another good card."
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Iga, all that stuff gets sucked into the chest. Like, Cody's belongings all disappear into the chest. And Kingston, give me a Perception check."
Lou: That is a 19.
"Brennan: You observe the chest. All the glittering stuff that went in there, Cody's money, a bunch of posters, video game cartridges, belongings, all got sucked in there. And the magic happens in a way. The last time you saw things carried away on the wind just like that, you were standing on the uptown-bound 4/5 platform, Brooklyn Bridge."
"Lou: Okay. Can I, so is that Perception check, does this magic that's coming from within Iga's box resemble the magic of the dragon of Bleecker Street?"
Brennan: 100%.
"Lou: Okay. I think as like a naked Cody is, like, is, you know, is being tended to, I think I like make contact with Iga or make eye contact with Iga, and I'm like,"
Kingston: Can we step away for a second?
Iga: Yeah.
"Kingston: Now I understand, you know, this box has come into greater play with regard to everything going on than you had ever wanted it to be. But do you truly know what's in the box? Like, in the box?"
"Iga: No, I… For all of the generations of my family, we've always said it's too dangerous. We don't question it. And I think I'm the first one, I mean, I know I'm the first one of them to be questioning it at all. But no, I don't know what it is."
"Kingston: Back in '94, when I, you know, first met and came into what I am now, you know, I met the dragon of Bleecker Street and I dunno something about that moment, your box… I think he's inside of there."
Iga: That is kind of the time that I did come to the city. But you said he died?
"Kingston: I mean, hey, you know, I'm just a guy. I don't know. I just went and hung out with my dead, I just ate a bunch of Cinnabons with my dead friend. So, I mean, death is just a word I use to describe a state. I mean, I don't know if he's not, maybe dead's the wrong word. Gone is maybe a better word. But where he went—"
"Iga: Maybe then it is time. It's time for us. I can't go in there until I've had a sleep. I'm old, I need my rest."
"Kingston: Great. Well then let's get you a sleep, and then I don't know. Let's take a trip."
"Iga: Let's take a trip. And I would like, we should maybe take my daughter as well. It's important for her to see. And she's very curious about it."
Kingston: Cool. Let's do it.
"Brennan: Awesome. Kingston and Iga, you feel a profound sense of, like, the significance of this decision. For the rest of you, you've come here and you've ticked off all your boxes. Pete wants to go have a private walk with Nod. For the rest of you, this was probably the best version of this mission that you guys could have gone on here. You got the information that you need. So, for the rest of you, is there anything left or is it return to the waking world?"
"Emily: I mean, I think the question is, like, do Kingston or Iga tell us about this or?"
"Lou: Oh, 100%. I just didn't want to put pressure on Iga, like, in a group setting to, like, do the box thing. So yeah, I think when we come back, I think I like kind of communicate the, like, that essence and that moment of associating it with the dragon and then a possible plan to go and find him."
"Sofia: Yeah. I mean, I'm down with that because it seems like this, and it also seems like, it seems like Alejandro implied that work we do in the waking world can have an effect on the dreaming world. So, even going up and maybe, you know, obviously doing wonderful things like Helping Hands, but also fucking up Gladiator a little bit."
Kingston: I think that sounds about right.
Ally: Can I do an Arcana check to see if there's something in Iga's deck that would bring someone back to life?
Brennan: Go for it.
"Ally: So, 21."
(Lou laughs)
"Brennan: I think on a 21, you don't think there's anything within Iga's deck that could bring someone back from the dead."
"Ally: Okay, cool."
"Brennan: Cool. So you guys, are you guys going to wait for Pete or head back yourselves while Pete's finishing up business in the dreaming?"
"Emily: I think we'll wait for Pete. We'll give Pete his space, but I think it would be better to all, you know, in case anything went wrong."
"Brennan: Cool. Pete, you're going on a little swaddling walk. You've got Nod in the Noddy swaddy."
Emily: The Noddle.
Ally: Excuse me. The Noddy swaddy?
Lou: The Noddy swaddy.
Ally: I've got Nod in a sex swing. ...Just kidding.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Pete, you're walking along with Nod. Nod is leaning their head into your shoulder."
"Nod: Thanks so much, Pete. You're the best."
Pete: Of course. Yeah. I wanted to ask you about the possibilities of bringing someone back to life.
Nod: People come back to life all the time in dreams.
"Pete: Yeah, definitely."
Nod: Are you asking about dreams or the waking world?
Pete: The waking world.
"Nod: Oh. That's pretty hard I think. I could ask about it. I could try to find out. I mean, if you're talking about bringing someone back to the waking world, I feel like Kingston's probably the best person to ask about what magic's possible there."
Pete: True. Yeah. [sighs] Okay.
Brennan: Give me an Investigation and an Arcana check.
Ally: Investigation. Arcana is 28. Investigation is 17.
Brennan: Holy shit. Your Arcana was 28?
"Ally: Yeah, it was a 19."
"Brennan: You find yourself way downtown in Manhattan near where, like, the courthouse is and a lot of the sort of civic marble buildings swirling around. Snow kicking up. You feel a whisper. Something nearby. With that 28 Arcana, the thing out there past the stars in the deeper dreaming hates names. This thing is trying to erase everything, right? You think finding a name for it will give you, it's very dangerous proposition. Pete feels an opportunity nearby to maybe find a name of what this thing is. But you also know that doing so will be a risk. It will be a provocation. So Pete feels a potential for access to an incredible resource but with a chance of danger."
"Ally: Okay. Can I take the Babybjorn off and ask Nod to just go back to their bed? Like, get some rest."
"Brennan: Nod smiles and says,"
"Nod: Okay, hey, I'm feeling better now. Kingston really healed me. So, I'm pretty tough. You don't have to worry about me."
(Ally laughs)
Ally: That's great. Now get out of here.
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Nod does their little - bwwzzt \- glides off in the mist. You look up and see a bunch of Latin written on one of the civic buildings. The words you see inscribed there are ""Nulla dies umquam memori vos eximet aevo."""
"Siobhan: ""Nobody dies if you remember them?"""
"Brennan: Holy shit, Siobhan. [laughs]"
"Ally: Siobhan, what's up, dude? What's up? You're a fucking archaelogist."
Siobhan: How often do I get to use the fact that I took five years of Latin?
Brennan: Nulla dies umquam memori vos eximet aevo. No day shall erase you from the memory of time.
Zac: What was the thing that the guy said on the train?
"Ally: Yeah, I was thinking about that."
"Siobhan: Oh, I have it written down. “What if anything stays?” No."
"Lou: Yes. Like, “what, if anything, remains.”"
Ally: “No day shall erase you from the memory of time.” Yeah.
"Brennan: Pete, go ahead and give me a History check."
Ally: Okay. Okay. That is an 18.
"Brennan: Cool. You, actually using memory of some of the Voxes before you that spoke Latin, know what this means. “No day shall erase you from the memory of time.” I'm going to need a Charisma saving throw."
Zac: Is Pete near us or no?
Brennan: Pete's gone on a little bit of a walk.
"Ally: Okay, that is a 24."
"Brennan: Pete, you begin to see the words fade and the stone goes smooth. Going from the back towards the front. So, ""aevo"" disappears, ""eximet,"" ""vos,"" ""memori."" Moving along. You watched these words being erased. What is Pete thinking about watching this act of erasure as this sentence just starts to go away?"
Ally: Can I cast True Sight?
Brennan: You cast True Sight. Right as it's almost done erasing the last word. It has erased the fifth letter of the first word. Only the first four letters remain.
"Pete: Null, nothing."
"[Brennan yells, imitating an explosion]"
Ally: [startled] Fuck! Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: The stone erupts. Pure void. Cities gone. You see buildings flying up into the sky. Nod turns around, a tentacle of pure invisibility around their throat rips them into the deeper dreaming. You, on a 24, succeed. Off in the distance the rest of you watch the neighborhood that Pete was walking into begin to disappear into the sky."
Siobhan: Fuck.
Emily: I guess we run to try to find Pete.
"Murph: Yeah, I guess we’ll run towards it."
"Sofia: Pete, is this normal? Is this normal?"
"Brennan: Pete, what are you, you watch Nod's face look at you, tears streaming, disappear into the darkness just like you saw in your vision. Give me an Arcana check."
"Ally: Ah, Jesus fucking Christ. Okay, that is a 16."
"Brennan: On a 16, you don't see a thing to fight. You do not see—"
"Ally: Okay, can, Tides of Chaos? Since actually, since I haven't used that yet?"
"Brennan: Sure, go ahead and reroll."
Zac: Gotta get out of here.
"Ally: Ah no! Even less. Okay, 16."
"Brennan: Pete, you are looking around. There is no enemy here, but that word rings in your head. ""Null."" And you feel the provocation. Your True Sight stopped the erasing of this thing. You have a name."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: But you do not see what to fight. This thing, this is like, you're like the most proficient scuba diver in the world, but you're in the water with a fucking Megalodon prehistoric shark, right?"
Ally: I run to my friends.
"Brennan: You guys all are running. You see Pete running away. As he's running, street and building is sailing up behind him into a tear. As emptiness begins to rip open like a giant monster ripping open like using its claws to peel open the walls of a building it's entering. You see it before you, Pete, as you're running. The rest of your friends go here. Right before you, all of you see a little flash of something. There is a moment of like blue light, pink light, a skull, a fragment of spine, blood, musculature. Suddenly two broadswords. Stephen Sondheim appears in front of you. You see, he looks at you, Pete, and says,"
"Sondheim: Not much time left, my friend."
"Brennan: Cuts a hole in reality to the waking world and says,"
Sondheim: Follow me!
"Brennan: And leaps through the hole into the waking world, waving to the rest of you."
Iga: Stephen Sondheim? I'm a big fan.
[cast laughs]
"Sofia: I love ""Into the Woods."""
"Brennan: All of you leap through the portal after Stephen Sondheim. You flash into the waking world, and that's all for this episode of The Unsleeping City."
Ally: Jeez.
"Siobhan: Sondheim's back, baby!"
Lou: Sondheim's back!
Zac: I knew he'd be back.
[cast laughs]

"(The Unsleeping City theme music is here, get ready)"
"Brennan: Hello one and all and welcome to another exciting episode of ""The Unsleeping City"". I'm your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes."
"Brennan: Last we left off, the champions of New York City found themselves in the sixth borough of Nod, deep in the Dreaming, having defeated a number of animated suits of armor and saving the unicorn, one of the three spirits of New York, as observed by the dumpster druid Kugrash three years ago. Our intrepid heroes went their way to various places throughout the sixth borough, including JFK, where Kingston and JJ had a meeting with Alejandro Ortiz, the celestial wizard and former head of the Gramercy Occult Society, with a very meaningful conversation between Kingston and Alejandro there. Sofie and Pete connected in the bathroom over a pregnancy test and an illusory box of Sour Patch Kids, and Pete dumping thousands of dollars worth of cocaine down a toilet with eyeballs who was talking to him."
"Our intrepid heroes made their way deeper into the Metropolitan Museum of Memories, where Ricky saw a connection to Perry the Pigeon, Iga saw a connection to this fantastical Lisowski heirloom chest, while Sofia and Pete connected over the shared memories of Mr. and Mrs. Simos, Tony and his late wife Heather, the immediate predecessor of Pete Conlan, the former Vox Phantasma, back during the 1980s."
"So, having found that information, you guys wended your way to Nod's bedside, where Nod talked to you about other monarchs of Dreaming, including Nuria in the Bay of Slumber, and an older entity, one of the older ones, a deep monarch of Dreaming that Pete discovered, or perhaps created, a name for at the end of last session, called Null. This entity broke through into Dreaming, grabbed Nod, removed them, and began to tear the city asunder before Stephen Sondheim reconstituted himself and opened a portal for all of you to jump back into the waking world, where you find yourselves currently."
"In addition, Cody is butt naked because of doing a true reading from Iga's actual magical ancestral tarot deck, and also had a little time getting in touch with some of the history of medieval arms and armor back at the Met, which was lovely as well. Additionally, Kingston healed Nod prior to their capture by Null, and after the horrifying confrontation with Null, you're all screaming back into the waking world. Again, after having discovered the similarity between the magic of Iga's chest and Kingston and Iga determining that they would travel into the castle at the center of the chest together, and also discovering the relationship of Nod and Nuria to Tony Simos and to the Gladiator headquarters in Silicon Valley. Additionally, we discovered that Ricky had a connection to the three spirits of, the sort of protector spirits of New York City, through his devotion to Kugrash's memory and the fact that he had left his former life as a firefighter to help the homeless, which gave him a connection to Kugrash's original role in the city."
"Our champions are flying through time and space, [whooshing] JJ's with you, you see around you in the sort of wormhole little flashes of these New York minutes around. (mimics explosions)"
Ally: Can I touch one?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it. Give me a, oh, for the True Seeing as well, and touching one of these New York minutes, give me two wild magic surges. This first one is one through four."
Ally: It's a 9.
"Brennan: Now it's 1 through 5, roll again."
Ally: It's a 12.
Brennan: Pete is now on a one through six on wild magic surges.
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: Building up a head of steam, Mr. Conlan. You grab, go ahead and give me Arcana check."
"Ally: Ooh, that is a 17."
"Brennan: You sense— these things are super fucking cool. You don't get a bad vibe off of this natural substance as you touch it. What you get is the idea, it feels like eagerness, excitement, enthusiasm, hustle, go, go, go, go, go. You think of all the parts of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" that go like. (sings exciting part of ""Rhapsody in Blue"") It's the hustle of the city made manifest in a unit of impossibly fast time. This is the part of New York City that becomes intoxicating to some, and to others means, I got to get the hell out of here, this is a pace of living that I truly cannot stand! But for Pete, it's very exciting. This is like a part of the, you realize that this is a huge magical component to the city, is the city's relationship to time. You get a sense that this raw element is incredibly positive. However, it is connected to time itself, and you sense that if these things are moved by raw Umbra, as they appear to be, 'cause there's sort of a naturally occurring Nod-based element in New York, that someone might be able to use it to flatten out time."
Ally: Hmm.
Brennan: And maybe.
Emily: Removes history.
Siobhan: Hmm.
"Brennan: You feel a connection. Null attacked...you basically got away with your first confrontation with Null by rolling that nat 20. This second time, you did not die when they attacked because you made that Charisma-saving throw check. However, finding a name for Null provoked it. What I'm going to ask Pete now is, as you are fleeing from Nod, this entity is closer to you now. Does Pete want to, now that you are fleeing back to the waking world, Pete feels an opportunity to extend a part of himself to further define this thing that draws its power from being unnoticed and indefinable."
Ally: Mm-hm. Yeah.
Brennan: Awesome.
"Ally: I think I hate that we're running away from Nod, who's in trouble, so I think any info that I can get, or any poking that I can do, I would do."
"Brennan: Okay, I'm gonna say that as you can poke and get more information, anything you want to ask about Null as you are retreating from the Sixth Borough, I am going to, Pete is going to have to make that portion of himself vulnerable. So if Pete wants to know about this thing's past, he has to make his past vulnerable. If he wants to know about this thing's, like, identity and like what it truly is, he will have to make that part of himself vulnerable. What does Pete reach out to do, or to understand, about this thing?"
Ally: What does it want?
"Brennan: You reach out with your wants and you see the image of that silhouette (air whooshing) against the indigo skies of Nod. You watch that silhouette convulse in agony and misery, and as it stands, it doesn't look that dissimilar, but you could swear the silhouette in the suit looked a little bit more like it had your proportions. Almost every cosmology, or the vast majority of the understandings of the world, is that the world began in darkness, and most creation myths have some version of emptiness or void being at the beginning of things. There was a time when Null was everything, and what it wants is a return to that state."
Ally: Got it.
Brennan: The existence of its siblings and beyond lessen it in terms of its proportional share of the cosmos.
Ally: Wow. Okay.
"Brennan: You all appear back in the waking world. You are on a busy street downtown, you're like way downtown near Houston, not too far away from like City Hall, where the area would've been. You see Stephen Sondheim twirls the two broadswords, vanishes them, goes,"
"Sondheim: [sighs] That was close. A little bit too close. Glad to see you again, friends, and some new faces here as well. I'm Stephen Sondheim.You may be familiar with my works on Broadway."
"Iga: Yes, you know what I love? Is ""Passions."" I love, it's my favorite. I feel like it's not everybody's favorite, I love it."
Sondheim: It's a deep cut.
"Iga: She's in her tower, he comes to visit, it's so beautiful, the love story."
"Sondheim: Yes, it's always about love. It's always about love, Iga Lisowski."
Brennan: And he disappears.
Iga: How he know my name?
"Sofia: Oh, he's like really, really magical."
"Iga: Oh, I know."
"Cody: See if he had like an undershirt or something, 'cause."
(Siobhan giggles)
"Pete: Oh dude, you're still naked, dude!"
"Brennan: Cody, you see a couple of construction workers whistle."
"Construction Worker: Hey, woo!"
"Sofia: All right, have some respect, have some respect."
"Zac: Are there any of those, like—"
"Emily: You know what, I'm going to march over to those, I'm going to march over to those construction workers."
"Sofia: Excuse me, I'm assuming this is not your normal clothing? You probably change into work attire?"
"Construction Worker: Yeah, that's right, yeah, absolutely."
"Sofia: Yeah, I'm gonna need one of your pairs of clothing, in exchange for that rude way that you just treated my companion."
"Brennan: You see the guy goes,"
Construction Worker: Okay.
"Brennan: And takes his pants and shirt off. He's like,"
"Construction Worker: Does he need the underwear too, or?"
"Sofia: No, he doesn't. He might need to chafe a little to learn."
"Brennan: Cody, you get like a dirty white T-shirt and some kind of like acid washed jeans."
Cody: [quietly] Oh my god.
"Brennan: The guy looks and says,"
"Construction Worker: Hey lady, can I keep my shoes? I'm not off the clock yet."
"Sofia: Yeah, you can keep your shoes. Again, I don't mind if he steps on a couple nails."
"Brennan: There's just a dude with like a hard hat, thick boots, and"
"tighty-whities who's like,"
"Construction Worker: All right, back to work, gang!"
Brennan: Incredible.
"Kingston: Hey, Pete, what was that?"
"Ally: Oh yeah, I think I tell everyone everything, and how I found the name and what it wants and that Nod is in trouble."
"Sofia: But we can't, but you didn't feel us, so we could fight it there."
"Pete: I don't know, it kind of came out of nowhere and took Nod by the neck, and then everything was getting ripped apart. I don't know, Stephen Sondheim really made the choice to bring us back here and I trust him implicitly, so. I followed Stephen through the tear."
"Sofia: Yeah, well, I mean, I think that we've spoken that there's work to be done in the waking world."
Kingston: Yeah.
"Pete: Yeah, I mean, I, yeah."
"Brennan: Pete, you feel that your connection to the dream realm has not weakened or severed in any way. You still feel the magical potential and power here, and in fact are holding onto like a lot of wild magic. And you realize almost that like Nod, wherever they are, is sending power to you. You feel almost like your presence here in the waking world right now is a life raft for a lot of the remaining power of the dream realm. Like you know that Nod invested a fraction of themselves in you, so I don't think, as much as I think Pete didn't want to run away from a fight, the fact that you are here right now means that you still have, that some big important portion of the Sixth Borough got away."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: But I think to that point that Kingston just affirmed, and Sofia, there's a lot of work to be done in the waking world."
Ally: Mm-hm.
"Ricky: Well, I feel like I need to try to track down the rest of Kugrash's spirits. I don't know, what do people feel like they need to do right now? It feels like, yeah, like there's a lot of work to be done on this side."
"Kingston: It feels like stuff, like what you need to do, I think will contribute to like whatever greater thing we're going to face, so it feels like maybe helping you track down these two spirits and then, once Iga gets a good night's rest, us going into the box, feel like the next two bigger things that'll happen before we confront, I don't know, whatever this Null thing is."
"Iga: Yeah, I got to go to Brooklyn anyway, that's where I live, so. Hey, if you guys want to come over for-"
"Ricky: Hey, me too!"
Iga: It's the best borough. No offense to any of the other boroughs.
"Kingston: Wrong, but okay."
Ricky: I live like in a clocktower. We've been there.
Iga: I live in a full house. I am very rich.
(soft laughter)
Sofia: Wow. That's pretty cool. I had a house once.
Iga: A regular family house in Brooklyn means I am very rich.
"Ricky: Well cool, I guess I'm gonna try to like track down that pigeon coop village."
Pete: Co-op?
"Ricky: Co-op, yeah."
Iga: Polyamorous animal house?
Pete: Yeah.
"Sofia: I think if we have the rest, I would love to help you if you want company going into the box, I would love to help. But it sounds like you need a night's rest and stuff, so if that's the case, I have an appointment that I should go to."
Iga: Okay.
Kingston: Okay.
Brennan: Awesome.
"Cody: And Pete, I don't know if your bookstore is hiring or anything, but I don't have, stuff."
Pete: Yeah.
Cody: So...
Pete: We both need to make a lot of money very quickly.
"Sofia: I was actually gonna offer, Pete, that I might reach out to some, I've had some clients in the past, best-paying job is usually when like a real like dark-haired brunette wants to go blonde, and sometimes you talk them out of it, right? Because it just wouldn't look good. But I was thinking that maybe I would hit some of them up and go through with it to try and make some cash for you."
Ricky: [realizing] Oh my god.
Pete: Oh my god.
Ricky: I just realized a way to make some money pretty quick.
Pete: What's that?
"Ricky: It's not New Year's Day yet, right?"
Brennan: No.
"Pete: Yeah, I can't sell drugs though, man."
"Ricky: No, I know. But I think we might be poised for a calendar."
(Emily laughs)
Kingston: This is true.
"Pete: Dude, would you really? Wait, Sofia, what if you told these women that they could go blonde and then be in the Mr. March calendar?"
Sofia: I think they would pay extra.
"Brennan: Okay, the craziest 80’s saxophone comes on, the montage starts."
(all laughing as some sax tunes play)
"Zac: Go back to my Brooklyn loft and, y’know."
Brennan: Yeah.
Ally: I think Pete is just weeping (laughs).
"Ricky: Esther, we're back! Real quick?"
Pete: [strained] Just such a good dude.
"Brennan: Amazing, so all of these are incredible leads to follow. You guys let me know if there's something you guys want to get done that day or like in the case of the chest, the next day, we're gonna cover that next. Otherwise, these sound like a lot of downtime activities, which we've been hurting for for a while anyway."
"Emily: Okay, so—"
Brennan: And a lot of people sound like they want to do stuff over a period of time.
"Emily: Yeah, so is that something with the dyeing a bunch of, turning a bunch of brunette women blonde, is that something that I can do? Like, I don't have to do that today, right?"
"Brennan: No, you don't have to do that today."
Emily: Okay. And I think I'm gonna ask Pete-
"Murph: I have downtime stuff, but no-"
"Emily: I'm gonna ask Pete,"
"Sofia: Pete, can I get Dr. Lugash's number?"
"Pete: Yeah, what's up?"
Sofia: You are literally the only one who knows what's up.
Pete: [realizing] Oh!
Sofia: I need a magical doctor.
"Pete: Yes, yes, definitely. I actually need to see Dr. Lugash really bad, 'cause just pretty much everything I've done would constitute a rebound and that's why I have a sponsor."
"Sofia: Yeah, I was gonna say maybe if Lugash, because I'll be straight with you, I had a actual trigger during all the Heaven stuff."
Pete: Ooh.
"Sofia: And I wouldn't mind, you know, getting checked out physically, and then maybe having a mental conversation with him."
"Pete: Yeah, totally."
Sofia: To set me back straight.
"Pete: Yeah, he is also a licensed therapist. It's really crazy, I don't know how he had time to get all this training, but yeah, he's amazing. He does a lot of EFT tapping."
Sofia: What's that? What's that?
"Pete: Oh, it's just you-"
"Brennan: When Sofia says that she had a trigger, did you roll a nat 1 on one of those dice?"
"Emily: I rolled a 1 on my 10. I just didn't say anything 'cause it just felt, I didn't want to interrupt."
Brennan: So now both Sofia and Pete are at d8s.
Ally: Yay!
Siobhan: Dang.
"Emily: Yeah, but I want to use this time to get, you know. And I will use my downtime to boost it."
Brennan: Boost it. Cool.
Zac: I think Ricky would go to try to find the pigeon today.
"Brennan: Cool, Ricky's gonna go find the pigeon today. Sofia and Pete are gonna go find Dr. Lugash. Kingston, Cody, Iga, are you guys going with Ricky to the pigeon, or?"
"Lou: I'd go with Ricky, if Ricky would have company."
"Siobhan: Yeah, if Ricky wants—"
"Zac: Yeah, sure."
Murph: I think Cody's probably gonna go back to the house and just lay on the floor and think about life for a minute.
"Ally: Oh, I'll give Cody my keys, since he probably doesn't have any right now, and be like,"
"Pete: Help yourself to anything, dude. Any of my clothes are yours, yeah."
"Iga: Cody, my son has sort of outgrown his bed and we were thinking about getting him a full size, so if you maybe want to take his twin bed."
Cody: Thanks.
"Iga: It's maybe a little short, but it's a bed."
"Cody: Yeah, I mean, yeah, that'd be-"
Iga: You'd have to get somebody down to Greenpoint to carry it up to Queens.
"Cody: I'm cool for now, I'm good. I just probably need some clothes, so much appreciated, Pete."
"Pete: For sure, man, yeah."
Cody: Cool.
"Brennan: Cody, you roll back to your spot barefoot. You walk in the door in jeans and a dirty white T-shirt, lugging—"
Murph: What is it called now?
"Brennan: Thirsting Blade, it's Thirsting Blade Dark Excalibur Mega Genesis."
"Murph: Dark Excalibur Mega Genesis, it's a big fork of swords."
Zac is running his hands over his face and through his hair in typical Cody- induced consternation.
"Brennan: It's a giant fork. You walk in, the house is like partially, like, ruined. The door is like blasted off its hinges, and you see that there's Umbral Arcana around. You see that Nasir comes down and goes,"
"Nasir: Cody, we need to have a serious house meeting, man. Those movers you hired,"
Brennan: And you see Nasir's eyes sort of flicker because Nasir's not in
"the Unsleeping City. So he's like,"
"Nasir: Those movers you hired rushed in here without knocking on the door, grabbed all your stuff and literally smashed a bunch of the walls and stuff and dragged it outside, and I'm sorry, but that is your deposit. That is gonna come out of your deposit."
"Cody: Yeah, no, that makes sense, that's fair."
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: Nasir looks shocked that he's not getting pushback. He goes,"
"Nasir: Cool, okay, cool. Glad you understand. Lars and Brita left out some, like, banana muffins, if you want one, they're in the kitchen."
"Cody: That'd be awesome, thank you."
"Nasir: All right, chill, man, okay, good."
"Cody: [stilted] Cool, bye."
"Brennan: [laughing] Nasir walks away. Your half of the room, a lot of Josh's stuff is destroyed, in whatever Iga's tarot did, you're guessing your bed and all your shit just slammed through the sheet and smashed out the door into the street and flew into the sky."
"Murph: I think I just take the sheet down that, luckily, it was probably technically Josh's sheets that we used to separate the room, and I just wrap myself in it like a sleeping bag."
(all laughing)
"Ally: Cody, no!"
"Murph: I try to hang my, like, all I want to do is hang this awesome sword, but all of my like mounting stuff is gone, and so I just put it up against the wall, and then I just wrap myself in a cocoon. [holds his arms crossed against his chest]"
(loud laughter)
Ally: My bro!
"Brennan: So, so funny."
Ally: Fuck.
"Emily: In the clothing that, in the clothing that I—"
"[gentle, cheerful acoustic guitar music]"
"Brennan: Ricky, Iga and Kingston, you all arrive at a rooftop with, like, a little village of like rooftop gardens and hutches, there's like pigeons and rabbits up here, there's a little thing of chickens, this is like a sort of lovely community co-op garden up on the roof. Kingston, you get like a very positive vibe from this place. This is like a community garden, people coming up here, you know, subsisting for themselves. You see that these things get shared with a lot of people, the eggs from the chickens get shared, and Ricky, you sort of follow over to the edge of this hutch, that again, the Umbral Arcana would make people just see the animals here, but you can see that the animals here have actually constructed, these are all like speaking beasts, for lack of a better word, and they have all created a lovely little village for themselves. A little moss-covered balcony has a small sort of like breakfast nook, and you see, you guys have also by the way been up all night, so you guys are like bleary-eyed, it's been a long adventure, but you see Perry the Pigeon sitting at his little tiny pigeon-sized table, and pouring a cup of tea is a little sort of splotched brown and white rabbit who pours the tea, hands it to him, gives him a little kiss."
"Iga: [holding back her familiar] Misiek, no! Misiek, no no, Misiek!"
Misiek squeals.
"Iga: Misiek, no no, Misiek. They're friends."
"Brennan: You see the rabbit looks over, takes out a tiny little air horn, and goes. (air horn blows) And Misiek goes into your bag."
"Iga: I'm sorry, he's a sweet boy."
"Ricky: We're so sorry about that. Kingston, do you have any Cinnabon left?"
"Kingston: Yeah, I got some bites left (laughs). Sir, Perry, I'm not sure you remember us."
"Brennan: Perry looks up and goes,"
"Perry: [high, Mickey Mouse-ey] Oh! Oh my god! It's Ricky Matsui and Kingston Brown! Wow, okay, well, to what do we owe the pleasure? [laughs nervously]"
"Brennan: And you see that the rabbit leans over and says,"
"Rabbit: [distinguished-sounding, slightly nasal] Honey, do you know these people?"
"Brennan: And you see Perry says,"
"Perry: No, well, I knew them, back when I was living in Central Park. Everyone, this is my husband Warren. Warren, this is Kingston Brown, actually the Vox Populi of New York City. This is Ricky Matsui, [behind his hand] a great chest to eat crumbs off of."
Zac: I take some Cinnabon and put it on my chest.
"Perry: Oh, do you mind?"
Ricky: For whoever wants it.
"Brennan: Bunch of pigeons come and be like,"
"Pigeons: Thank you, very kind, appreciate it."
Ricky holds his arms out and seems very happy.
"Iga: This is one of the calendar pictures right here. That's it, we got it."
Brennan: A bunch of pigeons eye Kingston from the time that he shooed them all out of his apartment.
"Lou: Oh, Kingston's having flashbacks to that time. He like takes a full step back from Ricky, and is just like,"
"Kingston: Mm, I don't do, I don't do large crowds of pigeons anymore, I'm sorry."
"Ricky: You don't have to, but it's pretty awesome. Feels kind of interesting."
"Kingston: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure."
"Brennan: You see that Warren looks up and says,"
"Warren: Well, I didn't know that we were going to be having company over. It's a pleasure to meet all of you. How do you all know Perry, my darling husband?"
"Zac: We met Perry a couple years ago at, can I make an Insight check?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Zac: Okay, not too great, 11."
Ricky: We met Perry at a wedding? Going into a wedding?
"Brennan: You see that Perry looks over and says,"
"Perry: Hon, this was the big Confetti wedding. Do you remember when Ronald, my cousin, married Angela Confetti, that pixie, whose dad was in the mob?"
"Brennan: And he says,"
"Warren: Oh, heavens, yes. Oh, that was quite a to-do, yes, yes yes, I do remember that."
"Brennan: You see that Perry says,"
"Perry: Yeah, in any case, what brings you out to a rooftop in Brooklyn?"
"Ricky: I don't know that you have always felt this way, or if this is new for you, but I have taken on sort of Kugrash's mantle so to speak, and I'm searching for the spicy pigeon. Do you know what that means?"
"Brennan: There is a moment of intense silence. I'm gonna need Ricky to roll a Persuasion check for me, if you would be so kind."
"Murph laughs, hands on his head."
Siobhan: Can I give him the help action?
"Brennan: Yes, you can give him the help action."
Siobhan: Maybe it's better coming from Kingston.
"Lou: No, doubly."
Zac: Natural 20.
(all cheering)
"[somber, chiming music]"
"Brennan: You see that Perry looks at you, his eyes go wide, and he goes,"
"Perry: The spicy pigeon, that's… um... Yeah, I've been having some interesting, dreams for a little while."
"Brennan: You see he looks down, he flies back down to the balcony, and Warren is there, and you see Perry says,"
"Perry: Hun, I, uh. Would it be all right if we, if I talked privately?"
"Brennan: And you see Warren goes like,"
"Warren: I completely understand, are you all right? Do you want me to call Marty and try to get him on the phone?"
"Brennan: And you see Perry says,"
"Perry: No, no, I can reach out to Marty later. But if you would like to."
"Brennan: And you see that Warren says,"
"Warren: My darling, I completely understand, I love you with all my heart, I know that you had very strong feelings for this man a long time ago, and it was a very painful loss."
"Brennan: You see he gives him a little kiss on the cheek, Warren goes inside. Perry [fluttering noises] flies up and perches on top of his own little hutch, his house, and he goes,"
"Perry: Yeah, I got into a really bad way after Kugrash sort of at the bagel and disappeared. It was just such a beautiful sacrifice, and I know that Kugrash didn't necessarily return the feelings, I'm not like, you know, I'm like a thinking, feeling person. As an adult, it's your responsibility to manage rejection and find a way to move on, that's part of life. But to know that he was such a beautiful soul and that the chance for anything just… and also those feelings are also always about how you relate to yourself in a lot of ways, and I just wasn't in a healthy place. But I got a lot of help from Marty, and I got better, and you know, in recovery right now, and it works if you work it and you're worth it, so."
Ricky: Seems like you're doing really well here.
Perry: Yeah!
"Kingston: Hell yeah, Perry."
"Perry: Thank you, Warren has, well, I got to be careful because I, no one's ever saved, it's always a process, but I'm happy. Warren makes me really happy, and it's a beautiful life here on the roof."
"Ricky: That's awesome. Well, I can't pretend to know everything about this, but something has drawn me here to you, Perry, and I think you have been chosen in this specific way. Does that resonate with you at all?"
"Brennan: Perry looks down at the side of his hutch, and you see tiny little bags, sort of look like little fairy bags, tied up with like burlap and old scraps of garbage and string, that clearly Perry has tied, and they're little bags of crumbs. You see he goes,"
"Perry: There's a lot of neighborhoods in the city where pigeons have been living for a long time that are, you know, when people like move out of a place, or there's not as many people around as there used to be, most of what we eat is the stuff that people throw away, and if there's no people to throw anything away, then there's no food for the pigeons there. So, I don't know."
Ricky: So you're feeding the pigeons with these little lunches?
"Perry: I'm not a hero, it's what anyone would do."
"Ricky: [nodding] Yeah, wow, that's awesome."
Iga: What a sweet pigeon.
"Perry: [laughs a little] Oh, you're awful nice."
Iga: You're like the Ricky Matsui of pigeons.
"Perry: Whoa, hey, I'm not that ripped, first of all (laughs)."
"Iga: I don't know, I mean, I've seen a lot of pigeons, you seem pretty ripped for a pigeon."
"Perry: Oh, shucks!"
"Ricky: You look like you're in really good shape, honestly."
Perry: Thank you!
"Kingston: Pigeon-wise yeah, top notch."
Ally: “Pigeon-wise!”
"Perry: I mean I've been feeling great. Like after I got sober, I've been feeling really strong and really healthy and, I don't know, I do feel kind of powerful in a way, I guess, but."
"Zac: Hm, can I use Divine Sense or something, just to see if there's—"
Brennan: Perry is radiating celestial light.
Zac: Huh.
"Brennan: You see he has like a suite of paladin abilities. Like he looks almost like class levels in paladin, that he has some sort of powers, but you sense that this spirit has descended in him, but it's maybe a situation where he hasn't tried to use any of them, so he wouldn't know."
"Zac: Okay, I hold up my ax and I say,"
"Ricky: Perry Pidgeon, claim your power as the spicy pigeon. It is time."
Zac: And I just hold my ax aloft.
"Perry: Uh, I'm sorry, claim my power— [suddenly yelling] as the spicy pigeon! [mimics exploding light] Ah! Ah!"
"Brennan: You see Warren runs out, he goes,"
"Warren: Oh my heavens, my darling!"
Brennan: He puts a fire extinguisher on him.
(Perry screams)
"Ricky: Hey, Warren, good looking out."
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: And you see the original aura of the spicy pigeon feels just like in did back in the day when Kugrash would summon it. Perry descends onto the balcony and goes,"
"Perry: Oh my god, oh my god, I have like superpowers. Wow!"
Iga: You're a paladi-geon.
Ricky: Paladi-geon.
"Perry: [laughs] I'm gonna be very honest, this lady has made an incredible first impression on me. I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but there's just something about very like world-wise woman of maturity that just sets all pigeons at ease."
"Iga: Oh, there is so much to learn from pigeons. I love to go to the park. I sit in McCarren Park, I take out my bread, I sit among the birds. It's one of my favorite things to do in the city."
"Perry: I didn't want to guess, but I was like, this woman feeds birds and you can tell."
"Iga: No, I absolutely feed birds."
"Perry: And I was all about it, I'm really all about it. Well shucks, listen, I've been sort of out of the loop for a little while, but you know, [salutes] reporting for duty! Is there a juicy cockroach and a unicorn out there too?"
"Ricky: There's a unicorn, but I was gonna ask you if you know any cockroaches of note."
Zac: I'm assuming he understands that that's like the trifecta now.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ricky: We're dealing with some forces that are beyond what is normally happening here, and we need that trifecta to be unified."
"Perry: Okay, well you know, again, reporting for duty. And what I would say is, well god, I know who you have to go talk to. My sponsor, Marty."
"Kingston: Marty, yeah."
Perry: Yeah.
"Kingston: I thought I recognized the name, yeah, this is one of Kugrash's old friends."
"Perry: Yes, exactly!"
Kingston: Yeah.
"Perry: He's been doing great, he started a monastery."
"Emily, who is not in the scene, immediately stares with huge eyes at Brennan."
"Perry: It's The Monastery of the Sacred Rat, it's up in the Bronx."
Iga: What?
(Emily laughs and claps)
Perry: Yeah!
Iga: Are they looking for a First Fist? Because I know somebody who is available.
"Perry: Honestly, are you serious? Oh my god."
Iga: I'm absolutely serious.
"Perry: Listen, well yeah, it's the Monastery of the Sacred Rat. Fred and Marty started it a couple years ago. They are a diligent monastery that protect the insect folk of New York from aggressors in kind of the tiny world of New York, from all sorts of threats. They're incredibly powerful monks because they've learned to meditate and tap into the power of Kugrash. They draw their power from him."
Kingston: Sounds pretty juicy.
"Perry: Juicy is right! [laughs] Wow! Okay, but I think you'll have a hard time getting there, because of your size, frankly. The monastery's in an old hot dog cart that fell through a sewer grate like 10 years ago."
Emily: This is becoming like a Jim Henson movie and I love it.
Ally: This is so cute!
"Zac: I understand implicitly. I understand all of this and maybe we should head there. It's pretty late now, right?"
"Brennan: It's morning, but you guys have been up all night. You guys absolutely need a long rest."
Ricky: Maybe we check it out first thing tomorrow.
"Perry: Absolutely, but again, I don't think you'll be able to get there at your current size."
"Ricky: Hmm. You don't happen to have a way to, wait, how did we get tiny last time?"
"Kingston: The gnomes, the gnomes in the train station. That's who made us—"
Iga: There are gnomes in the train station?
"Kingston: I didn't love that, but."
"Iga: I should have been more involved, I am kicking myself."
"Kingston: No, no, no, hey."
Iga: There's goddamn tiny gnomes in the train station?
"Kingston: There's a lot. Yeah, they had a big dragon, it's intense, but I guess that's how we got small last time, if we have to do it again."
"Ricky: Yeah, I think I have to, at least. I mean, maybe not everyone has to, but."
"Kingston: Okay, cool."
"Ricky: I think that could be, that's the answer."
"Brennan: Incredible. Perry gives you a big hug, Ricky. He says that he's gonna be reachable. His building shares an old iPhone that's built into the floor on the first floor of their coop, so he gives you the number to text to get the building's iPhone. He says,"
"Perry: All right, take care!"
"Brennan: You all head out to go get some various states of rest and stuff like that. Sofia and Pete. Pete, you arrive at the first place we ever saw Pete in this campaign, a doctor's office near the East River in Greenpoint, by an old warehouse. You walk in, Lugash looks at you and says,"
"Lugash: [Eastern European accent] Oh, Peter, so good to see you, my friend. How are you feeling, you doing okay?"
"Pete: No, that's kind of why I wanted to come by and talk to you. Do you have a minute, or are you?"
"Lugash: Sure, I have a moment."
Brennan: You see he looks at Sofia.
"Lugash: Hello, I am Dr. Primjitzski, pleasure to meet you."
"Sofia: Hi, I've heard wonderful things. I'll give you both a moment, I can talk to you later."
"Lugash: Oh, very well, please."
"Sofia: Do you have a waiting room, or?"
"Lugash: Yes, there is a waiting room outside, one of the couch have a hole in it from a knife fight that broke out in the waiting room, so just get it a little wet sometimes, I would sit on the chair probably."
"Emily: Okay, I go sit on the wet couch."
Pete: It'll be really quick.
"Ally: I shoot you a look that's like, “I am so sorry, this will be fast.”"
"Sofia: No, no, no, of course."
"Pete: Yeah, so I ended up just kind of in a situation again, where, you know, I just… It's just so easy, old habits die hard I would say, and especially when it comes to money and stuff like that, there's just seemingly a pull on me for life, when it comes to drugs. But yeah, so I got a bunch to sell, and then I flushed it all down the toilet, and now I'm in the hole $2,500."
"Brennan: Lugash looks and says,"
"Lugash: Okay, well this is a suboptimal situation. What I would say to you, Peter, is number one, for your health, is we often go back to our habits, when we entering moments of stress. Breaking routine… These things we rely on for familiarity, and especially in moments of stress, we fall back on old habits because these habits, even when they are unhealthy, the part of our brain that is answering to short-term stress, panic, it knows that even if it is bad, it will work for the moment, and when things work for the moment, and you are panicked and stressed, you cannot think about what will work actual long-term for your health. To the best of your ability, I would say to remove these stress factors from your life, but I understand that that is not always a thing one can accomplish."
Pete: Yeah.
"Lugash: What I would ask is, please, tomorrow, the next day, come to meeting with me, I think will be a good idea."
"Pete: I think so too, yeah."
"Lugash: For the money situation, I cannot answer this for you. I do not know how-"
"Pete: Yeah yeah yeah. Actually my friends are pitching in to help out, which honestly just kind of feels worse. You know, just kind of when you're already in a shame spiral and then people are good to you, it almost stings a little bit worse, so. But I took some deep breaths and was ultimately like thankful for my friends and, you know. Hoo, yeah, great. One day at a time (laughs)."
"Lugash: One day at a time is right, Peter. Your friends are taking care of you because they love you and also because they know you would take care of them too. It is never a burden to switch back and forth who is carrying who."
"Pete: Mm-hm. [nods] The word ""burden""."
"Brennan: Yeah, you see he looks and just says, like,"
Lugash: You cannot let it sting you that your friends want to help you.
"Pete: Yeah, man."
"Lugash: There is a big part of your heart that always is telling the story to yourself that you are the only one who's ever going to be on your side. I see it. You are very quick to be independent, you are very quick to say, I can solve this, I don't check in with anybody, I'm going to go out and take care of this myself. And Peter, the heartbreak is, for a long time, you had to be that. You are not wrong to have those instincts."
"Pete: Yeah, that's incredibly true."
"Lugash: It's just not true anymore, and it will take time to retrain those habits, and you must be kind to yourself while you retrain them. It is a blessing for your friends to have you in their life, because you are someone worth taking care of. Everyone is worth taking care of. You are going to be okay, and you should know that what to you feels like it stings because your friends, they want to help you, think of this, Peter. How do you feel when you get to do something heroic for your friends that help them? Does it feel bad?"
Pete: No. It feels good.
Lugash: [pointing] Let your friends feel good too. Selfish not to let your friends help you.
"Pete: Yeah, true. I saw, uh, I follow a therapist on Instagram."
"Lugash: I'm gonna tell you right now, don't do that."
[cast laughs]
Pete: She just posted something really profound.
Lugash: We already know that I feel like Instagram has become what used to be Adderall for you. I have said this already.
"Pete: Yeah, it's true."
"Lugash: Yes, okay, good. I'm glad we make sure. Let me go see the young woman in the waiting room."
Pete: Yeah.
"Brennan: He gives you a big hug, a kiss on the head."
"Lugash: You're going to be all right, Peter. You're a good boy."
Pete: Thank you.
"Brennan: And he says,"
"Lugash: Yes, Ms. Lee, please to come in."
"Sofia: Oh hi, yes, yeah, this couch was very wet."
"Lugash: Ugh, I said the chai— okay."
"Sofia: You honestly undersold it, it's sopping."
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Lugash: So Ms. Lee, pleasure to come, I am doctor for cash, my name is Lugash Primjitzski. What can I do for you?"
"Sofia: Um… I think I'm with, ah, child."
"Lugash: Oh, okay, well this is-"
"Sofia: Sorry, I don't know, sometimes when you talk to a doctor, you say things that you wouldn't say to your friend."
"Lugash: No, I understand."
Sofia: I just kind of panicked.
Lugash: So someone in your situation wants to see a doctor.
Sofia: Yeah.
"Lugash: And I don't want to make any presumption, but-"
"Sofia: I think it's, I have a gynecologist, I love her, but I think that she's not part of The Unsleeping City, and I think this baby isn't part of the waking world, entirely."
"Lugash: Okay, so we check it out. I also don't want to broach this subject, you have said you are with child, and you refer to a baby even though you are not showing. So just because I am a doctor, to make clear what you want me to do, it is your intention to take this pregnancy to term and deliver a child, correct?"
Sofia: Yeah.
"Lugash: Congratulations, from me to you. Beautiful."
"Sofia: Thank you, I think it's a really complicated situation, and I'll get to the place of congratulations, but right now I have like a lot of other thoughts going on, and I'm just trying to take a bird's eye view."
(Ally chuckles)
"Lugash: Very well, that is all right. How many weeks late are you right now?"
Sofia: About two weeks.
"Brennan: Okay, so, he says,"
"Lugash: So right now this will not be a fully-formed fetus, in all likelihood this will be an embryo, yes? So it's limited to what we will be able to do."
"Sofia: Yeah, I guess honestly I should've just Googled at what point you're supposed to go to the doctor, I just-"
"Lugash: No, it's perfectly, for what I can do, it very easy. Again, I also want to say thank you for coming to me. Mostly I pull bullets out of gangsters."
(Emily laughs)
"Lugash: But I want to, you know, it is nice to have an opportunity to prove I am a friend to the heroes of New York. Pete does me a great favor by allowing me to perform top surgery or, as he say, I [makes air quotes] ""shot his tits off."""
"Ally: You just hear from the other room,"
Pete: Ha!
(all laugh)
"Sofia: Between you and me, Pete did me a really great favor today, and I owe him big time."
"Lugash: He's a good, good man, Peter."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Lugash: And by the way, I did not shoot his tits off. Surgery was-"
Sofia: Really?
"Lugash: I fired a gun one time because in the middle of surgery there was a B and E, and a guy broke into my doctor's office."
Emily and Ally laugh. Ally waves their finger.
"Ally: Full sterile, bang!"
(all laughing)
Siobhan: [Iga voice] The gun was put through the sterilization process.
"Sofia: Yeah, I always pictured it so differently, the way that Pete described it."
"Lugash: Peter, he have a way with words, he like to exaggerate. I did not shoot his tits."
Sofia: Okay.
Zac is onscreen with his face fully in his hands.
"Lugash: I shoot man who come from a rival crime family, vendetta, plug him real quick. He looking for information, and then, and honestly, you know what I do right after we administer anesthetic and it needs a minute? I go pull the bullet out of the gangster that I shoot, and I say don't come into my place again, and I send him on his way."
"Sofia: Wow, this sounds like this was a really busy day for you."
"Lugash: Honestly, pretty normal day for my clinic. For my practice, pretty normal. But we gonna take a look at the embryo, your concern again is that there may be something of the supernatural occurring in this pregnancy."
"Sofia: Yes, I just feel as though I must be proactive, because I do not know what's going on. I mean, for all I know, it's three years old in there."
"Lugash: I'm gonna tell you right now, if you were to have effectively a toddler inside your body, and to be the shape you are right now, very unlikely, so just-"
"Sofia: I know, I know, I know, I know."
"Lugash: No, of course."
"Sofia: I also don't know if there's any precedent for this, or if it's dangerous to anyone involved anyways."
"Lugash: Well, I'm going to go up into storage to get the stirrups. You can imagine I'm not performing a gynecological exam super regularly, but I do have the equipment. You are ready for everything in my line of work."
"Brennan: And we're going to do the checkup. He gets a big box of stuff, and the main thing he gets is like ultrasound, stuff like that. And you see that he has some sort of magical stuff here. As he does, you see those dragons tattooed on his arm, on both arms, kind of move a little bit as he's scanning stuff, sort of swim around on his skin."
Sofia: What's with the tattoos?
Lugash: This?
"Sofia: I like 'em. Yeah, but they move, I don't see that every day."
"Lugash: Oh, before I was doctor, I was just full gangster, extremely dangerous magic gangster. I got these when I was living in Moscow, and [considers his forearm] I don't live there anymore, but I still have magic tattoo."
Sofia: Oh. I wouldn't mind a magic tattoo.
"Lugash: Sounds cool to me, right?"
"Brennan: So he looks, he's gonna make a Medicine check. That is a 24. You see he scans, and he says, takes the stethoscope off,"
"[gentle, chiming music]"
"Lugash: Well, Ms. Lee, I am very happy to tell you that it looks like you have a perfectly normal pregnancy which is advancing. The embryo, from what we can tell, is partially suffused with celestial, divine, radiant energy. I'm going to try to say this, as a doctor I always try to advise caution in these moments. The embryo inside you is composed of such a powerful divine substance, even though it is going through mitosis in a perfectly normal way, the cells are splitting and growing, but the, how do I say this, the embryo inside you is completely invincible."
(Emily laughs)
"Sofia: Okay, I was gonna kind of bring that up, because once I had the inclination, I was in a fight and there was a moment where it crossed my mind, do I keep fighting or do I, you know, take a disengage as we call it, and I went for the disengage because of that."
"Lugash: Ah yes, I understand. You are a very danger-prone woman, yes."
Sofia: Yeah.
Lugash: I understand.
"Sofia: In fact, I'm rewarded cosmically by getting into dangerous situations."
"Lugash: 100%, to be very clear, if there were to be a nuclear bomb to go off in New York City, all that would be left would be the cockroaches and your baby."
(Emily laughs)
Sofia: Okay!
"Lugash: I get a number of sort of sonogram tests, we look for a certain amount of radiation. This baby, 100% invincible."
Sofia: (laughing) Okay.
"Lugash: Honestly kind of crazy. If anything, the baby is honestly, not a baby, it's an embryo, but the embryo honestly is making you safer by being in there, so."
Sofia: Okay.
"Lugash: But you know, so that's what's going on at the moment. Probably as a doctor I recommend you stay out of danger just for you and your own safety, but, you know."
"Sofia: Okay, all right, thank you very much, Doctor. This has been very informative. Is there anything I should be eating or drinking to support its brain development?"
"Lugash: Oh, absolutely, I give you a list of prenatal vitamins."
Brennan: You see Lugash goes and starts getting medical stuff together.
"Sofia: And then at what point would I be certain this was gonna happen to the point where I might tell someone, or other people knowing that it was, you know."
"Lugash: Definite yes. Well, for normal embryo it's a period of a couple months after you're aware, to be safe. Some people wait until around the time that they are showing to tell people. Again, this embryo is so potently magical, and again I don't use the word invincible lightly, truly I think if me and embryo got into a fight, embryo wins, is where I am sort of at right now. The way I feel is, I think it is probably safe to, when you feel most ready, you can say to who you like. But you know, I would maybe give yourself some time to think about what all this means, yes?"
"Sofia: Yeah, okay. I guess one last thing,"
"Emily: I take my feet off the stirrups, but I'm still in like the (laughs) little plastic thing they make you wear."
"Sofia: I just, can I have a hug?"
"Lugash: Oh, Ms. Lee, of course!"
Brennan: You see he gives you [mimics hug].
"Sofia: Yeah, I just, it feels like other people do this with someone else, so I just wanted you to be that person."
"Brennan: He smiles. You see he does the math of a partially-celestial pregnancy, and gives you a big, deep hug, and he says,"
"Lugash: I'm going to give you my card, call me anytime, we're going to take care of this pregnancy. Beautiful things in your future, okay?"
Sofia: Thank you.
Lugash: Beautiful things.
"Sofia: I do have a fortune teller, but thank you."
"Brennan: He says,"
Lugash: Madame Anastasia?
"Sofia: Yeah, mm-hm."
"Lugash: Oh, she's great."
"Sofia: Very expensive, very worth it."
"Lugash: Very expensive, very, very worth it. Moves a tremendous amount of money for a lot of the people that I work with, so she's-"
"Sofia: Whoa, okay. [laughs nervously]"
"Lugash: She's great, she's great."
Sofia: Wow.
"Lugash: Yes, 100%."
"Brennan: Lugash smiles, you and Pete take off."
"Ally: I put my arm around her, and then while I was waiting, I ran downstairs to a bodega and bought you a leopard print sweater."
"Emily, wiping a tear, starts laughing."
Siobhan: A bodega sweater?
Ally: That is covered in dust. Absolutely covered in dust.
"Pete: Hey, there you go!"
"Brennan: Pete, as you go to the bodega and get a leopard print sweater, you see that a sparkling, shimmering thing surrounds the bodega, and the sweater gleams with magic, and La Gran Gata, on the cash register of the bodega, smiles at you and says,"
La Gran Gata: Tell my champion that her child will walk always in the steps of La Gran Gata de la tienda de la esquina.
Ally: I give you the sweater and I tell you that.
"Sofia: Thank you, Pete. I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't talked to me today."
"Pete: Same. Absolutely same, yeah."
Pete and Sofia hug.
"Brennan: So much love! So much love here in the space. Incredible, so, everyone heads back to their spots to get some rest for the next day. Pete, you go back to Astoria. Does Sofie go back to her spot with her mom?"
"Emily: Uh, yeah. Yeah, she might go back."
"Pete: You can stay with me and Cody, if you want!"
"Sofia: Mm, maybe I will. I think I'm going to."
Murph’s jaw drops and he puts his hands up to his head. Ally is losing it a little.
"Ally: When we get to the door, I go,"
Pete: Give me five minutes.
"Brennan: And then I'm like,"
"Pete: Cody, we got to clean, now!"
"Cody: Oh fuck, all right!"
Murph: Just look at my absolutely blank room.
"Cody: All right, my room's done."
(Ally laughs)
"Brennan: Peter, you come back down-"
"Pete: Anyway, so, okay, sorry, I just freaked out, 'cause like a real actual adult person was coming in, and I just felt, you know. There were a lot of crumbs! There were a lot of crumbs."
"Sofia: Peter, I live in a studio apartment with my mother in Staten Island, my standards are low."
"Pete: Right, great. So you, me and Cody are all gonna split my bed."
(all laughing)
Ally: We just link arms.
Siobhan: Top and tail.
Murph: I'm just at the bottom like a dog.
"Ally: You insist on having the sword in the bed, too."
"Murph: Yeah, just like trying to clutch it."
Brennan: Amazing.
"Pete: I mean it's a king-size bed. You know, I had a lot of money at one point, so."
"Brennan: Pete and Sofie are snuggled up, Cody's at the foot, La Gran Gata gets into the crook of your arm, Sofie, to sleep with you that night. And you can see sort of like sniffs and whiskers at your tummy, and a little bit of magic (mystic bells chime) covers over it, and then settles down into the crook of your arm."
"Ally: I make us all some like incredible nighttime tea. It's like peppermint, it's got a little tulsi, it's chamomile."
Zac: Do you put your tooth in it?
"Ally: Yeah, I put a little bit of my peppermint tooth in there, stir it around."
"Brennan: Incredible, anybody else do anything that night, before the next day?"
"Siobhan: I think I talk to Jessica and tell her, like,"
"Iga: Tomorrow you're not going to school, you're coming with me."
"Brennan: She goes,"
"Jessica: Okay, you got it, mom."
Iga: Okay?
Jessica: Okay.
Iga: Okay.
"Brennan: She goes, and you can see that she like, the next time you walk by her room, she's laid out like her best pair of boots, a pair of jeans, she's got like the next day's stuff all like ready on a little chair in her room."
Ally: Cute.
"Brennan: That night, Pete. You're in dreams again. The Sixth Borough is"
"cracked apart, but not gone. It is shattered into islands of the former city, floating in void. Manhattan's been cracked apart into like a dozen or more floating things, bits of debris float off into void. You see a little spar of rock that is like the last little bit of Roosevelt Island crumbles. You can see the Night Owl sort of flying away holding Pizza Rat. [flapping noises] Fly off and like hide somewhere else in the city for safety. You see there are a couple places left. Faerie, there's still an island that has Faerie on it. JFK is still out there. You hear a voice speaking. (ominous whooshing)"
"Null: [filtered, almost staticky, whooshing] What did you do to me?"
Pete: Is this Null that I'm talking to?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: No, I say that to Null."
Null: How did you put that thing on me?
"Brennan: And Pete can tell that by thing, Null is referring to the name Null."
"Ally: Oh, whoa. What's… Do you think I can ask it another question?"
"Brennan: Pete, you think you can do anything here right now. You're safer now, because you are the Vox Phantasma, and you are walking here in dreams. You've gotten a handle on this. Your physical body is not here right now. If this thing tried to attack you, you feel like you might be quicker on the draw to just wake up."
"Ally: Okay. I guess I ask,"
Pete: What are you afraid of? Are you afraid of me and my friends?
"Brennan: You turn around and see Null, which is just your silhouette and outline, canceling out the color of the starry sky behind it."
Null: I'm not afraid of anything. What are you afraid of?
Pete: You.
Brennan: Null moves a little bit closer. The silhouette gets a little bit bigger.
"Null: Okay. You know that if I get you, you won't have to be scared anymore. Coming into me is the end of fear."
Pete: I don't believe that. I think coming into you is just letting fear overtake me.
"Brennan: You look down at the city, and see in Times Square, a couple more Gladiator signs (mimics popping sound) light up."
Ally: Okay.
(Null’s ominous whooshing)
"Pete: Fuck, man so you're just the absence of love and wholeness, and you're, what, you're nothingness? But you want something? I don't get your fucking deal, man."
Brennan: You see Null moves a little closer to you.
"Null: I don't want anything. What you see, this is me not wanting anything."
Pete: Where's Nod?
"Ally: Can I have a sense of where Nod might be, and try to get there?"
"Brennan: You get static. (static humming) And Null goes,"
Null: There's no such thing as Nod. And soon there never will have been such a thing as Nod.
Ally: Can I somehow magically teleport to Ellis Island?
"Brennan: You attempt to go towards Ellis Island, and fly in that direction. Null goes to strike. The thing from beyond space and time moves to get you. You're gonna have to wake up. Give me one, you can either give me an Arcana check if you want magical knowledge, you can also give me a Perception or an Investigation if you want material knowledge."
Ally: Oy vey. I guess I want...
"Brennan: And you can do both, too."
"Ally: Yeah, I will do both, I think. Okay, so, Investigation. Wait, was it Perception or Investigation?"
"Brennan: Perception or Investigation, yeah."
"Ally: Okay, that's a 6. Arcana, ooh baby, that's a 22."
"Brennan: 22 for Arcana. You can't see any of the real people in the world, but you see a world where people feel alone. You see a world where people have fewer and fewer connections to the people around them, they have fewer and fewer connections to their own lives, the stories of where they came from and the ideas of where they're going next. You see blank haze, gray fluid [staticky rushing noise] moving throughout, and you see people. You see people that don't look outwardly empty. There's someone walking through like an industrial park to go work at an office job that has the Gladiator logo over it. You see other people moving around, someone doing customer support from their home, some other stuff. You see a person in a corner office in Manhattan looking over Central Park on a phone. You see they laugh, go blank for a moment, and their eyes blank out and are a digital static for a moment, so their eyes suddenly just become television static. So you don't know who any of them are with that Perception, but on the Arcana, you know that Null has worshippers. But because Null prefers to be nameless, these worshippers don't know that they are worshippers. In other words-"
Ally: Are they worshippers or are they prisoners?
"Brennan: Pete probably thinks they're both. But Pete sees that this entity has a way of, I think Pete sees into the relationship between Gladiator and this entity as being one of, and this is a weird phrase to use, but not a devil, but like an anti-god. A god that gets stronger the more you don't know its name and don't think about it."
Ally: Whoa. Okay.
"Brennan: But it is coming after you, so you might need to wake up."
"Ally: Yeah. Ah! I think I'm about to wake up, but right before I do, I think I look in its face-slash-non-face and I'm like,"
"Pete: My friends and I will prevail, and the love and history and positivity of New York City will step you out like a flame, goodbye."
"[dramatic, heroic horn music]"
Ally: And then I wake up.
(Emily laughs)
Brennan: Fucking love it. Pete radiates with phantasmagoric light in that confrontation as you say that. The same roar that went out from Kingston's voice in the waking world roars out from your voice in the dreaming. (mimics roar) And a bunch of sleeping New Yorkers feel the power of their dreams return to them [snaps] as you wake up.
Ally: Cool.
Zac: Ooh.
(Brennan laughs)
Pete: Fuck!
Cody: Whoa!
"Brennan: The team is on it, baby. You guys wake up the next day, and I guess have have the message to all meet up at Grand Central Station, right?"
"Zac: Yeah, I text everyone,"
"Ricky: Hey, can we all go get tiny?"
"Sofia: I don't know what that means, but sure."
Pete: What's up?
"Ricky: I'm just hoping we can all go get tiny again, because I think I found where the juicy cockroach is."
Pete: For sure.
"Zac: I tell Sofia,"
Ricky: I think it's gonna be a cool thing for you.
"Sofia: Uh, okay."
Brennan: Incredible.
Emily: I wonder why Ricky associates me with a cockroach.
[cast laughs]
Siobhan: Are we gonna do this and then investigate the box? Is that our plan? I just want to know if I'm bringing Jessica with me to this or not.
Emily: That works for me.
"Siobhan: Okay, cool."
"Ricky: Yeah, whatever order makes sense. If you wanted to do that first, that makes sense to me, or."
"Iga: No, I think my daughter should come and get tiny with us. I think that she would really get a kick out of it."
"Ricky: I'm wondering what's gonna happen when we get tiny, is what I mean."
Kingston: Are we gonna have to get to the Bronx tiny?
Ricky: Well there's that train.
"Kingston: Oh yeah, they got trains."
"Pete: They got that tiny train, right?"
"Kingston: Yeah, they got that tiny train."
"Iga: Oh my god, they got a tiny train? I got to bring both my kids. I'm sorry, they got to see this tiny train. [to her son] Nicholas, you're not going to school."
"Nick: What's that, mom?"
Iga: We're going on a field trip.
Nick: Woo!
Iga: For cultural reasons.
(Brennan laughs)
"Sofia: Cody, emotionally, do you think you're going to be able to handle it, getting tiny?"
"Cody: I'm absolutely devastated, but I think it's good for me to do things and not just wallow in what my life, I was gonna say has become, but honestly always has been."
"Kingston: Damn, Cody."
Lou’s camera view is so blurry it’s just like the basic shapes of him for a moment.
Zac: Lou may be the blurriest I've ever seen him.
"Lou: [coming into focus again] Sorry, I was just so shook by the depth of Cody."
"Cody: Just doing a lot of thinking. Yeah, cool, yeah, let's go get tiny."
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: You guys go to meet up at Grand Central. Bazathrax talks to from within your chest, Cody, and is like,"
"Bazathrax: Dude, where's your cool-ass coat?"
"Cody: [interrupting] Shut the fuck up, Bazathrax. Shut up, my coat's gone. You were fucking there, dude. You fucking live in my chest. Just stop fucking sleeping all the time, dude. Goddammit. Help me carry this goddamn sword, it's too heavy."
"Bazathrax: Dude, I can't help you with that fucking sword, bro. You're gonna have to get me the fuck out of here."
"Cody: Are you kidding me? Why are you here, then? Why the fuck are you here, dude?"
"Ally: ""You were there"" is so funny."
"Cody: You were fucking there, Bazathrax."
"Ally: He took my coat, you were there."
"Cody: We fucking lost everything. You were there when my coat was gone, man."
Bazathrax: Dude.
Cody: It's been a day!
"Bazathrax: Hey listen, dude, I'm your fucking dark infernal benefactor! Here's what I'm thinking, dude. I think your mistake last time was, you didn't draw enough cards, dude. You got to go back and do another reading and get like five or seven or eight of those bad boys."
"Cody: The last card I took, if I took two I would be fucking fine, dude."
"Bazathrax: Dude, think about it!"
Cody: But I took three!
"Bazathrax: Half the cards are good, and half the cards are bad. So if you draw all the cards, you are guaranteed-"
"Cody: This is nothing! That's just nothing, Bazathrax!"
"Bazathrax: No, dude, fucking shut up! I know math! Fucking listen to me!"
"Cody: You shut up! Fuck you, dude!"
Bazathrax: Shut the fuck up!
Brennan: Cody is screaming fuck you at his chest in the middle of Grand Central.
Emily: I think at this point it's pretty normal. We're used to Cody having one-sided conversations.
"Lou: Yeah, I think we just like keep on strolling."
"Brennan: Jess and Nicholas are a little put off by it, but you guys get to the Whispering Gallery."
"Ally: Oh, I just fill everyone in on the weird dream. Any new info about this. It feels like we're just, like, up to our neck in clues, but I don't, like the mechanics haven't quite snapped in, where I really know what to do or like, yeah."
"Sofia: I mean honestly, it sounds like you fucking wrecked that creature's day."
"Pete: [shrugs] Fucking Null is fucking nothing, dude."
Kingston: Heyyyyy.
Pete: I'm valid. I'm full.
Cody: You threw a metaphorical fucking Big Gulp right in its face.
"Pete: That's fucking right, dude! I wish you were there!"
"Cody: [not speaking in his normal gruff affect] Yeah, would've been awesome. I probably fucked it up."
Ally: I give you the help action to make your sword a little bit lighter.
"Cody: It's still so fucking heavy, Pete."
Zac: It's like 260 now.
Ally: There's no way for me to help. It's 260!
"Murph: Even with both of us, we're doing an overhead press of like 130 pounds each."
"Brennan: Incredible. You see, yeah, in your head as well, Cody, you hear the Questing Blade being like,"
"Thirsting Blade: [weakly] Sire, I'm so exhausted. What have you done to me? Wha— What have I become?"
"Cody: I don't know, do you have the, ugh. You're so sick is the thing. It's all I've ever wanted. If I asked you to just be fucking normal, would you just be normal, or do I need to undo something?"
Thirsting Blade: I feel like I'm two other swords as well.
"Cody: Yes, you're Thirsting Blade, Dark Excalibur, Mega Genesis."
Thirsting Blade: I'm what? What the fuck am I?
"Cody: I don't fucking know, dude! Do I have to talk to the other fucking guys too? Are there other guys in the other swords?"
"Dark Excalibur: [pompous, growling] Hello, I am Dark Excalibur."
"Cody: Okay, you need to go, dude."
"Dark Excalibur: Oh god, I think I'm gonna shit. Why? I'm a sword! It hurts in here!"
Cody: You have to shit?
"Mega Genesis: [“cool” growling voice] What's up, it's Mega Genesis."
Cody: You're so fucking rad.
Mega Genesis: I'm the bad boy of the triple sword.
"Ricky: Wait, so Dark Excalibur is not the bad boy?"
"Cody: They're all bad, Ricky! Mega Genesis, you sound so sick. You need to just get me out of this. You need to fucking kill Bazathrax."
Mega Genesis: You know if you kill-
"Cody: [pained] And buy me a fucking shirt! Just buy me a black shirt, man! Please! These pants are so big. I'm a size 28 waist."
"Brennan: You all get to the Whispering Gallery. You guys remember the trick of the Whispering Gallery, which is just to go into the corners and ask for one of the clock gnomes to come. The last time that you were here, Misty was the one to do it, but who here walks up?"
Emily: I'll give it a shot.
"Zac: Yeah, does anyone remember..."
"Brennan: Cool, Sofia, you walk up."
Sofia: What did she say again?
"Brennan: I don't know if you remember, it's been three years."
Kingston: You just got to call a name.
Sofia: I got to call a name?
Kingston: Yeah.
"Sofia: Okay, I'll go, Rowan Berry?"
[dramatic music]
Brennan: Give me a Persuasion check.
Pete: [head in his hand] Dude!
"Sofia: Oh wait, that would be bad!"
"Emily: I don't say that, I don't say that."
"Pete: It's okay, I need to apologize."
"Emily: No, no, no, I say-"
"Lou: Can I make a History check? Oh, go ahead."
"Brennan: Oh yeah, make a History check."
Lou: History's 21.
Brennan: You remember the name of the clock gnome that got you the first time was Bilbry.
"Sofia: Push me out of the way, Kingston, push me out of the way and say it."
"Lou: I don't push, but I think I do see Pete with that, and I'm like,"
"Kingston: Maybe, uh, not-"
"Sofia: No, I absolutely, as soon as I said it I realized it was a fucking mistake, please take my place."
"Kingston: It's all good. All good. Hey, Bilbry? Bilbry?"
"Brennan: You guys see in the center of the floor, a little grate, a little smoke. (mimics mechanical sounds) And a tiny little old prospector gnome with a four-wheeled quadcycle where the wheels have little feet on the end of them pops out."
"Bilbry: [older man, kind of rustic-sounding] Well, hello there! If it isn't a fine group of adventurers! Mr. Kingston Brown, it's good to see you again."
"Kingston: Hello, Bilbry, it's been a while."
"Bilbry: Well, it certainly has, that's for sure. Well hello and pleasure. We've been busy, busy, busy, it's been a little while since the last time you all were here. What can the clock gnomes of Grand Central Station do for you?"
"Ricky: We're trying to get to the Bronx, we're trying to go meet a specific juicy cockroach there."
"Bilbry: Oh, get up to the Bronx? Well, you don't need the clock gnomes for that, you can grab the Metro North-"
"Cody: We need to get tiny, we need to get tiny."
"Ricky: We need to get tiny, yeah."
Cody: We need to get so tiny.
"Bilbry: [waving his arms around] You need to get tiny, huh? Well, we can see about that! (cackles)"
"Brennan: You see he puts a bunch of weird runic staves on the ground, makes like a dodecahedron, helix of light."
"Bilbry: All right, next stop, itty bitty-ville!"
"Brennan: And all of you are shrunk down to be about one inch tall as a little hot air balloon descends made out of newspaper with the basket being a box of matches with none of the matches in it. He goes,"
"Bilbry: All aboard! Next stop, the clock gnome workshop! Toot toot!"
"Brennan: You see that Nick and Jessica are each just going, [screaming]. They've been to a magical chest, but they've never been shrunk down before. And you guys pile into the matchbox and sail off, once again seeing the little helixing whirl of biplanes and dirigibles and hot air balloons swirling around the clock kiosk of Grand Central Station, and heading up towards the constellations on top of the giant arched roof."
Lou: How big is Dark Excalibur Mega Genesis?
Ally: I was just gonna ask!
"Lou: I think I assume as we get tiny, Kingston immediately looks over just to see if the sword is more manageable."
"Brennan: The sword is proportionally 100% the same, and Cody is really struggling."
"Cody: Still super heavy, Kingston."
"Kingston: Damn, hey, I was hoping for you."
"Cody: I don't even have a cool duster anymore, so what does it even matter?"
Siobhan: I conjure my Mage Hand to help him lift five pounds' worth of the sword.
"Cody: [sadly] Thanks, I think we need three or four people."
"Sofia: I also have Mage Hand, but I think that my body will help it better."
Zac: Ricky's on like the exact opposite end of the hot air balloon.
Emily: [laughs] As is his right.
"Brennan: As is his right. You guys fly through here, you remember the last time you came through here, Pete leapt off of here onto a giant oyster in the food court and shot a dog with a gun but didn't hurt the dog 'cause the dog was the size of a fucking building."
"Ally: Yeah, definitely, yeah, for sure."
Brennan: And then a dirty eagle came and rescued you.
Ricky: This was one of the last times I had a cheat day.
"Iga: The last, three years ago?"
Cody: Three years ago?
Ricky: Yeah.
Pete: You know-
Sofia: You're due for another!
"Pete: People at meetings call this a spiral moment. You know, a lot of people think of spirals-"
Ricky: A cheat day?
"Pete: No! No, just when you encounter a place that you were in a very different place and you get to see your growth side by side. People think spirals go down, but some spirals go up, and you get to look at a past. [spirals his fingers around each other]"
"Iga: A virtuous cycle, a virtuous cycle."
"Sofia: I have a lot of strange memories from the Staten Island Ferry, so."
"Pete: Yeah, some spirals hit more often."
Brennan: All of you head towards-
Ally: [jokingly] I jump out of the air balloon.
Brennan: You see that the aircraft heads towards a sudden roiling tempest that coagulates in the roof of the arch. Let me get a Dexterity saving throw from everybody.
"Murph: I automatically get disadvantage because of the Thirsting Blade, Dark Excalibur, Mega Genesis. I don't auto-fail, do I? I think I just have disadvantage."
Brennan: You have disadvantage.
Emily: Does anyone have any auras that help us?
"Zac: If it's a saving throw, you get a plus four if you’re within ten feet of me."
"Emily: Sweet, I get 19."
Brennan: Cool.
Luu: 15.
Siobhan: 18.
Ally: 9.
"Murph: I rolled an 11 and a 12, so I still got a 17."
Zac: 18.
"Brennan: 18, what did Iga get?"
Siobhan: 18.
Brennan: And what did Pete get?
Ally: 9.
Brennan: Even with the bonus?
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Incredible. Pete, as you make the joke, you fall out of the aircraft again."
Murph: Oh my God!
"Emily: Wait, would Mage Hand, would Mage Hand, though, still work with five pounds?"
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, five pounds!"
"Emily: Can I do Mage Hand, but like, Pete’s probably only five pounds?"
"Brennan: I'm gonna say yeah, you reach out and Mage Hand Pete back up into the air."
Pete: What if I jumped out? Ah!
"Murph: Yeah, you were like leaning over the side being like, oh, right, ah!"
"Zac: “I’m kidding, I’m kidding.”"
"Brennan: Suddenly you guys appear in the workshop. You see the large dragon trains as they stretch off in all directions. Iga, did Misiek come with you as well?"
"Siobhan: For sure, yeah, Misiek is always with me."
"Brennan: So you go around, you start walking through and see these polished, incredible, beautiful, old-school trains and at the heads of them, these like shaped metal sort of like lion-like dragon heads with horns. And again, these aren't enormous, but they're enormous to you right now, and you realize these are probably just the size of like model trains. They're itty bitty. Bilbry says,"
"Bilbry: Well welcome back, happy to help you get tiny. If you're looking for a ride north, you can hop into one of the dragon trains as well."
"Brennan: Iga, you see that the dragon trains, as you get towards the heads, sniff the air, rear up and perform this elaborate bow to you. (slurps loudly)"
"Siobhan: Oh, I do an awkward curtsy."
"Brennan: A bunch of gnomes come out of this giant cuckoo clock, tick-tocking sort of temple. You see lots of other clockwork gear and springs. It's like a little steampunk model train village in the rafters of Grand Central Station, and all these little spring-loaded and otherwise gear-encrusted gnomes come out. High Priestess Hib-Hob comes out and goes,"
"Hib-Hob: Oh, my my my. Well, hello one and all. Oh, the dragon trains!"
Brennan: And everyone looks at Iga being bowed to by these trains.
"Ricky: Iga, have you met these trains before?"
"Iga: N-no, is this not normal? They're not bowing to people normally?"
Ricky: I think they're not bowing to any of us.
Kingston: No.
"Iga: Okay, hello trains. How are you?"
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me a Persuasion check with advantage, if you'd be so kind."
Siobhan: 18.
"Brennan: The trains come up and begin to sort of snuffle at your bag and at your clothes, and again, they're huge, they're like enormous trains, but they are sort of like crowding and a long metallic tongue kind of flicks out, forked like a snake's."
"Iga: What are you looking for? What are you trying to, get out of my bag! What are you doing?"
Brennan: They sort of move back.
Siobhan: I pet them like a really big dog.
"Brennan: They go. (pants) And the trains sort of back up back onto the tracks. Yeah, these little trains would be about the size of Misiek, if you guys were normal size. But you do see that your chest sort of gleams as these dragons approach."
Siobhan: Can I pull the chest out?
"Brennan: You see all of the trains look at the chest wide eyed, and as into you as they were, they look a little bit scared of the chest and back up."
Siobhan: Can I ask them why they're afraid?
"Brennan: Go ahead, if you're using magic or a gift let me know, otherwise-"
Siobhan: I actually speak Draconic now.
"Brennan: Hell yes. Iga, you speak to them in what you think is Polish, because I don't think, Iga doesn't know-"
"Siobhan: Yes, I don't think that she know that, but she does."
"Brennan: Jess and all these people look up. People that are, you guys might think she's still speaking Polish, but anyone that has an ear for languages is like, that's not the same. And the main thing is, you see Jess and Nick both look up at their mom, and you see that the gnomes all kind of gasp as you do this, because they built these. These are not true dragons, much like Misiek is not a true dragon. There's lots of little dragon-like species that are associated with them that are part of the same larger family. These are also built, they're sort of like magical constructs, but they do speak Draconic, and it's clear from the gnomes' expression that they didn't know they could do that. They were handling them just like animals. Centifax, the main dragon train that you guys met three years ago, looks up and says,"
"Centifax: [lower voice, little raspy] Smell, good smell on you. Dragon friend."
"Iga: Yes, Misiek is my little friend."
Centifax: Dragon friend. True dragon friend.
"Iga: Oh, um. [stutters] Mm. I don't know anything about that."
"Brennan: They look at each other. You can see that they have this gift of speech, but are kind of playful, bestial constructs. As wild as it is for them to be both artificial and feral at the same time, that's kind of what they're like. You see that they go,"
"Centifax: Dragon friend, blessed by dragon. Special, magic. Box. Scary box."
"Iga: The box can be scary, yes. It's dangerous, it's powerful."
"Brennan: Centifax leans forward and scooches back and goes,"
Centifax: Dragon trap.
Iga: A dragon trap?
Centifax nods and snorts a little.
Iga: The box is a dragon trap?
"Brennan: You see that another train says,"
"Train: True dragon trap. Powerful. True dragon wise, magic, ancient. Speak from the past, long ago spirits."
"Brennan: Another dragon says,"
"Train: [older-sounding] True dragons cast spells, wear many forms. Palaces of gold and silver. Magic things they collect."
"Brennan: You see another one says,"
Train: True dragons wise and cunning.
Iga: Oh dear. Have we had a dragon trapped in a box for hundreds of years?
"Brennan: Jess puts her hand over her mouth and Nick goes,"
Nick: What?
"Iga: He's probably pretty mad at us, right? Do you think he will be convinced that I just didn't know?"
Brennan: The dragon trains have no answer for you. But you do see that your daughter is here and Kingston is here as well.
"Iga: So, we're tiny, right? We're going to cockroach! [raises her hands in clear confusion]"
"Kingston: Oh, okay. What did the trains say?"
Sofia: It didn't sound like Polish.
"Kingston: Oh, okay, it wasn't Polish? I thought maybe the trains spoke Polish."
"Iga: No, for sure it was, why would it not be Polish? I speak English, I speak Polish."
"Brennan: You see Jess looks at you and says,"
"Jessica: Mom, you weren't speaking Polish."
"Iga: What are you talking about? You speak Polish, I speak Polish."
Brennan: She takes a video she took of you on her phone that starts midway through you talking to these dragons.
"Iga: Okay, you're always taking the videos of me for the Tik Tok and it's very— what the hell?"
"Brennan: You see a little picture of Jessica dancing, and it says, TFW when your Polish mom, and like little things are popping up around."
Ricky: The latest challenge.
(all laugh)
"Brennan: Yeah, you see a video of you speaking some ancient, primordial language. Ricky, you vibe off that, when you remember reading that Divine Sense off the chest, that there's something in"
"there that is not divine, infernal, fae, undead, but something ancient and primal, you know what that is now."
Zac: It's draconic?
Brennan: Draconic.
Zac: Wow. Awesome.
"Brennan: There was a plan for Iga and Kingston to go into the box with Jess, which is why Jess is here, 'cause Jess wasn't gonna come with you to the juicy cockroach, so Jess is like ready, looking at you, Iga."
"[gentle, mystical, chiming music]"
"Iga: Are you going to be mad at me if the legacy that we have, it changes before it gets to you?"
"Brennan: She looks and says,"
"Jessica: Maybe that's kind of like everyone's challenge, mom. The world changes, but you also have to hold onto the past, right?"
"Iga: Okay, so you're smart. Okay, good."
Ricky: The legacy changing Tik Tok challenge.
"Iga: Also don't put that video online, please. Don't put me on the internet, it's not funny for me."
"Jessica: Okay, I won't, I won't."
Brennan: So Iga.
Siobhan: Mm-hm.
Brennan: What is it you are going to do?
Siobhan: I mean I do think that it feels weird to go and do another thing before dealing with this thing.
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: For me.
Brennan: You're saying Iga would rather go deal with the juicy cockroach and then do this?
"Siobhan: No, I think for Iga, I think that she’s like, the time has come."
"Brennan: Cool, hell yeah."
"Siobhan: But she's also just got shrunk, I don't know if we're gonna go into-"
"Brennan: Your box is also shrunk, it's an extra-dimensional space, I think you think you'll be okay."
"Siobhan: Okay, cool."
"Iga: Okay, I got to go. I'm so sorry, I got to go deal with this right now. If anybody wants to come with, you can come with. If not, you can just be carrying the box, I trust you, as you're going to the cockroach. Whatever you feel like you want to do."
"Kingston: I'd like to come, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool, I think Iga, you take Jess and Kingston into the chest. Nick asks you, he says,"
"Nick: Mom, do you want me to, like, leave the box with them, or should I take it home? Or I can take the chest with these guys to go see the juicy cockroach."
"Iga: Why don't you do that? That Cody boy, he's not a good influence on you. Ricky, now he's a good boy, you follow him around, you can maybe learn something from him. Cody, not a good boy."
"Brennan: He looks over at Cody, he says,"
"Nick: Yeah, he seems to be really struggling with that."
"Cody: Bazathrax, why aren't you helping me? You're a devil, you can't just help me lift weight? It's a sword! It's three swords!"
"Bazathrax: Let me out of the fucking tattoo and I'll help, okay?"
"Cody: I'm not letting you out of shit, you don't do anything."
"Brennan: You guys, Iga, Kingston and Jess disappear, you guys get onto the train, the dragon train races north. You are on a train track on a pipe running through the subway system, so you're on a tiny train watching the giant trains shoot past you in the real subway as you head north [train horn] towards the Bronx. Kingston, you appear next to Iga on a balcony in a fairytale castle, and while you understand that it is an extra-dimensional space within New York City, what's Kingston feeling in this moment?"
[fantasy-sounding music]
"Lou: Oh, pure shock. We're in like a straight-up castle and there's just miles of forest?"
"Brennan: A lot of forest, that's right."
"Lou: Yeah, I think there was an excitement around possibly seeing the dragon again, but I think it's now just like an overwhelming sense of, what is this thing that was just in New York this whole time? I think there's just a lot of awe."
"Iga: Yes, I mean, whatever this is, I don't think it can be the same dragon. Like I've been thinking about it, and sure I came here about the time that your dragon disappeared, but this power has been in this box for hundreds of years. I mean, unless there's two dragons in here, but that seems crazy to me."
"Kingston: That's all right, let's not get-"
Iga: Let's not think too much about it.
Kingston: Multiple dragons in one box? I mean.
Iga: Multiple dragons.
"Kingston: It's a box of dragon. I don't know dragon math, but I'm assuming it can't be more than one dragon per box."
"Iga: [stutters] Bluh, uh. You want some tea, maybe something stronger?"
"Kingston: Yeah, yeah, yeah, why not."
Iga: I've got some vodka and some peach schnapps. Put a little drop of the peach schnapps in the tea.
"Kingston: I mean, not too much, 'cause, you know, it is still a work day, and I guess at some point our friends are outside of this, dealing with-"
"Iga: No, just for strength."
"Kingston: Yes, for strength, for strength, I like that."
"Brennan: You grab the schnapps. Jess goes to look in the fridge, and you hear her going,"
Jessica: Where are the borscht bites?
"Brennan: She goes,"
"Jessica: Oh, there they are."
Brennan: And takes a plate of borscht bites out and pops one in her mouth.
"Iga: See, you like them. You like them when you're alone."
Jessica: Yeah.
Iga: Just not when you're with your tiny friends.
"Jessica: I don't know, my-"
Iga: Your Sophies and your other Jessicas.
"Jessica: Look, Jessica F and Jessica K are my friends, okay? There's a lot of Jessicas at the school, and I'm not-"
"Iga: Yes, because we're all immigrants, and we come here, we'll say, like, what will make my child fit in? Oh, the name Jessica, fantastic, it will work."
"Brennan: She smiles, pops another borscht bite. You have a drink. You are suddenly surrounded by ghostly images of all these women."
Lou: Can I see them?
"Brennan: Yes, Kingston can see them as well."
Iga: Oh boy.
"Brennan: You see an ancient medieval Polish woman looks at you, Iga, and says,"
"Iga’s Ancestor: Iga Lisowski, you have come here with your daughter to the castle and you have here a man who speaks for a city not in Poland but somewhere across a crazy ocean."
"Iga: There are more Polish people in this city than are in a lot of cities in Poland, [waggles her finger] so don't give me this. This is a Polish city."
"Brennan: You see that a lot of them (gasps) gasp, and a few of them like pop out of existence, and you see your mom goes like,"
"Iga’s Mom: Iga, please, I know what is in your mind. You should think very carefully before you go down into the bottom of the castle."
"Iga: What am I thinking carefully about, eh? Tell me what I'm thinking about. That my family trapped a being in here hundreds of years ago and just like, were fine with it?"
"Brennan: You see they look around, the oldest witch looks away, and you see in her eyes the story of a time, medieval period, one of the many times that Poland was like ransacked by Visigoths or something like that, and you see a shape like appearing, and this ancient witch taking this chest, saying an old like charm, and capturing this massive thing in a box. That even that beast, long, long ago in legend, was brought here by some Visigoths, who they got it from, who knows where and who knows what, and she went,"
Iga’s Ancestor: Maybe I could have been more honest about what was in the box.
"Iga: Oh, so you did know what was in the box!"
Iga’s Ancestor: There was a dragon!
"Iga: You said oh, I'm never going to investigate it, because you already knew! You already knew what was in the box!"
Iga’s Ancestor: These things work better when everyone is extremely mean and never talk about how they are feeling.
Iga: You're not supposed to say the extremely mean part out loud!
"Iga’s Ancestor: Well, I did!"
"Brennan: And she vanishes. Just your mom is left, and she goes,"
"Iga’s Mom: Iga, I hope you know what it is you are doing, because it will be a big mistake if is a mistake at all."
"Iga: Yes, sure, okay, it's a big mistake or it's nothing. That's life, I don't know what to tell you."
Brennan: Jess looks-
"Iga: That's what you told me about Oskar, and we're still together! It's happy, we're happy!"
"Iga’s Mom: Well, there is still time for it to go wrong! [vanishing away]"
Iga: Okay.
"Brennan: Jess looks up and is like, has this pride in her eyes. She has never seen you interact with these spirits before. She's like,"
"Jessica: Way to go, mom."
"Iga: I'm sorry you had to see that, I'm sorry."
"Jessica: No, your mom was like a trip."
"Iga: Yes, no, I mean, she, you're a product of your time. She survived a lot of stuff."
"Brennan: Jess nods, and you can see her reevaluating the things about you that bug her in comparison to this ancient, primordial woman that was like talking down to you a moment ago."
"Kingston: Well I guess, do you want to go handle that thing all those ghost women were yelling at you about?"
Iga: Let's do it.
"Siobhan: And I add an extra tot of schnapps into our tea, and I give Jessica a little."
"Iga: Don't tell anybody, in this country they don't like the children drinking. So just don't tell."
Jessica: [drinks] Hoo!
"Iga: You're old enough, it's fine. 12 is old enough."
"Kingston: Damn, okay, okay, let's go. All right, all right. We are not in New York, we are in a weird castle, yeah."
Iga: It's medicinal.
Kingston: Medicinal.
Brennan: You head down into this castle. I would like you guys to make either Investigation or Arcana checks.
(whimsical music)
"Siobhan: Hm, I'm gonna use a luck point."
Lou: That's gonna be a 17 Investigation.
Siobhan: Still not great. A 12 Arcana.
Brennan: Jessica got a 23.
Iga: She's smart. She's a smart kid.
"Brennan: She casts a cantrip that Esther taught her, where she is going around touching books in these libraries as you pass through them, and you can see her touching them (slurps) and instantly having read them as she touches them."
"Emily: Wow, that's a cantrip? Impressive."
Brennan: It's called Scholar's Touch.
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: Reads these books, and then Kingston, with that investigation, you see that these libraries, as you get deeper into the sort of bottom floors of the castle, have all of this ancient fairytale iconography. There's lots of fae stuff here: woods, knights, medieval things, and as you get deeper, there are dragons. Prow of a a viking ship, hanging over a hull, clawed feet on the tables. You see a tapestry of like a young, almost like Merlin figure, but you see that as you're looking at this tapestry, there's a beautiful thing of this like young boy walking, that has an image of like fire in his heart, and you see Jessica being like,"
"Jessica: Wow, all of these are books about dragons, but they're powerful. This is like palaces, divine, almost like demigods or something. They're not like big scaly monsters, they're like spirits."
"Brennan: And she starts sort of going around touching them, she's like,"
"Jessica: We should be really careful, because it says that they can wear other forms, they can look like other things."
"Brennan: And she touches another book out on the table by the tapestry you're looking at, Kingston, and says,"
"Jessica: Yeah, there's even like legends of dragons like changing forms, like, in the egg, or like as babies, and growing up not knowing that they were dragons."
Siobhan frowns sharply.
Brennan: And you see a pair of giant double doors leading to a staircase going down.
Siobhan: I chug my tea.
"Kingston: Yeah, feels like-"
Siobhan: Smash the glass.
(glass cracking)
Lou: Okay! I smash my glass.
Kingston: It seems to be custom.
Iga: It's absolutely not at all.
Siobhan: I Mage Hand it into a little pile.
"Lou: Okay, I'm sorry, I cast Mending on mine."
"Iga: I'm sorry, I just, I needed a moment of release, you know? Sometimes you just need to smash a thing."
"Kingston: Hell yeah, it's a big day."
Iga: You ready?
Kingston: Let's do it.
"[snare-drum heavy, chiming, tense music]"
"Brennan: You walk down the steps into the dungeons of the castle. Kingston, you feel a connection to something down here. None of this has felt like New York, but something down there feels like New York to you. As you move down, you see an iron grate, like a prison gate, and through it, glittering mountains of gold. Swords, halberds, lances, banners, even stone towers from, like, ancient Polish castles, and you see on top of one of the mounds, there is a throne, and seated on the throne, dressed all in green with long flowing red hair, is an incredibly beautiful queen. You see that her crown is made of, like, holly wreaths, and she has long pointed ears, and these poison green glittering eyes, ruby red lips, an enchanting looking woman on top of this pile of gold. And Kingston, you feel behind"
"her, maybe underneath her, buried in the gold, a connection to that New York thing."
"Lou: I, like, lean over to Iga before we get too close, I'm just like,"
"Kingston: I think, I don't know, there's something in here I think is tied to what we're after, but I'm not sure this person is it."
Siobhan: Can I activate my Ghostly Gaze to see what is underneath the gold?
"Brennan: Yeah, as you do that divination, underneath the gold is a clutch of eggs, massive eggs, about this big. I'm gonna describe a crazy, I forgot you had this power, so we're gonna skip to the end of this encounter."
"Siobhan: Oh no, I'm so sorry."
"Brennan: No no no, this is fun. The eggs are, like everything here, Kingston, this is the vibe that was on the Dragon of Bleecker Street. The hoard is beautiful, magical, memories, legends, myths, all the riches of magic itself, and Iga, you see a clutch of eggs, some studded with rubies and they're bright red and fiery, some that are green and everything else like that. The largest of these eggs, and the one that you could swear is almost like moving, you can sense that there's like something in there. This is not an unfertilized egg, in other words. You sense a powerful spiritual presence. That egg is not covered in rubies, and it doesn't look old at all. That egg is beautiful deep, like, granite and marble and brick that is covered in flecks of gold like the sun setting between the streets with colors all over it that you could swear look like beautiful graffiti. There is art, like spray paint art, all over it of music and laughing, people dancing in the streets, and you feel a powerful magical presence coming from that egg."
Siobhan: Can I bow to the woman?
Brennan: So you move through the door into the corridor space.
"Siobhan: Yes, and can I Message the egg?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can Message the egg."
"Siobhan: Can I say,"
Iga: Are you the Dragon of Bleecker Street?
"Brennan: You only get an emotion back. You think whatever's in there is like a baby, and also it feels like it is, right now, it feels like the thing in there is just potential. Like it's almost like, because dragons are spirits, the thing in there right now does not have a flesh body yet, and it won't until it hatches. It's pure spirit, it is just a golden, gleaming soul. Kingston, as you follow Iga in here, you feel a connection to a powerful soul in this room, and you see the woman on top of the throne goes,"
"Woman: [low, growling, accented] Iga Lisowski."
"Iga: Hello, I did not know you were down here, and that is 100% on me. I'm sorry."
"Woman: But Iga Lisowski, I am down here, and I have been for some time."
"Brennan: Jessica leans over to you and points at a word in Polish in one of the books from upstairs, and the word she points to is Smoczamatka and she says,"
Jessica: [whispering] That's her.
"Brennan: And it's a little bit ancient and garbled, but phonetically, this is like dragon mother. You see the woman stands up and moves. As she moves, you see gold in piles far away from her slip and slide as though a form, like, you see she turns into a small bird (mimics bird fluttering) flies over to another perch, and is now seated a little bit closer on a different sort of pile of golden shields, and is back in her form as a woman, smiles again, says,"
"Smoczamatka: What are we going to do about this, Iga Lisowski?"
"Iga: I do not know. I do not not know. I feel that there is a lot of context, honestly, that I am missing, and again, these are questions that I should have asked earlier but I'd spent my entire life being warned not to. So I am sorry I was not here earlier, but I am here now."
"Brennan: Smoczamatka walks towards you. She looks at you, Kingston, and says,"
Smoczamatka: And who are your guests here in the castle that long I have been trapped in?
Kingston: I'm Kingston Brown. I'm from Harlem. It's in New York. I'm a friend of Iga.
"Brennan: As you say Harlem and New York, the top of the gold pile rumbles and you see that egg for the first time, Kingston. A beautiful gold-flecked sidewalk pavement spray-painted awesome-looking, beautiful. It's like a graffiti Easter egg, (rumbles) pops out and rolls down the mountain, and you see Smoczamatka goes,"
"Smoczamatka: No, not you again! (snarls)"
"Brennan: And a towering dragon, this one bright red and venom green. This one is powerfully built, like a thick-shouldered, almost like a hyena, like one of those powerful shoulder predators (snarls). Opens its wings and takes its nose and nudges the egg back up the mound, and says,"
Smoczamatka: Something is wrong with this one! Why?
"Brennan: And turns around and says,"
"Smoczamatka: Listen, we can help each other, Iga Lisowski. I could have killed you the moment you walked into this room. I have killed many that have tread these passageways before. But you are the first to reach out to me and ask rather than take."
"Iga: I'm sorry that I am the first, and again, I am sorry that it took me so long."
Brennan: Go ahead and make a Persuasion check with advantage.
Siobhan: 23.
"Brennan: Smoczamatka lies down, crosses her enormous claws, and goes,"
"Smoczamatka: Well then, what are we going to do?"
"Iga: If I release you from this, are you going to hurt people?"
"Smoczamatka: I cannot see the outside of this chest, but I will tell you this. I did not build this castle. This was built by the chest. Your mothers and mothers going back a long time built this to keep me here."
Iga: And they took you from somebody else who also was keeping you somewhere? What happened to you? Where are you from?
Smoczamatka: (sighs) Deep within-
Iga: What is your story?
"Brennan: On that 23 Persuasion, you see Smoczamatka begins to cry, and shares a story of being a like primeval dragon. You see visions of the Białowieża Forest, this like ancient primeval forest in Poland from long, long ago. This creature was captured by like Visigoths and chained up and used for like battle and then captured eventually by one of your ancestors, who only had seen it as being this dangerous threat, this like wild monster, but the monster had been like captured by this evil king, and this horrifying fairytale of— yes, the dragon being dangerous and terrifying and your ancestors being like, if I can get this thing in a magic chest so it stops burning our villages I'm gonna do that, and then this thing being a thing that should have never been captured in the first place."
Iga: So you were just a baby? You were just a baby and they put you in chains?
Brennan: She weeps.
"Smoczamatka: I did not think a human could understand or care about a dragon. I did not know where the chest was. I did not know what we were doing or why but I long for the forest, I long to return."
"Iga: There aren't that many forests in New York. But there's a couple of parks, maybe."
"Brennan: She smiles and says,"
Smoczamatka: I understand.
"Brennan: She says,"
"Smoczamatka: Perhaps I could live my life happily in a park, but I also know I am a creature of the ancient world. I feel like I have missed so much."
"Brennan: You see Jessica steps forward and says,"
"Jessica: Smoczamatka, in the outside world, I think many dragons have died, or changed, or I don't know how safe it would be, but I think whatever..."
"Brennan: She just looks up at you and says,"
"Jessica: Mom, you do whatever you think is right."
"Brennan: She taps this book and says,"
"Jessica: I want to study this castle as long as I can, but I'm not worried about how I'm gonna get magic. I know I'll be able to get it for myself if I need to."
"Iga: Okay, here is my plan for now. Out there, there is no forest. But in here, there is forest, and you should at least be allowed, this is still a cage for you and I don't feel good about this, but there is a forest here. Would you like to be in the forest? You should not be in this strange cellar."
"Brennan: Iga, you look out and see the solid wall of the dungeon, and you look, this castle is your family's legacy. You think you could command the castle, if you wanted to."
Siobhan: I guess I will open the door and widen the stairs wide enough.
"Brennan: You open the stairs (mimics boom) and mainly break the curse and the wards keeping this dragon here. This ancient fairytale dragon turns into her form, turns (bells chiming) into a bird briefly, flies up, sees the stairs widen, turns back into this dragon, (slurps) moves back up,"
"looks out and, again, weeps openly looking over and you see that the dragon takes wing, and as the dragon flies, the forest extends, farther, farther, farther, everywhere it goes. You see it gets to a place where a mountain rises up and it flies over a town suddenly, with people in it. You see a shooting star in the sky. You've let this thing out, and this magical realm that's been inside this chest expands forever. It goes and goes and goes. A magic that was being bottled so as to contain it is released, and suddenly this realm is coming to life."
(uplifting music)
"Iga: Oh my god, I just, I didn't even know that I could do this. I feel so bad."
Brennan: Jess puts a hand on you.
"Kingston: How were you supposed to know? I mean, you've been told one thing your whole life, and all we know is-"
"Iga: Oh, you're told things your whole life, your whole life that you find out are wrong."
"Kingston: Yeah, but family's special. I mean, when it comes from your community, it's that much deeper."
"Iga: Yeah, you got to unlearn some things, I guess."
Kingston: Yeah.
(Iga exhales loudly)
"Brennan: You see the dragon returns, Smoczamatka returns to the castle, and looks out and says,"
Smoczamatka: This place is a place for me.
"Brennan: It looks at you and says,"
"Smoczamatka: Iga, I am angry, yes, at the years that I lost. But also, I do not mind to live in stories and though your mother's mothers were cruel to me..."
"Brennan: You see Smoczamatka shakes her head and just goes,"
Smoczamatka: I think we should speak to them.
"Brennan: And snaps her fingers and all the ghosts appear in here. You see the dragon proclaims,"
"Smoczamatka: I have been freed by your daughter, Iga Lisowski."
"Brennan: The ghosts all, [gasps]."
"Iga: [pointing aggressively] And don't even give me it! I don't want to hear it, okay?"
"Brennan: You see the dragon looks and says,"
"Smoczamatka: Long ago, I was sealed in here with magic. You sealed me in here to draw your power from me. It is not right that Iga should be without this legacy, because this is the history of your family, Iga. But she has also made right what your family did wrong. So I will be free in this realm here but Iga should not go without magic."
"Brennan: You see that Smoczamatka looks at you, Iga, and says,"
"Smoczamatka: I offer you power as my champion. If you wish to take it, it is yours completely, or..."
"Brennan: She looks and says,"
"Smoczamatka: Maybe you'll work something out with these ghosts, but it is up to you."
"Iga: I would be honored to be your champion. I feel like my debt is not in any way paid to you, and I will do what I can for you. It seems to me that you love stories and I think there are many stories that have been told since you were trapped in here, I'm thinking maybe that is something that you would like?"
"Brennan: She looks and says,"
Smoczamatka: I would love to hear stories.
"Brennan: As she does you guys feel the chest arriving at the destination outside of the chest, Iga, and you hear another rumble and you see that egg, the one egg from downstairs, bounce up the staircase, trying to roll out of the castle. And you see that the dragon goes, Smoczamatka says,"
"Smoczamatka: No, what is with this one egg!"
Brennan: And stops it.
"Iga: I think maybe the egg wants to go on a journey. And sometimes the story comes to you and sometimes you go to the story, you know what I mean?"
"Brennan: You see it that Smoczamatka says,"
"Smoczamatka: No, this egg has been a real troublemaker, I can tell it has been doing stuff to the chest."
Brennan: And you realize that this is the thing that has been changing the outside of the chest.
"Iga: Ah, he's got artistic aspirations. He just wants to be an artist. He's got an artistic spirit. I take home with me, come, let me take the egg for a journey."
"Brennan: You take the egg and again, Kingston, you feel this profound connection to this New York City egg. And Jess looks at you talking about this different child and gets a little misty-eyed herself and you see Smoczamatka looks at you and says,"
"Smoczamatka: Yes, the eggs should go on a journey, that egg is trouble. And dragons, we are spirits. I love my family, but whoever heard of two dragons in the same place? No, dragons need their space."
"Brennan: She smiles, changes back into the form of that (bells chiming) sort of Woodland Empress, gives you a kiss on both cheeks and says,"
"Smoczamatka: To understand the past, to reckon with it, and what has been done wrong, but also to know where you came from, these both go hand in hand. Thank you for releasing me."
"Iga: I know a nice young man who works at the bookshop, and I think I'm maybe going to give him a lot of commission."
"Brennan: [laughs] Smoczamatka smiles and takes off into the forest. Your moms all look and you see your ancient-most mom looks and says,"
"Iga’s Ancestor: Well, I guess I was wrong about the dragon being unreasonable."
Iga: Seems very reasonable considering she's been locked up for 800 years.
(Brennan laughs)
"Iga: 1200\. I don’t know, you’re old. I love you."
"Brennan: Iga, Jess and Kingston, exit from the chest."
Ally: Egg-xit.
"Murph: I thought the same thing, egg-xit."
Brennan: Exit.
"Emily: Nice, nice."
"Ally: We're not happy about it, we're not happy about it, all right."
"Brennan: All exit from the chest and you guys are in a tiny little like subway station on a pipe, all one inch tall. Iga, as you walk out, you now have the egg in your hand but in front of you is the chest. The chest is covered in trees and ancient castles once more, and you see vibrating and humming with magical energy, because even though this egg is no longer protecting it, the carving of a fearsome free dragon on the top is."
"Brennan: Incredible, Iga, Kingston, Jess, as you guys exit the chest, is there any other conversation left?"
"Lou: I think Kingston turns to Iga and is like,"
Kingston: I don't know all your plans for this egg but I'll tell you once that dragon needs a place to stay. I know a pretty good one down near Bleecker Street. Already have a hoard and everything.
Iga: That's good to know. That's good to know. Do you want to hold the egg? Do you want to hold it?
[Emily squeals a little]
Iga: Like a little bit?
(all laughing)
Iga: Be careful with it.
Kingston: Can I just?
"Lou: Yeah, yeah, I take it."
"Brennan: Kingston, you hold this egg. Feels warm, man, warm to the touch and it's crazy because you've been living the wildest life imaginable for almost 30 years now. You've been in The Unsleeping City and the fact that you're holding a powerfully magical egg, that has a being of pure spirit that will one day become a dragon, but is now just pure potential, but you hold it and you're also like, this is a, like a baby. This is like, needs someone to look out for it. It's just in the little egg, and it's already been fighting to save the city and it's just in a little egg."
Kingston: It's going to do great things. This one's going to do great things.
"[Brennan laughs softly, grinning, and claps his hands]"
"Iga: Kingston, would you like to look after the egg?"
Kingston: [laughs nervously]
"Iga: I don't want to put the pressure on you. It's a lot of work, I think. I mean, I don't know. I've never raised a dragon before. I don't know. But, the Vox—"
"Kingston: I mean, I don't, maybe, we maybe it's like well, let's save New York and then we can talk about co-parent situation."
"Iga: Let’s save New York, then talk about it."
Kingston: You seem to have a little bit more-
"Iga: Honestly, I should have asked more questions of the mother, she's maybe like, I don't know, heatmap situation."
Kingston: I just want to make sure everyone's comfortable before we make any lofty things but between me and you-
"Iga: I have two children, that's enough children for me, you know."
"Kingston: I mean, exactly. I'm not going to raise a new kid, but a dragon kid or we can make that work. Let's figure this out."
Iga: We'll figure it out. We’ll figure it out.
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: You guys head out, all you see this interaction. It looks like things worked out in the chest."
Ricky: Awesome.
Brennan: Awesome.
"Kingston: Oh, things went great in the chest, y'all."
"Sofia: Oh, cool, yeah, we just, uh..."
Ricky: We just sat in silence.
[cast laughs]
Kingston: Iga was off like thousands of years of tension between humans and dragons. It was really something.
"Ricky: I almost talked to Cody, but then I didn't."
[cast laughs]
Brennan: You guys-
Murph: Just kicking the wall.
"Brennan: You guys approach. Jess and Nick get back on the train. Jess looks up at you, Iga, and goes,"
"Jessica: I'm super proud of you, mom. That was so cool. That was so cool!"
[gentle piano music]
"Iga: I'm so proud of you and honestly, I could not have done it without you really opened my eyes up to some stuff."
"Brennan: She gets a little misty, wipes a tear and goes,"
Jessica: You opened my eyes up to everything. You're the best mom in the world.
Brennan: Gives you a big hug.
"Iga: Thank you, thank you. I know and I try, I love you so much. I love you both so much, you're so good."
"Brennan: They give their mom a big, big hug. Jess gets back on the train, smiles, waves and you look and see the richness here of these things that you thought were fighting when your chest was turning from this ancient thing to this New York thing and now you see Kingston with this beautiful New York egg, your beautiful old family heirloom that is even stronger than it was before because you understand it and your awesome kid who has this book of New York City magic and loves borscht bites. And it's the best of all possible worlds."
"And they take off on the train, you guys approach through the dark, dank sewers and arrive on a pipe that leads down and scale up to the top of a hot dog cart. The corner of which has a beautiful monastery made of popsicle sticks and crumpled old cans and lights and everything like that. And as you approach the monastery you see, wielding a little toothpick staff, a cockroach comes out and says,"
"Cockroach Monk: [high and scratchy] Welcome to the Monastery of The Sacred Rat, who so approaches?"
"Ricky: Sofia, you know how we didn't talk at all in the train?"
"Sofia: Yeah, sorry."
"Ricky: You were asking me repeatedly about what, where are we going? What are we doing?"
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah. It was a really quiet train ride."
"Ricky: And then for some reason, I just never answered. In my head, I was building suspense. What, I wanted to show you was, this is the Monastery of The Sacred Rat. I don't know, I thought you might like it."
"Brennan: The cockroach who is now still a little bit smaller than you, Sofia, looks and says,"
"Monk: Holy crap, you're that lady that had plastic bag shoes back when we saw those fuckin’ horses with big fucking tumors in their heads."
"Sofia: I mean, I upgraded,"
"Emily: I gesture to my Louboutins,"
"Sofia: But yeah, no, I've worn plastic bags for shoes on more than one occasion."
"Monk: Yeah, you were asleep in the trash."
"Sofia: Yeah, I've slept in trash. Hey Pete, remember when you we're talking about a spiral?"
"Pete: Yeah, for sure, yeah."
Ally: I actually take off my Beats headphones.
"Pete: What? Are we talking again? Oh, cool."
Ally: I pause my podcast.
(Emily laughing)
"Zac: I want to go to the cockroach and bow to him say,"
"Ricky: I don't know if you're aware of any of this but we are trying to find the juicy cockroach and believe you are it, the juiciest of all cockroaches."
"Monk: Ah, get the fuck out of here."
Ricky: I will not get the fuck out of here. You're a juicy cockroach.
"Monk: You're telling me I'm a juicy— [suddenly yelling, like Perry] cockroach!"
[light shining noises]
"Brennan: A bunch of other, you see leaping from the open doors are a bunch of toothpick wielding cockroach monks, who go,"
"Monks: Hey, you're attacking the master! You're attacking the headmaster of the monaste— Holy shit!"
"Brennan: You see Marty descends, gleaming with light. He goes,"
"Marty: Holy shit, the third of three spirits. We've been in this monastery communing with Kugrash for so long."
"Brennan: You see all the monks sort of bow and say,"
"Monks: All is one and one is all. Everything is connected in one universal truth which is that there's a specific rat man, who's a part of everything."
Sofia: Rat? Is it rat Jesus?
"Brennan: All of them go [puts fists and hands together and bows] and say in unison,"
"Monks: We love you, rat Jesus."
[cast laughs]
"Ricky: Wait a second, can you actually, can contact Kugrash?"
"Sofia: Yeah, I'm curious."
"Brennan: A junior cockroach monk says,"
"Junior Monk: Only the best of us can, Marty can do it."
"Brennan: He says,"
Marty: When I meditate very deeply. I can feel his whiskers.
"The camera shows Murph briefly, who has an awkward smile on his face."
"Marty: I can feel the presence. He ate the bagel of all things and he knows everything. And even when he knew everything, he still chose to love the universe."
Kingston: You all are incredibly profound.
Pete: He really is rat Jesus.
[Emily laughing]
Sofia: I would love to come meditate here and feel rat Jesus' whiskers one more time. And maybe give him one more perm.
"Brennan: Then you see all them go,"
Monks: You know how to do the sacred hairdo?
Sofia: [laughing] What's the sacred hairdo?
"Brennan: You see they say,"
"Monks: Behold, rat Jesus in the aspect of the Chinchilla!"
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: And you see that all of them look around and they say,"
"Monks: Give respect to these, the apostles of rat Jesus."
"Brennan: And all of them start to do Hairy Baby, the little dance."
Brennan demonstrates Kugrash’s hairy baby dance.
"Brennan: You see they say,"
Monks: Come into the co—
"Pete: The apostles, are they 12?"
"Brennan: Then he says,"
"Monk: Come into the courtyard, we got to talk to you, this is incredible."
"Brennan: Marty goes,"
"Marty: Oh shit, yeah, it's incredible. Rat Jesus or sometimes if we want to save time, we call him Cheesus, 'cause he's a rat and he wants the cheese."
"Iga: That’s what I like! It's the puns, yeah. Funny."
Pete: It's funny.
Marty: But have you found also the spicy pigeon and unicorn?
"Ricky: You are the last one, we found…"
[rat army war music]
"Marty: Holy moly, you can really contact Kugrash! Well, we have not much time to lose. Fellow the monks of the Monastery of The Sacred Rat. A day has come for..."
"Brennan: In the distance you hear… (imitates trumpet blaring) The monks all turn to look and they go,"
Monks: Oh no! They're here! We've been discovered.
"Ricky: Who's here, what?"
"Brennan: You see they say,"
Monks: The thing every insect has to watch out for the most: Ants! You don't want to get ants!
Ricky: What?
"Sofia: Wait, cockroaches are scared of ants? You're so superior to ants."
"Marty: [flattered] Oh, stop."
Zac: Can I use Divine Sense to see if I can detect anything from the ants?
"Brennan: You see (stomping noise) coming over here to the hot dog cart behind you, rank and file legions of ants. You see Marty says,"
"Marty: Oh, these guys had it out for us since day one."
"Brennan: And you see that one of the ants says,"
"Ant: [British, assertive] Forward, brethren, to the monastery. Destroy them in the name of our glorious queen."
Brennan: Everybody roll initiative.
(all laughing)
Lou: Wild.
Zac: Oh my God.
"Brennan: That's all for this episode of The Unsleeping City. Tune in next week, as we have our showdown at the Monastery of the Sacred Rat. [cockroach voice] We love you, Rat Jesus!"

"[the classic ""Unsleeping City"" theme plays]"
"Brennan: Hello, one and all, and welcome back to another thrilling episode of ""The Unsleeping City"". I'm your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me, as always, are our Intrepid Heroes. Say hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"All: [pretending to punch the screen] Hi, Intrepid Heroes!"
"Brennan: Last we left off, our champions of New York City had become itty bitty, oh so tiny, in order to get to the Monastery of the Sacred Rat, following their expedition to the Sixth Borough and the attack on Nod by the entity known as Null, given that name by Pete Conlan, Vox Phantasma of New York City. We discovered that this entity was moving upon the world in a very aggressive, horrifying way. It was connected both magically and through the waking world to all of these properties of isolation, erasure, the forgotten, and the feeling of emptiness and loneliness that fills the hearts of those who have forgotten their past, their future, and their present. We also found Ricky had a connection to the spirits of New York, who specifically were helping to protect, shield, and hide the city away from entities like Null. The Unicorn of the Cloisters, the spicy pigeon, who is now Perry the Pigeon, and the Juicy Cockroach, AKA Marty, who is the leader of the Monastery of the Sacred Rat, a cockroach monastery dedicated to the Sacred Rat himself, Rat Jesus, Kugrash."
Zac: [making praying motion] Cheesus.
"Brennan: We also discovered… We also had a trip to the doctor last session. Pete and Sofia checking in with Dr. Lugash Primjitzski, the Unsleeping City's premier gangster doctor. And we also had a incredible journey into the castle at the center of Iga Lisowski's family heirloom, this magical chest where Iga was the first in her line to release Smoczamatka, the Dragon Mother, and Queen of the Realms of Myth and Legend within the chest, to fly free, which seemed to strengthen and increase the magic of this place as dragons are beings of pure magic. Smoczamatka thanked Iga for this, although it calls into question what Iga's relationship to the chest, her own magic, her family, and this dragon will be. And Smoczamatka also released the troublemaker egg that had appeared to be the thing fighting back against Null the hardest, which was this incredible granite and gold graffiti-covered egg, a New York City dragon's egg, from within the hoard of this dragon. However, upon meeting the monks of the Sacred Rat, all of you discovered ants approaching the hotdog cart, a legion of which are approaching right now, and thus, we leap into combat. Let's go ahead and get our Intrepid Heroes on the board."
"Siobhan: [very seriously] Hey, quick question, Brennan, since we are tiny right now, could you say that we were the Itty Bitty New York City Committee?"
Brennan: The Itty Bitty New York City Committee indeed.
Lou: Woah.
Zac: [weakly] You could. You could.
(laughing)
Siobhan: I guess you could say that. I'm just wondering.
Ally: Just wondering if you could.
Siobhan: Just wondering if you could.
The screen shows the Roll20 set for today; it features a ton of bugs.
Ally: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Oh, my god, there's so many."
Zac: Cool.
"Siobhan: Oh, boy."
Lou: Damn.
Siobhan: Are those ants? Are those all ants?
Lou: Ants?
Brennan: You guys have some cockroach allies around you.
Emily: I don't see ants.
Zac: Are those catapults?
"Brennan: They're actually ketchupults, thank you very much."
"Siobhan: Oh, goddammit."
"Murph: Oh, no."
Zac: You ever just walk right into it?
(Brennan laughing)
Emily: Who— (laughs)
Siobhan: Their little mustard battering ram.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Emily: Who are the ants? From these little icons, who are the ants and who are the cockroaches?"
"Brennan: You can see that out on the battlefield with you, there are four cockroach monks, and then Marty, the cockroach elder, they are in the courtyard. So, these are the cockroach monks, these are the four—"
"Emily: So, that's who's around us?"
Brennan: Yeah. Those are the four that are surrounding you. That's Marty.
Zac: He's so tired.
"Brennan: He's so— [cockroach voice] Dude, forget it, he's been working his ass off. [normal] That's Marty. So, it's just the four monks and Marty in the courtyard of the monastery with you. For the ants, you'll see there are ant legionnaires, and then there are also ant centurions. These are the centurions. So, these are the ants. These are sort of the leaders or the commanders of the ants that are bigger, sort of like soldier ants."
Emily: And it looks like they're each individually commanding the ones who are working the ketchupults and the—
"Brennan: Yes. And then those are the legionnaires. The largest group is the ones that are manning, and even though you see them there, they are manning the mustard wagon, the mustard ram, and then there are squadrons of the commanders… Yeah, squadrons of commanders"
"with the ketchupults, and then these two melee squadrons as well in the back, sort of in reserve. Our first to act is gonna be Sofia Lee."
"Emily: Okay. I'm gonna ask you a really stupid question, and I know the answer's no, but before we kind of did it, that even though we were tiny, Mage Hand could still lift five pounds. Is that still the case? (laughs)"
Brennan: Nobody here has a ninth level Telekinesis as a cantrip.
"Emily: Okay. (laughing) You know, you have to ask if they're—"
"Brennan: You have to ask, and honestly, you know, Emily, you know I never knock the hustle. I never knock the hustle."
Lou: Never knock the hustle.
"Emily: Okay, then I think this is gonna be… I mean, I keep rolling well for initiative, and honestly, I don't love it. (laughs) I'm gonna go ahead and just charge. I'm gonna assume that this very front ant is gonna be commanding this mustard bottle, which seems to be a threat. So, I think I'm just gonna go to town on the commander ant."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Lou: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: That ant calls out and says,"
[fanfare]
"Ant: Monks of the Monastery of the Sacred Rat, you are hereby ordered to subject yourselves to the rule of her Rightful Queen of the Throgs Neck Colony, Her Majesty! (chanting)"
Brennan: They all yell out.
Zac: The Frog's Neck?
Brennan: Or the Queen of Throgs Neck.
Zac: Throgs Neck.
"Brennan: Throgs Neck, not a fantasy name, a real New York name of a place."
(Brennan and Emily laughing)
"Emily: Cool. I'm just gonna say,"
"Sofia: Shut the fuck up, dude."
Emily: And jump on him.
Lou: Ayy.
"Emily: I believe I should easily be able to make that. Yeah. Let's… So, I'm gonna jump on him, and I'm just gonna start hitting. Try and see what I can do."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Go ahead and roll your attacks.
"Emily: Okay, first one's a 26."
Ally: [nodding approvingly] Yeah.
"Lou: Yep, yep."
Emily: That is 10 damage. Gonna try and Stunning Strike him.
"Brennan: [shaking his head a little] Oh, god, here we fucking go."
Emily: It's this song and dance.
Brennan: I know this fucking song. Hold on.
(Emily laughing)
"Brennan: Okay. He rolls a 14, which is not gonna do it. He is stunned, baby."
"Emily: [laughs] Great, then I'll keep attacking him with advantage. Oh, god, I wish I'd Hexblade Cursed him 'cause I got a 19. That's gonna… Okay, that's gonna be a 28 to hit. Another 11 damage."
"Brennan: So, that's 10 and 11 so far, right? Yeah."
"Emily: Actually, that time I only rolled an 18. Does an 18 hit?"
"Brennan: 18 does hit, yes."
"Emily: Okay. So, that's gonna be another seven, and then I'm gonna Flurry of Blows for one more bonus attack. And that is 24. And another nine damage. And then I'll just shout out to everyone,"
Sofia: He's stunned!
(Brennan and Lou laughing)
Sofia: Go at him.
Emily: Can I do an insight check to see if these little ants are waiting on his command and authority?
"Brennan: They look pretty shocked that their commander… So basically what happens, is he says, ""You will all surrender to Her Majesty, the Queen of Throgs Neck."" Sofia sprinting across the rusted surface of the hotdog cart, you hear the reverberations off the cliffs of the soda and napkin shelves. Boom, boom, boom! (rumbling) Just grabs, spins this dude's helmet around so he's looking at the back of his helmet, and just body him with knee shots to his ant groin. Just, bam, bam, bam! And he stumbles down. All his soldiers look horrified as their stunned commander is just right in front of them."
Sofia: He just told me that you all should turn your mustard bottle around and go elsewhere. He just whispered it to me. Right? Do nothing if you agree with me.
"Brennan: That is Sofia's turn. Holy shit. It is now going to be… Let me see here. No, out of range."
Lou: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. These monks are going to join in the action. So, these monks, these two, bam, bam, are gonna run out here to join you, Sofia."
Emily: You attack with advantage.
"Brennan: Incredible. These two are going to rush out to these positions, just to defend the gate, just hold the gate of the monastery, basically. And each take a dodge action. We're gonna roll with advantage for these… For monks of the Sacred Rat. Let's see."
Emily: (laughs) I can't wait to see them in action.
"Brennan: Incredible. So, let's go ahead and roll. We're gonna roll 2d20."
"Zac: Come on, monks. Come on, little cockroaches. Get juicy."
"Brennan: Two hits on the first… Or, one hit 'cause its advantage. Hit again. Next one. Crit. Next one."
Murph: Nice.
"Brennan: Is also a hit because of the advantage. That is effectively five hits, so that's gonna be 5d6 plus eight. Hold on. I'll roll this in front of the board."
Lou: Whoo.
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: 27 points of damage. Oh my god. This dude is not dropped. He is not dropped. Yeah, no."
Siobhan: I like that the dice are in scale to this set now.
"Brennan: Yes, (laughs) absolutely. But you see two of the monks go,"
"Monks: Hell yeah, you got the fucking moves! This lady with the plastic bag shoes, she knows what time it is, huh?"
Brennan: (imitates punching) And they (whirring). Passing the toothpick stabs in between their two sets of arms. (imitates punching) Just punching at the same time as they're swinging 'cause they've got the limbs for it. These cockroach monks are pretty good.
"[marching, warlike music]"
"Brennan: After them it is going to be the ant centurions. This one is stunned. This one here is going to hold an action. Actually, no, he's gonna roll an attack against Sofia."
Emily: Which one?
Brennan: Not the one that you stunned.
Ally: Which Sofia?
Brennan: This one is going to take a double move. Homeboy here surges forward to the back of the mustard wagon and is going to bark for one of the ants to take an attack against Sofia. Hits. And that's going to be… Sofia takes four points of damage.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Next. Yeah, this one is going to just move."
"Emily: So, this is the top of a hotdog cart, right? Is there boiling oil in...?"
"Brennan: Yes. So, the hotdog cart is being kept heated by the cockroaches here, so yes, there is boiling stuff. There is hot stuff in the hotdog pits and stuff like that. Absolutely."
"Emily: Oh, I should've just stunned this dude then threw him in the boiling oil."
(laughing)
"Brennan: That is now going to be… The other centurions are going to steer their ketchupults. I'm going to need a Dexterity saving throw from Ox, Pete, and Cody."
Zac: No!
Murph: Fuck. [sighs]
"Siobhan: Cody, oh no."
"Zac: Why is Ox not next to that? (laughing) Ox, come back. Dexterity for Ox, okay."
Ally: That's 11.
"Brennan: 11, cool."
Murph: My new triple sword gives me disadvantage on dexterity checks.
Ally briefly covers their face.
"Zac: Wait, do they get plus four because they're next to Cody?"
"Brennan: 'Cause they're within 10 feet. If they're within 10 feet of Ricky, then yes, they do."
Ally: 15.
Zac: Or Cody’s. Does Cody's work?
"Murph: Yeah, Cody gets plus four to all saves to people within 10 feet."
"Zac: All right, 12."
Brennan: Okay.
Zac: 12 for Ox.
"Brennan: 12, 15 for Pete."
Murph: I got a 15 as well.
"Brennan: Okay. You guys take four points of damage as a giant splotch of ketchup hits you guys with a ketchupult. That's going to be… I'm gonna need a dexterity from Iga, Kingston, and Misiek as well."
Lou: Ooh.
"Siobhan: Mm-mm, we rolled poorly."
"Lou: Yeah, why you come for the old people like that? That's only a 7."
Siobhan: I got a 5 and Misiek got a 4.
(Lou laughs)
Brennan: You guys take 19 points of—
Lou: Damn!
Brennan: Take 19 points of acid damage.
Siobhan: Misiek is dead.
"Zac: Oh, no!"
Brennan: [dragon squeal] Misiek is toast.
Emily: What does that mean?
"Murph: Like, dead dead, or out?"
"Zac: Like, unconscious?"
"Siobhan: I mean, that's more than double his hit point max."
"Zac: Wait, how close is he to me?"
"Siobhan: He's a familiar, though. Can I revive him with Find Familiar?"
"Brennan: Oh, Misiek has died so many times. You just go back into the chest and get him again."
"Siobhan: Okay, great. Phew."
"Brennan: You wake up, I would say, every three mornings or so, you wake up and Misiek is dead and you have to go back into the chest."
Murph: Just have died of natural causes in your living room? That's horrifying.
Siobhan: Just constantly. [mimics retching]
"Brennan: He's not looking well ever. These guys are supposed to live for 15 years max, he's been alive for centuries."
Emily: All right. I look to Iga to see what her reaction is to Misiek dying.
"Iga: He dies all the time, it's fine, [rubs her forehead] it just smells a little bit when it… It's okay. I love him so much, he's a good boy."
Ricky: Who beefed?
(laughing)
Cody: Wasn't me.
"Ricky: Cody, did you beef?"
"Cody: No, I didn't beef."
"Ricky: Whoever denied it supplied it, dude."
Brennan: That's going to be—
Cody: Fuck. It's airtight.
"Brennan: That's gonna be Cody, the Night Angel's turn."
"Murph: Shit. (laughing) Oh, god. Is my moped here? It's here right? Please."
Brennan: Would you have brought it to the gnomes?
"Murph: Yes. Yes, definitely."
Emily: I would say that tracks. He's pretty obsessed with the moped.
Brennan: Cool. The moped—
Siobhan: It's the one thing that he has left.
"Murph: I need it, I can't move."
"Brennan: The moped is here. I'm not gonna fuck you on this terrible fucking sword, and then—"
"Murph: I literally can't move. Yes, I will read what my sword does right before I attack. So, it's gonna be 60 feet of movement with the moped, Cody with this giant ridiculous sword, looking extremely depressed. Revs his moped and gets pretty far, but is gonna have to hop off the moped and hoof it to this dude right here. Or, I guess I don't have to, I could do a dash with my moped, right?"
"Brennan: Uh-huh. Yes, absolutely."
"Murph: Okay. So, I'll just moped up and really halfheartedly go,"
"Cody: [monotone] Fucking Sword Art Thirsting Blade, Dark Excalibur, Mega Genesis, give me strength."
"Murph: And I will read this ridiculous sword that Brennan sent to me. You have a minus two bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, but it's plus 30 to damage. You must use your object interaction every round on your turn to make a DC 15 Athletics check, I'm not proficient, to use this weapon. So, that's me pulling it up—"
Emily: Because it's so heavy?
"Murph: Because it's so heavy. Every attack with this weapon is rolled with disadvantage and no attack made with it can be granted advantage. On a nat 20 this weapon deals an additional 20d10 necrotic damage and you regain that many hit points. This weapon gives you disadvantage on Dexterity-based checks and saving throws. So, it is so powerful—"
Emily: [holding up two fingers] You have to roll.
Zac: You can only get a nat 20.
"Emily: You have to roll a nat 20, but with disadvantage."
Siobhan: Two nat 20s.
Murph: Twice.
Emily: You have to roll two nat 20s.
Murph: After getting— yeah. So...
"Siobhan: After beating your 15 Athletics check, which you don't have proficiency in."
"Murph: So, just to lift my sword, I need to roll an 11, so I'll just roll that in front of the table."
Brennan: Roll in front of the table.
Murph: Cody tries his damnedest to lift this thing.
Murph rolls a natural 1.
(cast laughing)
"Lou: Haaaa! Damn, dude."
"Murph: I fart. I do fart. After Ricky made fun of me, I just rip ass so hard."
Zac: Ricky has a perfect sense of smell.
Brennan: I'm gonna need a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw right now.
Murph: Fuck!
Ally: You have disadvantage.
Emily: To not get crushed by it?
Siobhan: With disadvantage.
Emily: To not get crushed by your own sword?
Brennan: That was a natural one.
(laughing)
"Murph: All right, I'm rolling them in front of the board. I get plus two to this."
Brennan: Roll in front of the board.
"Murph: I get a plus two to this. (it’s a 14 and a 5) Fuck. Okay, so—"
Lou: 7\. It's okay.
Murph: I got a 7.
Lou: It's not 20.
(laughing)
Brennan: Okay.
Zac: Do you get a plus four?
Ally: It's not 20.
"Murph: No, only plus two. Oh wait, was it saving throw?"
Brennan: Saving throw.
"Murph: Okay, so, sorry. So, I do have my aura. I am still a paladin somehow. I got an 11."
"Brennan: An 11, cool. The DC was 20."
Murph: Great. Very neat.
Brennan: Hold on one second.
Zac: Stack.
"Brennan: Cody, you do make it to that square, but rolling that Athletics check, you, on your moped, go into top speed, go to make a slight turn, over correct, and wipe out on your moped, stabbing yourself very badly for 30 points of damage as you crash."
"Ally: [?] Oh, no!"
Brennan: As you crash your moped.
"Cody: Mega Genesis, how could you?"
"Mega Genesis: What's up? I'm the bad boy of the triple sword. Get ready for Thirsting Blade, Dark Excalibur, Mega Ge—"
Brennan: (imitates banging) Wipe out.
Zac: For 30 points of damage? Is that what you—
Brennan: He gets into a top speed moped crash holding a sword that is sharp in all directions. There's no way to hold this without… You know how Darth Maul would absolutely have cut himself in half? You know how double weapons exist fucking nowhere in real history or life?
Murph: It's a triple weapon. It's a fork.
"Brennan: It's just a made up, nerd… People don't fucking have a way to hold a weapon so that a sharp point is ever pointing back at you."
Murph: I'm just laying in it. I'm wearing tiny shoes from Pete that are too small for my feet. I have that way too big shirt and pants from the construction worker and I'm just covered in a giant sword under my moped.
Cody: Fucking leave me here.
(cast laughing)
Brennan: Fucking leave me here.
Ally: Oh my god.
"Zac: Should you use your second attack, or?"
(laughing)
"Murph: Oh, I do have a second."
"Brennan: No, no."
Murph: Fuck. No?
"Brennan: Cody cannot… You have an action, but you have to roll, as your object interaction, an Athletics check to see if you can use the sword that turn. You cannot use the sword this turn because you rolled a natural 1. You have an action left—"
"Murph: Oh, right. Cool."
"Brennan: But there are no attacks happening this turn, at least with Thirsting Blade, Dark Excalibur, Mega Genesis."
Siobhan: Can you punch the ant?
"Murph: I hold my hand out and I'll cast Inflict Wounds. So, I just go like,"
"Cody: Fuck you, dude."
Murph: From under the moped.
Cody: Fucking eat my ass.
"Murph: It needs to… Okay, it's a plus 8 to hit. Let's see. 26 to hit."
Brennan: 26 hits.
"Murph: Okay. I'm rolling the damage. I got D&D Beyond here. Nine, 13 damage."
Brennan: Oh my god.
"Murph: Yeah. I think it's just 13 necrotic damage. Jesus Christ, what a shitty turn."
"Sofia: Cody, I was gonna ask if you're okay, but I can tell you're not."
Cody: No.
Sofia: But I wanted to make the move to let you know that I care if you're okay.
Cody: Appreciate it. I'm just gonna stay under this fucking moped.
"Murph: I guess I get up so that they don't get advantage on me, and that's my turn."
"Brennan: You guys see Cody's got some bad road rash and a bad cut on him from… I can't believe you rolled a nat 1 on your first roll. Whoo, baby. Okay. That is Cody's turn."
Siobhan: Legendary.
Brennan: Legendary. A legendarily bad turn. Maybe the worst turn in Dimension 20 history.
Murph: Has anyone ever done 30 damage to themselves and done nothing?
Lou: 10d6 to self.
"Emily: That's not true, you—"
Zac: You hurt somebody a little bit.
Emily: You did Inflict Wounds.
"Murph: Oh yeah, I did. I got to reach my hand out and Inflict Wounds after I dropped my fucking sword on myself."
"Brennan: ""Fuck you, dude,"" from the ground, did Inflict Wounds on this ant."
(cast laughing)
"Emily: Wow, I love this sword. [laughs] It's so funny."
"Brennan: This is very, very good. Very, very good. Okay. That's Cody. The commander that rushed up behind the mustard wagon, you see calls out and says,"
"Ant Commander: Ants, pay no heed. Fall back, fire!"
[military snare drum marching beat]
Brennan: And you see that the mustard wagon is going to move back. Oh. Moves back. I'm gonna need a dexterity saving throw from Sofia and both these monks.
Emily: Okay.
Lou: And the centurion?
"Brennan: And the centurion, actually. So, we're gonna roll—"
Emily: He's gonna automatically fail Dex saves.
Lou: Ooh.
"Brennan: Oh, baby."
Emily: Because he's stunned.
Murph: They're gonna mustard their own guy?
"Emily: Oh, I just crit! I crit, I got a 20 on my Dex save."
"Brennan: With Evasion you take no damage. These cockroach monks have a plus two to this save. The DC's very low, the DC's only 10. Hold on one second. Eight or higher will do it. Oh, one of them does not get it done. So, Sofia, you take no damage. One of these… You see that they see centurion is a goner, and these ants ruthlessly and remorselessly torch their own centurion, squeeze the bottle, and blast Sofia and both cockroaches. [mustard squirt noise] As they do so… Let me just see here real quick."
"Emily: Is this like… I've never used this before. Just 'cause I don't know what the mustard is reflavored as, but would this be a Deflect Missiles opportunity, or?"
Brennan: This is unfortunately Area of Effect.
"Emily: Okay, yeah."
"Zac: But you don't take any damage, right?"
"Emily: Right, yeah, no, I take no damage."
"Brennan: 15 and 12, that's 27. 27 means this monk has taken—"
"Emily: Oh, I see what you mean."
Brennan: 13\. You guys see this monk here drops to death saves.
Emily: Oh!
Zac: No!
Emily: No.
"Brennan: (whooshing) As mustard splatters all over. That is the mustard wagon's turn, and now it's gonna be these ant legionnaires that are gonna charge forward."
Zac: They go twice?
Brennan: Only the centurions went.
"Zac: Oh, the legionnaires, gotcha."
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. These guys surge forward over here. These guys are going to (imitates marching) surge here. And these guys are going to go, gonna come around here. One. Two. Three. Four. Surrounding Cody. And then—"
"Murph: I just realized something, Brennan."
Brennan: Yeah?
"Murph: Cody definitely doesn't have leather armor, the studded leather armor anymore, he definitely just has... right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Murph: 'Cause he just… So, my armor class is, what is it? 10 plus your Dex?"
Brennan: Yep.
"Murph: Cool, so my armor class is now 12."
Emily laughs. Siobhan and Ally have their hands over their mouths. Zac has his face in his hands.
"Brennan: Cody, you see these ants… Cody, only you can see these ants right now. You see that they are carrying long straws. They have long pieces of straw around them. But now we're gonna roll a bunch of attacks to see—"
Ally: No.
"Brennan: How much you can see more than that. So, what's your current armor class, Cody?"
Murph: 12.
"Brennan: Ohh, boy. 12, let’s see."
Murph: Trying to get up my sword to block.
Cody: Come on.
(Emily laughs)
Brennan: You take five points of slashing damage.
Murph: Okay.
"Brennan: [rolls] Oh, shit."
Murph: No.
"Brennan: You take five points of slashing damage, 12, 14, 17 points of piercing damage, and I'm gonna need three Constitution saving throws."
Murph: First one is a 17.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Next one is a 16. Next one is a 24.
Brennan: You are not poisoned.
Murph stares with a truly terrified look before rolling his eyes in relief.
"Brennan: As these ant legionnaires, (grunts) start slashing with gladiuses they are also biting you with their mandibles, and you can feel powerful ant venom as they attempt to bite you. You see this group of ants to the north of you hustle towards the wall and vanish."
Ally: No.
"Siobhan: Oh, shit."
"Emily: Oh. As in, they cast Invisibility, or as in, they entered something?"
"Brennan: You're surrounded by ants on all sides, Cody, that are kicking your ass. You can't see past that Heineken bottle, so you don't see what happens when they actually get to the wall."
"Murph: All right. I will yell,"
"Cody: Some ants are kicking my ass, but they're big ants, so it's fine. There's other ants that either turned invisible or jumped over a wall. They're all big ants."
"Brennan: 30, hold on. Okay. A bunch of these ants are also gonna take some shots at Sofia, whose armor class is currently 19. One, two, three. Four. One, two. Holy shit. All misses as peel 'em, these spears. Also, you can do Deflect Missiles if you want… No, because that's only if it hits."
"Emily: It's only if it hits, yeah."
"Brennan: Yeah, so you effortlessly are spinning out of the way of the mustard, take no damage, spears rain past you. None of them hit. That is going to be Kingston Brown."
"Lou: Okay. [disappointed] Cody, what are you at?"
Murph: I'm at 36.
(Emily laughing)
Lou: Okay. Okay.
"Cody: I'm fine, Kingston."
Kingston: And you're trapped?
"Emily: Kingston, I think I can go retrieve him, if you wanna do other stuff."
"Cody: No one needs to retrieve me, it's fine."
Ally: Did you shit your pants and then a bunch of ants bit you?
"Cody: I farted, I didn't fucking shit my pants."
Iga: You've got ants in your pants?
Cody: I fucking farted.
Iga: Cody.
Cody: I ripped. I fucking ripped a loud one—
"Iga: It's because the pants are so big, the ants can get in there."
"Cody: Oh. No, the ants are bigger than the pants."
Ricky: How’s your moped?
Cody: What?
Ally: I don't know if I've ever—
Ricky: How’s your moped?
Cody: My moped’s flipped.
"Ally: If I've told this story on this show, but one of the funniest things ever was, in class one time, a woman in the hallway outside farted and dropped all the papers she was holding. And that one, two, it was"
the funniest thing ever. And the idea that you stabbed yourself after farting is so funny.
(laughing)
Lou: Too good.
Emily: You crashed your moped 'cause you were distracted by your own fart.
"Lou: I'm gonna do… Okay, I look to Sofia and I say,"
"Kingston: All right, you get him to me and we'll take care of him."
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah."
"Lou: And I'll get… I'll go, I think this is about 30 feet, right? Check."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Lou: Yeah, I'll go right there. Actually, I should go right here. I'm gonna cast… How exposed are these ants?"
"Brennan: Which ones? The ones carrying the wagon, or the ones around Cody?"
Lou: The ones carrying the wagon.
"Brennan: They are, I know they look like they're on top of it, but they're actually sort of pushing it from the sides as they move along."
Lou: Can I throw a Lightning Bolt just down that line?
(whooshing)
Murph: You love to see it.
Emily: Oh.
Murph: You absolutely love to see it.
Brennan: Holy shit.
Lou: Wow.
"Brennan: Yes, Kingston, you absolutely can."
"Sofia: See, I wanted you to do something fun for yourself."
"Kingston: Yeah, I wanted to do it, too, but I was like, I wanna take care of the boy."
"Sofia: The boy, I think we can, yeah, throw those lightning bolts."
Kingston: We'll get him back.
"Lou: Yeah, we'll cast fourth level Lightning Bolt. I just throw 9d6 down the line."
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me 9d6 damage, Kingston."
Lou: You know what? We'll roll it… Can I roll it in this? I don't know how.
Brennan: Yeah. Backslash roll—
Murph: Just slash roll.
"Brenan: And then space ""9d6""."
Lou: Backslash roll—
Siobhan: It's forward slash.
Brennan: Or forward slash roll.
"Murph: Yeah, just slash roll."
Lou: Did that work?
"Brennan: Yeah, there it is."
Ally: Ooh.
Emily: Yeah.
Lou: Cool.
"Brennan: Ooh, Doctor."
Siobhan: Wow.
Lou: 31.
Emily: Yeah.
Lou: 31 points of damage to anyone who fails a DC17 saving throw.
"Brennan: Okay. Let's throw 6d20 in front of the board. A 16. Oh, god, those are low rolls. Jesus."
"The rolls were three 8s, a 3, a 9, and a 16."
Murph: Wow.
Brennan: Hold on. And you did 31 points of damage?
Lou: I did.
"Brennan: Oh, god."
Siobhan: Bye-bye!
Emily: Does Lightning Bolt catch things on fire? Does it do like a—
Lou: It does. Anything that's not worn—
"Emily: So, those Popsicle sticks might go on fire."
"Siobhan: Yeah, it seems like that's wood. Seems pretty flammable."
Lou: Igniting flammable objects.
"Brennan: Yeah, actually, I'm gonna make a final roll for the mustard wagon… 12’s not gonna do it. So, you see the mustard wagon is going to take 31 points of damage. (whooshing) Kingston, you stride out, get partial cover behind that hotdog… There's these sort of little barricades around the monastery, hotdog buns with toothpicks put through them. You, boom, call up lightning. The metallic surface of the hotdog cart ripples with static electricity. Lightning bolt appears in your hand. (whooshes) First five ants in the line die."
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Mustard wagon catches on fire. You have drastically impaired the mustard wagon's ability to move, which means all those ants fighting Cody will have to choose between finishing Cody off or jumping to their commander's order to move the wagon, basically."
"Lou: Great. So, I did help Cody. Yes, there it is."
Emily: Yeah.
Murph: This ultimately helps me more.
(laughing)
"Lou: Kingston looks back at that one cockroach and is like,"
"Kingston: This is good, right, that they can't shoot mustard at us?"
"Brennan: He's like,"
"Cockroach: Yeah, this is extremely good! The mustard fucks us up, it's not good for ya."
"Kingston: Great, great."
"Sofia: Yeah, the mustard felled one of them out here. There's a cockroach making death saves out here 'cause of the mustard."
Kingston: I'm on him next.
(cast laughing)
"Brennan: Amazing. Okay, next in the initiative is going to be Ricky Matsui."
"Zac: Ricky is going to use Ox's movement to here. So, come over here. He's gonna use Hypnotic Pattern, and it's a 30-foot cube."
Brennan: Woah.
"Zac: I think the range is 120 feet, to uh… Yeah, that centurion that you just… To like, here."
Ally: Whoo.
Brennan: Damn.
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Get as many as I can in there.
"Brennan: Dude, I think… Hold on."
"Zac: I may not get that one, the last one on the right, but I think I get pretty much all the rest of them."
"Brennan: Yeah. Everyone else you can absolutely get, dude."
"Zac: And that's a Wisdom saving throw, DC16."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. These two centurions are gonna use their reaction, as they see you coming to do magic, yell to two of the legionnaires and go,"
Ant Centurion: Forward!
"Brennan: Two of the little guys get to use their reaction because of that reaction to sprint their movement forward and dive over here by these barricades. The rest are gonna get hit by that pattern. The DC for you is 16, and this is a Wisdom saving throw?"
"Zac: Yes. And if they are hit, they'll be charmed by the spell and get incapacitated with a speed of zero for a minute."
Ally: Whoo!
"Brennan: Jesus. Okay, this is the important one for the two centurions. They need 13s or higher. One, the centurion right here that's the closest. So, this guy right here is full incapacitated. This dude succeeds on his save over here. Now we're gonna roll 6d20 for the legionnaires. They need 13s or higher as well. Fail, fail. Four of six fail that roll. Incredible. So, these front two fail, and these two over on the left hand side of the ketchupult fail. So, they are all incapacitated as well. Ricky, what does your magic look like as you surge towards the edge of that giant hotdog?"
Zac: I think it's like a floating just idea of a picnic. Just a floating picnic blanket with the red and white squares.
"Brennan: They look around, they say,"
"Ants: Brothers, the promised land, Elysium awaits! The Picnic of Paradise!"
Brennan: And they look like they have already died. Incredible.
"Zac: Oh, and then, yeah, I think maybe… That was like, 30 feet of Ox's movement and he has another… I guess I'll take a double move so he has another 90 feet to go here… Oh, woah. To here."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: So.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Great.
Zac: Move here with Ox.
Brennan: Awesome. You duck in over there. It is going to be Iga's turn.
"Siobhan: This is the first time I'm using magic since my interaction with the dragon, so I'd like to say,"
"Iga: Hello, hi, if you can hear me, I would love to be able to fly over to where Kingston is, and then maybe Shatter this area over here. Can you hear? Hello? Can you hear me? Is that okay? I just wanna have permission?"
[Smoczamatka growling]
"Brennan: You fling into the air, feeling more buoyant—"
Iga: Okay!
(laughing)
Siobhan: So then I'd like to cast Shatter. Can you do this?
"Brennan: Yeah. Back, by the… Yeah, cool, cool, cool."
"Siobhan: So, I think I can hit this centurion and all four of these ants back here and the ketchup and the mustard."
"Brennan: Yeah, I think you—"
Siobhan: And Shatter damages all non-magical objects that aren't worn or carried.
"Brennan: Hell yes. So, we're gonna roll saves for those five, first of all."
"Siobhan: Yeah. So, it's a Constitution saving throw."
"Brennan: Hell yes. Con save. Need a 14 or higher from the centurion. Centurion hits a nat 20. Four next to the centurion. Save, save, fail, fail. So, the two in the back fail. Now we're gonna roll for the ketchupult and the mustard wagon as well. Fail from the mustard wagon."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: Success from the ketchupult.
Siobhan: Dexterous catapult.
"Brennan: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Well, this is Con, right?"
"Siobhan: Oh yes, it's Constitution."
"Brennan: Cool, cool, cool."
"Siobhan: So, that's 24 damage or 12 halved. Oh."
"Brennan: Okay. Does it do double damage to objects, or no?"
"Siobhan: A non-magical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage. Oh, so they don't actually roll Con saves, I think. I think they just take the damage."
"Brennan: Damn, okay. That ketchupult is looking messed up. As for the mustard wagon, Iga, you fly up, boom! You guys hear a thunderous roar. The bridge collapses. Those two ants in the back fall immediately to their death, and you can hear the steam rising as they hit the water underneath. The mustard wagon ruptures and mustard blasts out of the back into the thing and is fully broken. The mustard wagon is destroyed."
Ally: Woah.
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: Hell yes. Gone, gone, and ketchup wagon took 24 points of shatter damage. Incredible magic casting from Iga. Boom! The biggest siege weapon they had is no more. After Iga, that is Pete's turn."
"Ally: Okay, I'm going to take a full dash and get over here next to Ricky, maybe tucked up here kind of."
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Hidden. And then I'm gonna say to Cody,"
"Pete: Hey, man. Like, yeah, that was kind of embarrassing, but who fucking cares, man? You're still super metal!"
"Ally: And as I say ""Metal,"" I would like to cast a fifth level Fireball. Or, you know what? I'm gonna say all of that from not a double movement so that I can cast… No, fuck it, yeah, I'm gonna do that. That's exactly what I'm going to do."
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: And I'm going to use Careful Spell, so when I tell Cody he's metal, all of a sudden flames erupt all around him and he's untouched. Him and his moped."
Murph: Hell yeah.
Ally: And that should get everyone. It's 20-foot.
"Brennan: 20-foot radius, right?"
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: So, let's see. So, that's like, 40 feet. Let me just see something. I'm gonna set an aura real quick. Cool. If you wanna center it on that centurion right there, you'll hit everybody but the front two ants on the left."
"Siobhan: Oh, there we go."
Ally: Amazing.
Murph: Woah.
Siobhan: There it is.
Lou: Holy shit.
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
Emily: Yeah.
"Ally: All right, I'm gonna roll. It's just slash roll?"
"Brennan: Slash roll, and you're doing fifth level?"
"Ally: Yes, I'm doing fifth level, so that should be 10d6."
Brennan: 10d6 is right.
Ally rolls three 6s.
Lou: Woah.
Siobhan: Wow.
Lou: W-O-A-H.
Ally: Hell yeah.
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: That spells woah.
[Ally and Lou laugh]
"Brennan: Okay. Well, let's see here. 34 damage is going to be... I'm gonna say that these two centurions are actually going to use their reactions to move two of their ants out of the blast. Boom, boom. So, that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. We're gonna roll 10d20. These guys need 14s or higher to just save for half. One, two, three, four."
Siobhan: Two nat 1s.
Zac: Woah.
Murph: Wow.
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: That's only—
Siobhan: Brutal.
Brennan: Two of those are saves.
[Ally laughs]
"Brennan: Oh my god, okay."
Ally: You know what? Can I Bend Luck and try to get that 16 down with a four?
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Yeah, if you wanna do it, go for it."
Ally rolls a 1.
B: One!
"Ally: Ah, damn. All right."
"Brennan: Oh, no."
Lou: Almost.
"Brennan: Cool. That 34 is still 17. We're gonna roll saves for the two legionnaires as well. Both of them fail. That's 34 damage to both of them. Both of the centurions are still up, however, Pete, you see. [imitates explosion]"
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Eruption of fire, all of them are gone. We're gonna roll a save for the ketchupult as well. The ketchupult and mustard wagon are fully… Well, the mustard wagon was already done. The ketchupult also erupts in flame and is destroyed, so both that northern ketchupult and the mustard wagon are no longer functional."
"Emily: And the southern ketchupult is being manned by those who fell for Hypnotic Spectre. I mean, Hypnotic—"
"Brennan: It looks like it still has a partial skeleton crew that might be rolling with disadvantage, but it looks like they still have some non- hypnotized ants down there. So, it's still potentially functional. Holy shit, you guys are very powerful."
[Ally laughs]
"Cody: Thanks, Pete, that was awesome."
"Pete: For sure, man, you're great."
"Cody: [despondent] I'm not, but thank you so much."
"Ricky: [quietly] Pete, I'm not sure if we should tell him he's great."
"Pete: He's so great, man. That's my roommate right there! Yeah! Your shoes look cool."
Cody: Thank you.
[Ricky nods and claps]
Emily: (laughs) You just complimented your own shoes.
Siobhan: They're size six men's shoes.
"Pete: Dude, those tiny-ass Foamposites look amazing on you."
"Brennan: You guys see Marty rushes over to his fallen comrade, looks to you, Kingston, and says,"
"Marty: I got my guy, you're good. Take care of your boy!"
"Kingston: Yeah. All right. Okay. Cockroach magic, cool, cool, cool, cool. This city is the greatest."
(laughing)
"Brennan: Sofia, that's gonna be you."
"Emily: Okay, so it seems like all this area of effect stuff is incredibly powerful. Do I have an insight if I cast Darkness on this catapult? If they're already rolling with disadvantage, it's not like it's going to… It's not gonna be double disadvantaged, or something like that."
Brennan: You could potentially cast Darkness on them and prevent them from even picking the right square. That's still a possibility.
Emily: Ooh.
Murph: There are also those—
"Emily: I know, that's what I'm trying to decide."
Murph: Ants who disappeared.
"Emily: You all are so good at the area of effect stuff, I think I'm just going to use some of my movement right now to jump up onto the top of this Heineken bottle and see what's going on, and survey where the ants disappeared from."
"Brennan: The first thing you see, Sofia, when you jump on top of the Heineken bottle, is that right there. You see a—"
Emily: The ladder?
Brennan: The ladder. A siege ladder made of straws—
Murph: [softly] Cool.
Brennan: Appears up at the top. You definitely have the jump speed to get… Definitely have the jump distance to get up to the top of the shelf if you want to.
Emily: Yeah. Do I get the sense that they're invisible and climbing up it right now? Do I sense it here?
"Brennan: You don't think they're invisible, you think they already made it to the top."
"Emily: Oh. Okay. Then I'm gonna jump to the top, kick the siege ladder down and try to find them."
Lou: Hell yes.
Emily: 'Cause I do still have movement left and I can Step of the Wind if I need.
Lou: Damn. Tiny Sofia is—
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Zac: You can also just run up walls, right?"
"Emily: Yeah, that's true, I just run up the wall. (laughs)"
"Brennan: As you leap to the top, Sofia, you find what you're looking for. Blam."
Siobhan: Oof.
"Emily: Yeah, baby. All right. So, I'm gonna kick this. I am gonna kick this. My object interaction's gonna be kicking the siege ladder down so no one else can come."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: Do you think that I had to use a Step of the Wind to get up here?
"Brennan: So yeah, Sofia, you kick the ladder with your free interaction."
"Emily: Yeah. And then I think I'll Step of the Wind to get to this guy, and they can all get opportunity attacks if they want."
Brennan: They do wanna do that.
[Lou laughs]
"Brennan: [counting dice] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Six. Two. [rolls dice] Miss, miss, hit, hit, hit, hit."
Emily: Shield. [smiles] Does Shield change those hits?
Brennan: The lowest of them were—
Emily: You know what? I think I wanna take it. I wanna take it.
Murph: Oh my god.
Brennan: Oh no. Okay.
"Ally: But it's poison, right?"
Emily: Is it poison?
"Zac: Oh, I don't know."
Murph: They tried to poison me.
Lou: I think it's only mandible attacks.
"Brennan: Sofia, you take 22 points of damage. I'm gonna need four constitution saving throws."
"Emily: Oh, this is gonna poison me? In that case, can I say I do Shield, or do you want to be a stickler?"
"Brennan: I'm gonna say that Sofia followed, because you didn't know there was gonna be poison until you get poisoned, I'm gonna say that no Shield this time."
Emily: Okay.
"Zac: Oh, so you wanna be a stickler, is what I'm hearing?"
[Brennan laughs]
Ally: Sounds like—
"Emily: Okay. Four constitution saves? I mean, I'm fully going to be poisoned. Poison means I get disadvantage on my attacks?"
Brennan: Yes.
Emily: Fuck me. Okay.
Brennan: The DC is very low.
Emily: 14 is the first one.
Brennan: 14 passes.
Emily: 11 is the next one.
Brennan: Exactly passes. You can't get one less than that.
"Lou: [claps] Come on, now."
Emily: I got another 11.
Siobhan: Ugh.
Siobhan clasps her hands in prayer while Murph covers his head with both hands.
Emily: I failed. Seven.
Brennan: Oh.
Siobhan: Damn.
Murph: Fuck.
Ally: Bend Luck?
Brennan: A seven—
Ally: If I get a four?
Siobhan: If you get a four.
Murph: You need to get a four.
"Brennan: You know you have to get exactly a four, right?"
Ally: I'll roll it on the board.
Zac: I'm worried about how bad this poison is.
Brennan: Roll it on the board.
"Naturally, Ally rolls a 4."
[cast cheers]
Brennan: You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
"Siobhan: Ah, yes."
"Murph: Ally, you are unbelievable."
Ally: Hell yeah.
Murph: You are unbelievable.
"Ally: I can just feel you up there and I'm like,"
"Pete: Sofia B., take care of yourself!"
[Emily and Siobhan laugh]
"Sofia: Pete, you are just fucking getting me these days."
Pete: I love you guys. I love all you guys. Did you know that?
Brennan: [laughs] Unbelievable—
"Zac: Ricky looks at Pete and is like,"
"Ricky: Sheesh, is that what I was?"
[Emily and Brennan laugh]
Brennan: Truly un-fucking-believable. Sofia—
Emily: And then—
Brennan: You are not poisoned.
Emily: Now I have my action.
Brennan: Go ahead and take your swings.
Emily: First one's going to be a 15.
Brennan: You do not hit on a 15.
Emily: Okay. Next one's gonna be 18.
Brennan: That does hit.
Emily: Okay. That's eight damage and I'm gonna Stunning Strike.
"Brennan: Eight damage, Stunning Strike. He succeeds, with a 15."
"Emily: Okay. All right, well, I'm in the fray now."
Sofia: I found them!
[Murph laughs]
"Murph: Seeing this insane monk jump up there and just a distant, ""I found them,"" and the sounds of fighting."
Zac: [imitating Brennan’s sword clashing sound effects] Ting ting ting ting.
"Brennan: ""Found 'em."" Incredible."
"Emily: I look at them all, though, and I say,"
"Sofia: Shield is coming for you,"
[Brennan laughs]
Sofia: Next time you're back.
Brennan: Amazing. That is Sofia's turn. We're gonna get a death save for our fallen buddy.
"Siobhan: Oof, pour one out."
"Brennan: Three, that's a fail. However, the other monks are going to leap into action. One. Two, three. Let's go. That is a hit for six damage to this little legionnaire, and this dude's gonna run over here, start getting the last soldiers over on the mustard wagon. Doesn't hit, needed a 10. That is gonna be the monks of the Sacred Rat. (yells) (imitates punching) Now it's gonna be the centurions. This centurion's going to come for you, Sofia."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Misses twice. Gonna use his reaction to grant one of his allies an attack, which is a natural one. Good job, buddy."
(laughing)
Brennan: Way to go. This centurion fighting Cody's gonna take two swings. He's going to hit. I'm gonna need a constitution.
Murph: 16.
Brennan: That passes. You do take nine points of piercing damage.
"Murph: Okay, still up."
"Brennan: This dude is going to close as well. He's gonna take two swings. Misses horribly both times. Guys, we can't be rolling like this."
(Emily laughs)
Brennan: This dude is gonna stay with his ketchupult that's still operational to continue firing. And that is—
"Zac: The other guy's hypnotized, right?"
Brennan: Other dude is hypnotized. You see this dude right here. Another squadron appears over the edge of the board.
Siobhan: What?
"Brennan: And (whooshes). They are going to hustle. (hums) These guys are gonna move quickly and make it all the way here. Actually. Awesome. That is now going to be the ketchupult. The operating ketchupult that I believe still… Was partially injured, so is firing with disadvantage, which basically means I'm gonna have asked for dexterity saving throws from Kingston and Iga with advantage."
"Lou: I'm still old, so."
Siobhan: [Iga voice] Pretty old.
Lou: First one was very bad.
"Siobhan: [Iga voice] Okay, I did good, I got a dirty 20."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Lou: Oh, a two and a three over here."
Brennan: Aww.
Siobhan: Oof.
"Lou: Well, I guess that's actually a three and a four."
"Brennan: Kingston, you take 12 acid damage, Iga, you take six. Marty takes the full 12 as he goes prostrate over his friend's body to protect him from getting a failed death save."
Lou: Aww.
Emily: Aww.
Lou: What an absolute king.
"Emily: I've gotta remember that move, that's good."
[Brennan laughs]
Emily: Teaching good things here.
"Brennan: That's the ketchupult. Cody, that's you, baby."
"Murph: Oh, boy. I mean, I've gotta try to use this sword one more time."
Ally is covering their face.
[Emily and Siobhan laugh]
Murph: I just have to.
"Brennan: Okay, let's see the athletics check. You need an 11 or higher, in front of the board."
Emily: I fucking love this.
Zac: Ricky's just.
Ricky’s eyes are wide.
[Zac laughs]
Cody: Please! [yells]
"Murph: Just absolutely heaving, lifting with my back. Okay. I lift it successfully, that is—"
[Siobhan yells]
Lou raises his fist victoriously.
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: Hell yeah.
Brennan: Now you're rolling an attack with disadvantage.
[Siobhan laughs]
Murph: Okay. I'm just gonna roll two D20s. Know that I have a plus six to this.
Murph rolls a 10 and a 1.
Murph: Natural one.
"Emily cracks up while Ally, Siobhan and Zac cover their mouths and fall out of frame shaking from laughter."
Murph: Don't laugh so hard!
Siobhan: A perfect second beat.
Emily: This is the funniest shit.
Ally: Oh my god.
Emily: This is the real Hypnotic Pattern.
Brennan: Murph—
"Emily: I'm gonna say, I've been shocked by this show."
"Brennan: Murph, I am gonna need just a DC 15 dexterity saving throw here."
Murph: No!
Lou: Stop trying to make it sound like that's easy.
Murph rolls a 12 and a 5.
"Emily: Oh, you got it!"
"Murph: No, that's not."
"Brennan: No, five is disadvantage. Is that 15?"
Siobhan: It’s at disadvantage.
Brennan: Do you have a plus 10 to dexterity?
"Murph: No, I have a plus six to dexterity."
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: You're gonna roll another 10d6?
Brennan: No.
Lou: Come on. You monster.
"Brennan: I'm not gonna roll another 10d6. Murph, it is your choice. You may either deal your weapon's damage to yourself."
Murph’s eyes go wide and his mouth falls open.
Brennan: Or go prone to avoid doing so.
"Murph: I have to go prone, I just absolutely have to."
[Emily cracks up]
"Brennan: You guys— You guys see Cody manage to get this thing up. You see a full back spasm, and Cody goes down hard."
Cody: [yells in pain] Oh! No!
[Emily and Zac laugh]
Ally: Does he… does he fart?
"Brennan: Yeah, he farts hard. He farts super—"
Ally: That's just a nat one?
Cody: [farting] No!
"Brennan: Cody, you do have another attack with your attack action."
Murph: Okay.
"Lou: Oh, yeah."
"Murph: [laughs] I already have disadvantage, so I just attempt to swing it again at him."
"Brennan: Yep, you attack him from prone."
Lou: Let's go.
Murph: Cool.
"Lou: Let's go, this is it."
Brennan: This is it.
Zac: This is—
Murph: Fuck. 10.
"Brennan: 10\. You manage, from the ground, to kind of scrap it slowly over your head."
[Cody groans pathetically]
[sword scraping]
Brennan: This is the funniest thing that's ever happened.
Emily: It's really killing me.
Murph: This is so shitty.
Ally: Oh my god.
Murph: I guess while I'm on the ground I just cast Shield of Faith on myself.
(laughing)
Brennan: You cast—
"Cody: Eye of the fucking Lord of Darkness, the Flame, protect me. Bazathrax, make fucking fire come around me, or something."
"Brennan: Bazathrax goes,"
"Bazathrax: What's going on out there, dude? You crushing? Are you crushing right now?"
Cody: Are you not paying attention? Can you not see anything? Can you sense anything?
"Bazathrax: Dude, I'm in your skin. I'm in your tattoo, dude. Unless you tell me what's going on, I got no freakin' idea what's going on out there."
Cody: You don't sense things?
"Bazathrax: Dude, I'm fuckin' trapped in here, bro!"
"Cody: All right, all right."
Murph: We're gonna cast Shield of Faith.
"Brennan: [laughs] Cody, you cast Shield of Faith. You have to stay prone in order to have not taken that damage on that nat one."
"Murph: Awesome. So, I'm just under my moped again. I flipped the moped when I did it."
"Emily: What sort of faith is shielding you right now, Cody? [laughs] I'm just kinda curious."
Murph: I think I'm just—
Zac: Does it look like that sheet you had earlier?
[Emily and Murph laugh]
"Murph: Yeah, I'm once again in a cocoon—"
Lou: Lil cocoon.
"Murph: Of the sheet that divides. I'm just on the ground, cocooned in a sheet, under a moped. As I swung, I knocked the moped over again and did a front flip over it and farted and got trapped."
[Ally and Emily laugh]
"Siobhan: It's like a ""Dragon Ball Z"" sheet. It's very worn."
Zac: Threadbare.
Ally: Oh my god.
[Siobhan and Murph laugh]
Murph: Just looking up at the sky.
"Brennan: Sofia, attacks are raining down on you."
Emily: All right. Shield! Now I use it.
Brennan: None of them hit.
Emily: Yeah. [whirls her fists]
[whooshing]
"Brennan: Here comes some more. Not… Oh, one, a single solitary hit. I am gonna need a constitution saving throw."
"Emily: Okay. Yeah, baby, 17."
Lou: Brrrah!
Brennan: You take four points of piercing damage.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Bada boom, bada bam. Hell yeah."
Ally: God.
"Brennan: You all see… These guys are now gonna come, one, two, three, four, around this cockroach monk. They're gonna take some swings on him. AC is only 14, not looking good. Two nat 20s."
Murph: Oh no.
Lou: What?
Brennan: And then—
Ally: Fuck.
"Brennan: Two nat 20s, one bite, one, two, three, four. This guy goes down."
Zac: How much damage was it?
Brennan: The large attack did 14 damage.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: As he drops, one of them hits with a bite attack and gives him two failed death saves. As they surround... These two dudes are going to... rush over here. Let me get a… Iga, go ahead and give me a perception check, DC 15."
Siobhan: [makes a thumbs up] 16.
"Brennan: Incredible. You see, if you direct your eyes to the courtyard, blam, a ladder is lowered from the roof into the courtyard."
Emily: What? There's more fuckers up there?
Zac: Above us?
"Lou: Oh, behind."
"Brennan: Above you guys, it looks like more. Yep."
"Ally: Oh, no."
Brennan: Sofia.
"Emily: Oh wait, the ladder is lowered in, but no one's come down on it yet?"
Brennan: No one's come down on it yet.
Emily: I see.
Siobhan: I tell everybody.
"Brennan: So, you shout out that something has been lowered into the courtyard, but you see the defenders have already sort of, appeared outside here. Sofie, your line of sight to that is being blocked by that coffee cup."
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: That's why you're not seeing who's over there on the roof 'cause there's a big coffee cup in the way blocking your line of sight to the rest of the roof.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Or the top of the cart, I should say. Kingston, that's your turn."
"Lou: Great. If I move to here, can I make a perception check to see what's on top of the roof?"
"Brennan: Yeah, give me a perception check."
Lou: Okay. 16?
Brennan: You look to the top of the roof and see the following things up there. Blam. Two centurions and a large squadron of ants up on the roof.
Lou: Great.
"Emily: And they're looking to get into that courtyard, it seems?"
"Brennan: Yeah, they're looking to go into the monastery and slaughter."
Emily: Okay.
"Lou: Great. I look to Marty and anyone who's around and say,"
"Kingston: Protect the monastery, I'll take care of your friends."
Lou: And I'm gonna cast Mass Cure Wounds.
Zac: Yes.
Emily: Ooh.
"Lou: And that should hit… I'll be able to hit Cody 30 feet, both of the cockroaches, Sofia, you probably won't let me hit. And then I'll also hit… I hit Iga. How many do I hit?"
"Zac: Marty's hurt, I think."
"Lou: Marty, I'll get Marty. I get, We're hitting six people."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Lou: So, you tell me if I can hit Sofia, that's my first question."
Brennan: What's the range on that?
Lou: It's 30.
"Brennan: No. With altitude, no."
Lou: Great.
Brennan: That's the only reason.
Emily: It's for the best. Prioritize others.
"Lou: Hey, I know you want that radiant damage."
[Emily laughs]
"Lou: So, we'll go cockroach, cockroach, Marty if he's hurt, Iga. Are either of the other two cockroaches hurt? And Ricky or Pete, are you hurt? Or Cody. And then either of the other cockroaches or Ricky hurt?"
Zac: I've not been hurt yet.
Lou: Great.
Brennan: One of the other cockroaches is hurt.
Lou: Great.
"Brennan: Obviously the two that are making death saves are very hurt. One of the other two is injured. Marty is injured as well. So, there's four cockroaches you could hit with a Mass Cure Wounds."
"Lou: I'm gonna hit all four of them, Iga, and Cody. That's my six."
Siobhan makes a thumbs up.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Let's see that roll.
"Lou: Okay, you wanna see it? Let's do it. We'll do it for the fans at home."
Siobhan: Do it for the 'gram.
"Lou: Okay, how about that?"
Murph: Okay.
Lou: We'll take that.
Siobhan: That helps.
"Lou: So, it's gonna be 16 plus 5 so 21 to all of them."
"Murph: Nice, thank you."
Kingston: Fall back to the monastery! I guess.
[Emily laughs]
Brennan: Incredible.
"Emily: Does it seem like that was their turns? The centurion, they went on the same turn? Them showing up was their turn."
"Brennan: Yes, it did look like that might've been their turn, yeah."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Kingston, these cockroaches are all back to basically full health. The monks leap up as Kingston (whooshes). They glow with light, and they go,"
"Monks: Thank you, thank you. Hey, it's nice to know the voice of New York even talks for the cockroaches. Thanks, Kingston Brown!"
"Kingston: Hey, if Kugrash isn't around to do it, it is my job."
Brennan: Incredible. Awesome. Any bonus actions or anything else?
Lou: That's where I needed to stand. I think I'm gonna move back. Can I climb onto the mustard wagon?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Lou: Great, I'm just working about ketchup. Yeah."
Brennan: I hear ya.
"Lou: I'll move a little bit under the mustard wagon, duck underneath the bottle top."
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: And that'll be my turn.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Ricky, that's you."
Zac: Okay. I guess Ox is gonna attack the one right in front of me with Pack Tactics.
Brennan: Go for it. Hell yeah.
Zac: Does a 15 hit?
Brennan: 15 exactly hits.
"Zac: Okay. So, that's two D6 plus four."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: So, I did 10 damage to the ant."
Brennan: Awesome.
Zac: And he's still kicking?
"Brennan: Yes, he is still kicking."
Zac: Okay. Ricky's gonna attack the other one first.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: First attack. Does a 20 hit?
Brennan: Absolutely.
Zac: Of course. And I'm going to do first level Divine Smite on that guy.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Zac: That hit. So, that would be… My bad. That's a D8 on top of another D8 for Improved Divine Smite."
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: Plus—
"Brennan: A first level Divine Smite, so this'll be 4d8."
"Zac: 4d8, okay."
Brennan: Plus six.
Zac: Okay. [counting] Seven. Four. That's 18 damage to that guy.
"Brennan: 18, he is not down."
"Zac: Oh, that sucks. Okay. I'm just gonna hit him again."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Does a 17 hit?
"Brennan: Yes, it does."
Zac: I think it does. Okay. I'll just do it again.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Okay, so, seven. That's 12. 19… 25 damage that time."
"Brennan: Obliterated, gone."
Zac: And can I do an object interaction?
Brennan: Sure.
Zac: Can I take out the Peasant Sword?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: And just slide it over to Cody. Like,"
Ricky: Oops.
Brennan: You hear Emily laughing in the background.
Emily isn’t at her laptop.
"Ricky: Hey, Cody."
"Emily: [comes back into frame] [laughing] Sorry, I was listening."
"Ricky: Cody, I don't know, your weapon's pretty cool, I don't know if you feel like using this for a little bit."
Cody: [grateful to the point of tears] Fucking thank you. Fucking thank you. A fucking usable sword. Fuck.
"Murph: Just scrambling out from under a moped and a giant sword, scrambling to get the Peasant Sword."
"Siobhan: Hey, umm, Brennan, would you say that all of this stuff that's happened to Cody today has made him super humble?"
[Brennan and Murph burst out laughing]
Zac: He's been humbled.
Siobhan: I feel like he's been pretty humbled.
"Ally: Yeah, he's pretty humble now."
Murph: Don't give Cody anything.
Ally: He's kinda always been. [takes a sip of water]
Lou: He lost every possession he owns.
"Ally: Yeah, that's some Siddhartha shit."
"Murph: He needs some time to sit in it, though."
Emily: He's literally prone right now.
Murph: He needs to sit in it. He needs to fucking sit in it.
"Brennan: Incredible. Yeah, you know what? 'Cause Cody has been very humbled, but he hasn't been so humbled that the Peasant Sword wouldn't… He needs to be tested by the Peasant Sword not doing anything other than being a sword and see where that leaves him. That's the furthest step. Yeah, Ricky slides a sword that, hey, it works, across to you."
"Murph: Just crying and saying ""Thank you."""
Cody: Fucking thank you. Fuck.
"Zac: And as a bonus action, I'll cast Sanctuary on Cody."
Ally: Aww.
(laughing)
Murph: Fuck.
"Brennan: Amazing, amazing. Iga, that's gonna be you."
Zac: With that humble way.
"Siobhan: Okay. I'm gonna fly up to this Heineken bottle, so I'm on the same level as these ants up here, and I am once again going to cast Shatter, which I think will get all of them and the ladder."
"Brennan: Oh, shit. Okay."
[Lou imitates blasting]
"Brennan: Yep, that looks just about right to me. Okay. The DC on that is once again 17."
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: These guys do get a plus two 'cause of their centurions being nearby. And it's a con save, DC 17."
"Siobhan: It's a con save, yeah."
"Brennan: 14s or higher. Okay. Two of the legionnaires make it. And one of the centurions make it. Yeah, go ahead and roll that damage."
"Siobhan: Here we go, 27. And the ladder takes all of that damage, 27, and then."
Ally: Hell yeah.
Brennan: Holy shit.
Siobhan: The ones that make it take 13.
Brennan: Hold on one second.
"Iga: Thank you, dragon. Thank you, I'm… Thank you. We've gotta sit down at some point and figure out a language of this. Whatever is good for you is good for me. I just wanna make sure you're happy."
"Brennan: Iga, you throw that Shatter down. Boom! Immediately six of the ant legionnaires are rent asunder by the force of your magic, this thunderous smiting, and the ladder shudders, shakes, and splits apart. You have prevented them from being able to drop into the courtyard on their next turn."
Siobhan: Great.
Ally: Yeah.
"Lou: Whoo, whoo, whoo."
"Ally: Nice, nice, nice."
Brennan: Incredible. It is Pete next.
"Ally: Hey. You know I'm gonna pop right here. Oh, right here. Oh, what was it? Right there. Okay, and I'm gonna cast Cone of Cold straight on down. So, that's 60 feet from me. So, I think I get—"
Brennan: Oh my god.
Murph: Woah!
Ally: Everyone.
"Brennan: Yeah, let's just see here real quick because… Well, here's what I'm gonna do real quick for you, my dear dude. If we check this out, we're gonna go… Yeah, if we put an aura on you of 60 feet this will give us an idea of, like… So, that's 60 feet from you in all directions. So, looking at you there, you would hit all of those ants down there and both of the centurions."
Ally: Yes. And then I'm gonna use Careful to not hit Cody.
Brennan: But I think it’s a 45 degree angle cone.
Zac: Oh my god.
"Ally: Oh, sick."
"Brennan: So, I think actually, you can hit the ones around the monk, miss Kingston. But I think the two… So, you've gotta choose, the two on the far right you wouldn't hit. So, you're doing a straight line down from you."
Ally: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: So, if you wanna hit the ones surrounding that cockroach monk—"
"Ally: Mm-hmm. And leave off the two over here? Yeah, I'll do that. I'll hit the four around the cockroach monk and leave those two out."
Brennan: Cool. Go ahead and roll your Cone of Cold. Jesus Christ.
"Ally: Okay. [hums] Okay yeah, it's 8D8."
"Brennan: One, two, three, four."
Lou: Whoo-hoo.
Ally: See some eights in there. See some eights in there.
Emily: Yeah!
"Siobhan: Yes, oh baby, that is high."
Lou: A cool 43.
"Brennan: One, two."
Zac: Ally roll.
"Siobhan: Hell yeah. ♪ Roll, Ally roll. ♪"
[Ally laughs]
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: Con save for half.
"Brennan: Absolutely bonkers. So, the group of five at the far extreme end all make their saves. The farthest legionnaire by the cockroach makes his save as well, and that's everybody who makes their save. So, the two right in front of you do not make their save. The one right as you [whooshes] Cone of Cold of the Dreaming, immediately dead. This next one, immediately dead. Just too close—"
Ally: Hell yeah.
Brennan: —to the source of the cold. This one looks very much on death's door.
Ally: Which one?
"Brennan: No, wait a minute. Even with half, that one is fucking toast. [gasps]"
Zac: Which one was it?
Emily: Wow.
"Brennan: Wait, even with half, they're fucking toast. It's the cockroaches that have 22. The ants only have 20, which with a 43, oh god."
Ally: Fuck yes.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Blam."
"Ally: I'm like,"
Pete: This is for Cody!
[Brennan laughs]
Cody: Please don't do anything for me. Fuck.
"Pete: Dude, come on, I've never seen anything like that, man. Let me gas you back up."
Cody: When I farted and fell off my fucking moped?
"Pete: Yeah, dude, yeah."
Brennan: Unbelievable.
[Murph laughs]
Cody: And then I scrambled crying to the sword that Ricky threw me?
"Pete: Hey, no one saw that. No one saw that but me, don't worry. And Ricky."
Cody: So many ants—
"Ricky: I saw it, Ox saw it."
Cody: Ricky saw it.
Ricky: I think these cockroaches saw it.
Cody: The cockroaches definitely saw.
"Brennan: You see, yeah, these dudes fall back. Marty falls back in the monastery knowing that there were people up on the roof. He scoots back. And Sofia, that's your turn."
Emily: Okay. How many feet up are we?
"Brennan: At your proportion, you are the equivalent of about a 40-foot drop."
"Emily: Okay, only 40 feet, okay. So, pushing them over isn't gonna kill them. And then I'm looking over at… I can't see because of the coffee cup. Well, Iga has shouted out that shit was fucked up over there. Can I peek around the coffee cup, see… Do I sense that this gaggle that I've interrupted, were they going to where that ladder was gonna be, or is there another entrance in the coffee cup, or something?"
Brennan: It looks like they were the rear guard of the ants that were going up and over to infiltrate the courtyard.
Emily: Okay. And the ants that are going to infiltrate the courtyard do not currently have a system—
"Brennan: To do that, correct."
"Emily: To do that. All right, then. I'm just gonna go ahead and attack the sentinel in front of me."
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
"Emily: That's definitely gonna hit, hold on. 26 to hit."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, that'll do it."
Emily: That's 12 damage. Stunning Strike.
"Brennan: Stunning Strike, fails, he is stunned."
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna leave him stunned then, and I'm gonna start going for… And I'm gonna go for the… Sorry, I was over here."
"Brennan: Oh, yeah, yeah."
Emily: And I'm gonna go for one of these guys that's on the ledge.
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: That's a 23 to hit.
Brennan: 23 hits.
"Emily: So, I'm gonna do 12 damage to him."
Brennan: Ooh!
"Emily: And then, can I Flurry of Blows? If I Flurry of Blows, can I use one of those attacks to push him over the edge?"
"Brennan: Yes, you absolutely can."
"Emily: Okay. So, I'm gonna Flurry of Blows. I think that's maybe gonna miss. Does a 15 hit?"
Brennan: 15 hits. But actually—
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: This is actually just your athletics. So, you're just gonna add your athletics to this."
"Emily: It's actually the same, so it's 15."
"Brennan: 15 either way. These dudes are not super strong. So, I'm gonna roll in front of the board. This dude needs to hit a 14 or higher to not get pushed."
"Emily: Okay, then I'll go after him again."
"Brennan: Okay, go ahead and roll that athletics."
Emily: That time it's gonna be 22.
Brennan: He needs a nat 20. Does not happen for him.
Ally: Yeah!
"Emily: Okay, so then won't he take 4d6 damage?"
"Siobhan: Woah, that roll."
Murph: Nice. Perfect.
"Brennan: You knock homebody right off the fucking ledge and he goes, [yells] as you, [shouts] kick him off the ledge, splats into the ground, and is gone."
"Emily: Okay, cool. Not the most efficient, but I just thought it'd be fun."
"Brennan: It is very fun. You're having a battle and you're fending off an entire squadron of ants on the top of the hotdog cart. That's Sofia. These monks prepare. These monks begin to fall back into their own monastery, following Kingston's advice. These two are gonna go after this last dude here. And this dude has… Oh, this guy's only four hit points away. Blam, that guy is gone. And these two cockroach monks say,"
Cockroaches: We're falling back to the monastery!
"Brennan: As they run back. Ant centurion goes. These guys are all still incapacitated. This lone centurion looks up, sees this fall here. I'm gonna go ahead… Kingston, you said you're standing on top of the mustard cart, right?"
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: I'm gonna roll a wisdom saving throw, and I want it to be opposed by an intimidate check from Kingston. Let me go ahead and roll their wisdom saving throw, which is only a plus three. Okay, 18. Go ahead and roll an intimidate check from Kingston for me."
"Lou: Great. Well, you want it on the board, or can I do it at home?"
Brennan: Whichever you think you would prefer from Kingston.
Lou: I'd like to do it at home.
Brennan: Do it at home.
"Lou: So, I roll intimidate with advantage. It's a plus seven."
"Brennan: So, one of these needs to be an 11 or higher."
Lou: First one is a 10. Second one. Is another 10.
"Brennan: Ugh, brutal."
Lou: Two 10s.
"Brennan: Two 10s. So, two 17s. These centurions go,"
"Centurions: Forward, forward, forward!"
Brennan: These ones are going to rush through difficult terrain to go in close with Sofia. This one here is going to fall back to the ketchupult and give it advantage on its next attack. The centurion's gonna make attacks on Sofia. Hits.
Emily: Which centurion? He's stunned.
"Brennan: The one that's stunned and can't attack you, nevermind."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: [laughs] Cool. Those are the centurions. Ketchupult is going to go. Pete and Cody, give me dex saving throws."
"Zac: Is it with advantage, or no?"
"Murph: Oh, do I have—"
Brennan: If you're not wielding the sword you no longer have the disadvantage.
"Murph: I am prone, though, right?"
Brennan: Yes.
"Murph: Ricky did give me Sanctuary. Does that give me advantage, so it equals out and it's—"
Zac: I wasn't sure if they got advantage because of the Hypnotic Pattern on the people in the thing.
"Brennan: Sorry. You're actually just gonna roll a standard… He's canceling out the disruption of the machine. So, you just roll a straight dexterity saving throw."
Ally: I got a 19.
Murph: I got a 25.
"Brennan: You each take seven points of acid damage as you are hit with another ketchup splatter. Cody, it is your turn."
"Murph: Oh, boy. Okay."
Ally: Just try one more time.
(Murph laughs)
"Ally: I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding."
Murph: I look at the mess that I have made.
[Emily laughs]
"Murph: I need to just think for like… I need things to slow down so I can just sit in my room for like, a week. Cool, okay. So, we've got all these dudes down here. The ketchupult, the only working one is the one down here, right?"
Brennan: Correct.
"Murph: I'm trying to click it. Yeah, it's the one at the bottom of the screen. I don't think there's really any way I can get up to Sofie. I don't think we need to fall back to the monastery, right? It seems like nobody's getting in there."
"Lou: They're all gonna come, yeah."
"Murph: Okay. I guess the only way I can really be useful here is, I guess I will take the Peasant Sword, and I guess I'm… I don't want anyone to get the Questing Blade, so I bring it with me."
Siobhan: Nobody can pick up the Questing Blade.
"Pete: I'll watch it, dude. I'll watch it, dude."
"Cody: Are you sure? Pete, you have to promise me you won't lose it."
"Pete: I'll watch it, I'm not gonna lose it."
"Cody: Okay. I feel like I can't leave it, it's fucked up. I'm gonna carry it. I need to— This is my burden to bear."
"Murph: I bring it with me, but I'm not gonna use it, and then I will go after this guy down here."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Go ahead and give me an attack roll.
"Murph: And Cody just takes a regular-ass swing. But first, he'll do bonus action, Thunderous Smite."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: That is a 19 to hit.
"Brennan: 19 hits, baby."
"Murph: Great. So, if I'm holding it with two hands, is it a d10?"
"Brennan: Yes, it is."
Murph: Great. Cody will do a… Why not? Let's try to get rid of a dude. I'll do a third level Divine Smite.
Brennan: Ooh!
Murph: Rolling on the damage.
Lou: [gently] Rolling on the damage.
Murph: 42 damage.
[everyone oohs in unison]
"Brennan: You moped up. Cody, you are bleeding, your jeans, your shitty jeans that a construction worker gave you on the street—"
Murph: They're so big.
Brennan: Are ripped.
Murph: And not in a cool JNCOs way.
Murph: Not in a cool JNCOs way.
Siobhan: Ride up in the crotch.
"Brennan: You ride up on the moped and this sword is just old and rusty. You ride up and it moves so fast in your hand. You swing and decapitate with a blast of lightning, (whooshes) and decapitate this centurion. Dead."
"Murph: Sweet. Cody absolutely resists the urge to do a stupid flourish, and he just swings, and he catches himself and he shakes to stop himself, and then he will take a second swing on… There's another guy right there, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, there is."
"Murph: Yeah, I'll swing on the other guy."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Ooh, that's a 19 to hit."
Brennan: 19 hits.
"Murph: Cool. I will do a second level… Or, I'll do another third level."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: I wanna mess these dudes up. Okay. So, this one will be a little bit less 'cause I don't have the thunderous. Okay."
"Brennan: 23\. Hell yeah. You slash this other, (yells) this ant commander. The last commander left over by this final ketchupult. After that, the legionnaires around are going to rush you, Cody. It's gonna be one, two—"
Zac: He does have Sanctuary.
"Brennan: Oh, shit."
"Murph: Yeah, I have Sanctuary 'cause of Ricky."
Brennan: Does Sanctuary continue to work if the person with it is being violent?
Zac: Let me double check. I don't know.
"Brennan: Three, yeah, definitely three of them surround you, even if they don't do anything else."
"Zac: Oh yeah, if the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, the spell ends. I see. Interesting."
"Brennan: One, two, three. Cody, your AC's 12 right now, right?"
"Murph: Yes, there's the, uh..."
Brennan: You take 12 slashing damage.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: And then you take seven piercing damage. Give me a con save.
Murph: Okay. Come on. 17.
"Brennan: Cool, you are safe."
Murph: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Sofia, what's your armor class right now?"
Emily: 19.
"Brennan: 19, cool. 14 attacks coming your way."
Zac: Oh my god.
Ally: Wow!
Siobhan: Jesus.
Brennan: That is a hit.
Emily: I guess I'm gonna Shield again. I'll do my second Shield.
Murph: You've got to.
Brennan: That brings your AC up to 24.
Emily: Uh-huh.
"Brennan: Sofia is a tornado. Is literally in that, like, martial artist of, completely unarmed, surrounded on all sides by people trying as hard as they can to hit her and cannot land a single blow. What a dream. These two that are all but forgotten about, sneak over and begin to charge into the monastery. That's as far as they get. They're going through difficult terrain. Kingston, it is your turn."
Lou: Is there any chance I can use my action to make the same intimidation check as before?
Brennan: Yes. Go for it. But I'm gonna let them keep their good roll of an 18.
"Lou: That's perfectly fine. Yeah, I'll climb on top of the mustard wagon."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Lou: Yeah, we'll climb up here. Okay, here we go. I'll roll 'em, let's try this thing."
Lou rolls a 6 on Roll20.
"Lou: Okay, not any better."
Brennan: Six.
Lou: Here we go.
Brennan: Last one.
Lou rolls a nat 20.
Brennan: Nat!
Ally: Yes!
"Lou: Yes, okay."
Brennan: 20.
Zac: Yes.
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: Un-freaking-believable. Kingston, you get to the top of this shattered mustard wagon. Iga has just been raining down Dragon's Thunder, destroying their siege weaponry. Pete has unleashed fire and ice. Oh by the way, Pete… No, you know what? We'll come to you in a second, Pete."
Ally’s eyes widen.
"Brennan: Sofia is on top of the cart, looking over the vast valley of the monastery. (imitates banging) Grabbing swords, their commander's still stunned, and Cody's just beheaded one of their commanders. You look to your side, the closest ally you have is still Ricky and Ox over here. A bunch of them are incapacitated still by Ricky's picnic vision to the south. What does Kingston say to the ants here on the hotdog cart?"
"Lou: I climb to the top of this thing and I'm just like,"
"Kingston: [thundering] Begone, ants! You face the disciples of Kugrash, also known as Rat Jesus. You stand on sacred ground, and will meet only death!"
"Brennan: A booming voice erupts, the monastery shimmers, and on the breeze you feel a little dance. [does the Kugrash dance]"
Lou: Aww.
[Emily laughs]
Murph: Oh my god.
Murph and Zac join in on the dance.
Ally: Aww.
Iga: That's a good dance he's doing. How do you do this? How do you do this? [tries the dance]
Ricky: It's pretty straightforward.
"Pete: Iga, you're doing great. Maybe a little bit more."
Iga: I'll teach my kids for TikTok. They love their fashionable dances.
"Brennan: On a nat 20 intimidation… On a nat 20 intimidation, the ants begin to sound a retreat. The two ants in the monastery drop their weapons and surrender. The ones next to Sofia drop their weapons and surrender. And honestly… Yeah, these ants drop their weapons, surrender, and the battle is concluded."
Ally: Ooh.
"Brennan: Incredible. Pete, for those last two spells you cast, though, go ahead and give me Wild Magic rolls. You're on one through six right now."
Ally: Interesting. It's a 14.
Brennan: One through seven.
Ally: It's a 17.
Siobhan: Wow.
Lou gives a salute.
Brennan: Pete is on one through eight—
Emily: It would've been good to have it happen—
Brennan: Which is the highest I think Pete's ever gotten.
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: You see that the ants fall, surrender, you hear the blowing of horns off in the distance. A white flag is waved around. The ants in the distance retreat, these ones surrender. More cockroaches that are non-combatants come out of the monastery. Marty comes over to you and says,"
"Marty: Holy moly, you guys saved our monastery. Thank you so much!"
Ricky: It's a beautiful place. We could never let anything happen to it.
"Marty: It's all right, it's a shitty old hotdog cart, just like Rat Jesus would want."
Pete: [laughs] That's actually true.
"Sofia: I think he'd be really proud, yeah. He'd really like this."
"Brennan: All of you are brought in. You see that the monks wait that night, and actually show tremendous courtesy and hospitality to these prisoners that not a moment before were attacking their monastery. And you see these ants shaken by this show of sacred generosity and of turning of the other cheek, as Rat Jesus maybe would instruct, we don't know. The monks take you in. A long feasting table made out of a bunch of playing cards put on little pizza stands, those little pizza stand mini tables."
Zac: Yes!
[Lou laughs]
Emily: Aww.
Ally: Cute.
"Brennan: You see they say,"
"Cockroach: Come and feast with us. We got a bunch of trash, some dog shit, I don't know, fuck it."
Sofia: I'm sorry. Do cockroaches eat dog shit?
"Cockroach: I don't know. Hey, we got hotdogs, too. You want hotdogs?"
Ricky: I'd eat a hotdog.
Iga: How long has this hotdog been here?
Cody: I would definitely eat a hotdog.
Iga: Two years? Five years?
Emily: Can I do an insight on if the oil that the hotdogs are boiled in is clean or not?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it. It's perception."
Siobhan: I'll give her help on this.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: Okay, good. That's a 13."
Brennan: 13?
"Emily: Oh wait, it's perception?"
Brennan: Perception.
Emily: That's a 17.
Brennan: Any of you will be incredibly sick if you eat any of this food.
Zac: If you're immune to disease?
Brennan: If you're immune to disease—
Siobhan: I pull a hotdog out of Cody's hands right as he's about to—
Cody: Fuck. The ones at the gas station aren't any better.
[cast laughs]
"Iga: That is not the reason to eat these, that is the reason to not eat the gas station hotdogs."
Cody: That’s actually super interesting.
[Ally and Emily laugh]
"Brennan: I think Ricky and Cody being immune to disease, you guys will probably be okay. But, yeah—"
"Sofia: That does explain your diet, Cody, that you're immune to disease."
[Siobhan laughs]
Cody: Yeah.
"Brennan: But you sit down. You see that one of them pops a massive towering can of soda, and that you know which is in a can would never go bad, so at least you guys can have drinks here. You are holding globes of fizzy soda in your hand 'cause the surface tension is high enough to [slurps]."
The Dream Team sip drops of soda.
"Kingston: This is fun. I honestly, I enjoy this. This is—"
Ricky: I haven't had soda in seven years.
[cast laughs]
Siobhan: Ricky is high.
Brennan: Yeah.
Siobhan: Ricky's pupils are like.
Ricky: Wow.
"Pete: Hey, Ricky."
Ricky: Hmm?
Pete: Can you lift the blade? Can you lift the Thirsting Blade?
Murph: Oh my god.
Pete: Are you that hopped up?
"Ricky: I'll give it a shot if that's just something, I don't know."
Murph: I hand it to Ricky.
Pete: I'm interested.
Zac: What is the check?
Murph: It's a DC 15 athletics check.
Emily: It's a 15 athletics.
Zac: Okay.
Ally: You're just so strong.
Siobhan: Truly so easy for Ricky.
"Zac: Yeah, I got a 13 plus nine."
[cast bursts out laughing]
Brennan: Yeah. It goes straight up.
Zac: Pick it up.
"Ricky: Okay, that's enough—"
Pete: Just wanted to see that. That's pretty sick.
Ricky: I'm a little nervous touching it.
"Brennan: Yeah, so Cody, you look at Thirsting Blade, Dark Excalibur, Mega Genesis, and now you also have the Peasant Sword here with you. What's going on with Cody here at the cockroaches' table real quick?"
"Murph: Oh, man. I think Cody has been thinking a lot, but I think it's just been a day since… When was when they were in the dream world? That was yesterday?"
"Brennan: Yeah, exactly."
"Murph: So, he's had his whole fucking world rocked in a day. I think he goes over to Ricky and he goes,"
"Cody: Hey, dude, do you wanna… I know these other guys can't handle these hotdogs, but do you wanna go have a bad hotdog in the corner? 'Cause I just wanna chat for a sec."
"Ricky: Yeah, technically I'm making today a cheat day as well, so."
"Cody: Good, cool."
Zac: Ricky has also put actual sized corks on the end of all the blades.
[cast laughs]
Ricky: This thing is devastatingly unsafe.
"Cody: Yeah, no, I fucking stabbed myself during the fight."
"Ricky: Sure, yeah."
"Cody: But yeah, listen, I've been thinking a lot since yesterday, and what we were talking about with the katanas and the stuff with JJ getting back the cultural artifacts and everything and me fucking up this ancient sword so bad, and I'm just… I'm a fake sword guy, man. I don't actually know fucking anything. All of my references are third or fourthhand fucking bastardized versions of everything. So, I still don't know anything. I'm sorry for acting like I was a fucking expert on this stuff. You and fucking everybody else has been nothing but super cool to me, and you tried to fucking teach me to be a paladin and all I cared about was fucking aesthetics and shit. And when all you care about is the aesthetics and everything, you fucking lose the history of everything. Not just Gladiator being this supernatural force, it's people doing fucking shitty dumb shit and not knowing anything and acting like they know stuff. I'm the problem. This is the fucking dream stuff going into the fucking real world, man. My sword sucks ass and it's my fault, and I'm sorry for being a fucking dick to you. I'm really fucking sorry."
"Ricky: Yeah. Well, apology accepted. I think that you really covered it. Like you said, swords are cool, but it's also, like you said, cool to know where it came from and respect that. I think that's awesome. Thanks, dude."
"Cody: Totally. No, thank you."
Ricky: Cheers.
"Cody: Cheers to the hotdogs, man. And I know you're more of an axe guy than a sword guy, but I would like to fix the Questing Blade 'cause I fucked that up, I think I can fix it, and I think you really deserve whatever fucking magic is hidden in this."
Murph: And I wanna give him back the Peasant Sword.
"Ricky: Oh. Well, gosh, I mean, why don't you hang on to it for now? 'Cause who knows how…"
"Zac: I think Ricky actually likes holding onto the axe. I think that's more ideal for him at the moment. I don't think Cody has to use the sword or not, but I think—"
"Cody: No, I'm cool. I just honestly feel fucked up that we just had this whole conversation and you just gave me a sword. So, that was just—"
"Ricky: Hey, I'm just not gonna use it right now, so if you wanna hang on to that until you figure out what's going on with the Questing Blade."
"Cody: Okay, I'll fix the Questing Blade, but I very much appreciate the Peasant Sword, and I am going to do my best to become a real actual fucking sword guy."
Ricky: Hell yeah.
Murph: I eat a hotdog.
"Brennan: Cody, you hear Bazathrax in your chest go,"
"Bazathrax: Dude, I heard what you were saying. I think we could fix the Questing Blade by adding the Peasant Sword in there. I think the problem is there's not enough swords. Do quadruple sword."
Cody: The power of the quadruple sword.
Emily: Essentially a comb.
"Murph: A comb! Cody thinks about the potential of the quadruple blade for a moment and goes,"
"Cody: No, I cannot give in."
"Ricky: Hey, Cody, what are you thinking about?"
"Cody: The devil inside me is trying to tell me to add a fourth sword to the Questing Blade, but I know that that's a fucking stupid idea."
"Ricky: Probably not a good idea, right?"
"Cody: Yeah, that's a fucking stupid idea."
"Ricky: The problem wasn't that it wasn't heavy enough, right? Or that it doesn't have enough blades."
"Cody: Paladin lesson number one, you don't need more than one fucking blade on your sword. Just the one is fine. 'Cause my sword was fine before, right? I was doing pretty good."
Ricky: Picture me as another tattoo on your back.
[Brennan and Emily laugh]
"Ricky: Instead of an angel and a devil on each shoulder, it's a chest piece and a back piece that I guess both say ""Redemption""."
Cody: Interesting.
[cast cracks up]
"Cody: That's fucking rad, Ricky. That sounds fucking awesome. I'm gonna get that. I'm gonna get ""Redemption"" on my back as well."
Ally: Holy shit.
Ricky: You don't have to. It seems like you don't have any money.
"[Emily, Siobhan, and Murph laugh]"
"Cody: Yeah, wow, I'm fucked. Fuck, yeah. Shit, well yeah, thanks."
Ricky: Cool.
"Cody: Thanks, man."
"Brennan: Amazing. As Cody and Ricky bond over in the corner, you see Marty says,"
"Marty: Wow, really happy to have you. Yeah, if you need the three of us to reach out to Kugrash, we'd be happy to do that for you, no problem. Whenever you all want that to happen, it can happen. But we can reach out to him, you know? It means a lot that you found us, and I can feel it in myself after you activated that, Ricky, that part of you was keeping that alive, that there are things that have gone missing from New York. And sometimes they go missing. Things can always change and be different, but it's good to pass the torch, so to speak."
"Ricky: Yeah, and I think it feels like you're doing great work down here. We can all just try to keep Rat Jesus in our hearts."
"Marty: Yeah, that's exactly what you gotta do."
"Brennan: For all of you that are sitting here as well, you have this incredible thing. Kingston, you look down at that egg in your arms."
Emily: Have we seen the egg yet?
Brennan: No—
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: I think… Yeah, go."
Emily: You're allowed to be private—
"Lou: I just did the whole fight with the egg. [laughs] Lightning Bolt, egg. No."
Zac: It's like a Heisman Trophy.
"Lou: [laughs] Exactly. Mass Cure Wounds, egg."
[Ally laughs]
"Lou: No, yeah. What's going on with the egg, Brennan?"
"Brennan: Kingston, I would say, if Kingston wants to roll an insight or a perception, he's welcome to do so."
"Lou: Oh, big time. Great. That's gonna be a 21 insight."
"Brennan: I think Kingston is just feeling… With a 21 insight, you're just feeling very protective of this right now. And I think an insight check would allow you to understand, this being is an egg, and you're like, “This is a dragon's egg, I saw this come out of a thing.” And then you're like, “Oh, but look at how beautiful and cool it looks.” And with a 21 insight, you also, I think, realize that this egg chose to fight for New York. It could feel the raw Umbra seeping through the chest. It could feel that… Everything in Iga's castle is all about the history of Iga's family, and everything in that dragon is about the ancient world, and rightfully so. Dragons have been about, seem to be, magically associated with the past. But you think about all the things you never learned about the Dragon of Bleecker Street and how special it was for a place that, on the scale of the world, is relatively new, to have a spirit that was helping itself. And you think about those New York minutes flashing and how fast this city goes and how easy it is to get distracted, and you think about the fact that someone somewhere keeping a track of the story of all these people matter. You think about Pete learning about the past Vox Phantasmi, and you realize, you've never once put a lot of thought into who the past Vox Populi were. There were people just like you who fought important fights for the people of this city, and I don't think Kingston knows their stories. And you know that the Dragon of Bleecker Street would have."
"Lou: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I think Kingston is starting to ask those… Like you're saying, is asking… I don't know, there's the opportunity, he's thinking about, I don't know, all of the time he spent as… I don't know, I guess endings and beginnings. I think the beginning of his journey as the Vox Populi, but that being the end of the Dragon of Bleecker Street, and then this being the beginning of a new dragon. And I don't know, all of the time he has spent being the Vox. And I don't know, I guess, yeah, there is a little bit of historical significance with regard to his own place. Yeah, he doesn't know anything outside of himself with regard to his time in this role."
"Brennan: I think as Kingston also is thinking of endings and beginnings… This is the tail end of that insight check, but there's also a question that would occur to Kingston about, this thing is powerful, and you don't wanna disrespect a spirit, but this thing has already done a lot to save your city from Null, from what is beyond. But you're also, part of you is like, this is a fucking kid. Isn't that what this is? An egg is a kid, there's a kid in here."
Lou: Yeah.
Brennan: And maybe there's some unfairness or protectiveness around a thing that's already doing more than its fair share.
"Lou: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think this is just one more reason why this fight is so much more important, and why Gladiator's gonna fuckin' die."
[Brennan laughs]
"Lou: I think Kingston just menacingly rubs the egg knowing that the New York that it grows up in is not going to be one defined by this company, and its empty wants and its empty homes."
Ally: Wow.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You feel a coursing power. And I don't even know if Kingston notices. I think for the others there, like Sofia and Pete and Iga, you guys notice a meditation from Kingston on this egg and feel that sense of power growing. So, you guys have accomplished a fair amount. You guys have accomplished all of your short-term goals, you've located these spirits. The question becomes, you know that, weirdly, the box ended up being a huge unexpected victory because there were these two tools to fight the power of emptiness and isolation and the power of forgetting, both in terms of forgotten people because now you have a way of contacting Kugrash and getting some of that wisdom and power, and of forgotten times and stories through this powerful Dragon's egg that you now hold. So, with the horror of fleeing from Nod, you have quickly, in the span of a day, turned that into assembling a group of tools here on the side of the waking world, and I don't think are feeling… Something horrifying is happening on the other side of the barrier between waking and dreaming, but you have got way more tools on the side you're on than you had a day ago. You look at the feast concluding, and I guess the question is, whether you guys want to push to try and get these three totems and summon Kugrash as soon as possible, or whether you feel an instinct to wait longer to do that. But you guys are all at the feasting table as the night wears on. Marty is off ministering to the other cockroaches."
"Marty: Hey, feel free to stay as long as you want. The trains run all night."
"Kingston: Great, thank you, Marty."
"Pete: Thank you, Marty."
Ricky: What do we think? Feels like a big moment.
Kingston: Right?
"Sofia: Yeah. It feels like, I personally don't know quite yet what we're gonna ask of Kugrash, personally."
"Ricky: Yeah, what would we ask him?"
Sofia: Does anyone have a clear idea of what? Or should we wait?
"Ricky: If Kugrash is… I'm just thinking out loud. If Kugrash has become sort of, he ate the everything bagel and he's everything and Null wants to be nothing, is there a question there? I don't have the actual question, but."
"Sofia: But I guess, is it a question as much as, do we summon him in a moment that we need everything?"
[everyone ooh’s]
Ricky: Maybe we can ask him if that makes sense to him.
"Kingston: Yeah, it seems like the cockroaches will give us the ability to ask questions—"
"Sofia: Oh, it's not a one-time thing."
"Kingston: And then bring in the gang together, I think might be some kind of larger, more momentous."
"Sofia: I see, I thought it was a one-time thing. Okay, yeah, I guess let's… Then, okay."
Ricky: Do we do it?
"Kingston: Yeah, you guys want?"
Ricky: I'm down.
"Kingston: I feel like, let's talk to Marty."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Sofia, so, you all go and approach. Marty looks at you and says,"
"Marty: Yeah, if you wanna try to commune with the Sacred Rat, with Rat Jesus, come be our guest."
"Brennan: He gestures to some beautiful spaces that used to be lined with napkins and are now huge metal shelves where you see cockroaches sitting in meditation on the power of the Sacred Rat. I don't know if everyone here would attempt individually to approach this. I mean, Sofia, you know meditation very, very well at this point. So, you can absolutely attempt it, but whatever it is that people wanna do, they can do here."
Murph: I guess Cody doesn't totally know what's going on.
[Zac laughs]
Murph: So I think he'll just—
"Siobhan: Yeah, same."
Murph: I think he'll just help—
"Ricky: Come on, Cody."
Murph: Sofie.
"Cody: Ah, shit."
Brennan: Cool.
"Sofia: I mean, like I said, I don't totally know what to ask. Does anyone have a specific question I should ask Kug? Or should I just say, ""Hey,"" if we think it's not a one-time thing, and give him the lay of the land."
Zac: How did it work when he asked the bagel? I wonder if it's… I don't know if it's the same.
Brennan: When he—
Emily: I don't recall.
"Brennan: When he ate the bagel, he became omniscient."
"Siobhan: So, maybe he will know a way to take out this Null."
"Brennan: I think that that is probably… What occurs to you guys is, bringing those… 'Cause the cockroaches here meditate to get just glimpses of Kugrash. If you were to bring all three totems together, you could bring Kugrash's will, or a fraction of his attention back here to this present moment, 'cause Kugrash is existing throughout all time, although time is, as we know, partially being collapsed right now, but Kugrash exists infinitely in all directions, so it's about taking this eternal thing and directing its attention and focus back to this present moment, which is what those spirits would potentially be able to do. But if Sofia just wants to reach out on her own, the monks here do get glimpses, so it's like, if you wanted to check in, you could do that, but if you wanted a big thing, like what do we do to defeat Null? That would probably be gathering the totems together to be able to do that."
Zac: Gotcha.
"Emily: Okay, then I guess let's do that, right?"
Lou: Yeah.
Zac: Yeah. Does it cost us anything to just try to catch a glimpse?
"Emily: No, I could try to do that."
"Zac: 'Cause I think the other one, we would have to round everyone up, right? It seems like."
"Brennan: Sounds like it, yeah."
"Zac: Since we're here, I don't know, I would."
"Pete: I mean, we might as well kinda lowkey pray to him, or just let him know what's on our mind."
"Kingston: Yeah, I'll take his blessing."
Sofia: Why don't we all pray to Rat Jesus?
Ricky: Yeah.
Kingston: Yeah.
Pete: Yeah.
Sofia: Let's all get in on it.
Kingston: I'll take a moment.
Ricky: Prayer to Rat Jesus.
Murph: Cody will take a pamphlet.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: He's at a crossroads.
"Marty: Hey, we printed this on leaves and fuckin' old store paper bags and shit. It says what we believe."
"Cody: Look at the way I'm dressed right now. I'm just a mismatch of everything, so this is—"
"Marty: Yeah, you dress like a cool guy."
Cody: Thank you so much.
Marty: Yeah.
"Brennan: All of you… I'm gonna say, everyone here, go ahead, we'll make a group Wisdom check. Everyone go ahead and give me a Wisdom check."
Ally: 15.
"Siobhan: God, I rolled another nat 1."
"Brennan: Oh, no."
Murph: I think—
Siobhan: All I've been doing is rolling nat 1s.
Murph: Cody—
Brennan: Yeah?
Zac: What check?
"Murph: Cody has a minus two to wisdom, so I think Cody is just gonna try to be respectful, but also he's just closing his eyes and mouthing things, but not actually praying 'cause he doesn't know what's going on."
[Brennan and Emily laugh]
Ally: Great.
Emily: I got a 17.
Brennan: 17.
Zac: Me too.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: 15.
Brennan: 15 from Pete.
Lou: I got a 13.
Brennan: 13.
"Siobhan: Does that make it? 'Cause if it doesn't, I'll use a luck point."
Brennan: What did Iga get?
Siobhan: I rolled a nat 1.
Brennan: Nat 1? Nat 1's not gonna do it.
"Siobhan: No, but isn't it a group wisdom check?"
"Brennan: Oh, yes, yes, yes, it is a group Wisdom check. Yeah, all of you… Yes, actually, the four people that knew Kugrash in life push you all. You are floating in liminal space. Kingston and Pete, you both look at each other and realize from your expressions, neither of you are in your home realm right now. You're not in the Dreaming and you're not in New York anymore. A placid surface of dark water extends everywhere. You encounter a very different kind of emptiness here. This is the opposite of whatever Null is, this is quiet, serenity. It's the realization that when you are calm and focused, you're still connected to everything because you are, yourself, a part of the tapestry of infinity. No more or no less than all of the things that sum to creation. Ricky and Sofia, I think you two rolled the highest. What are each of you remembering about Kugrash in this moment?"
"Zac: Him saying stuff like, ""Ah, shit, we're all gonna die,"" like that sort of vibe."
[Brennan and Murph laugh]
Zac: Curmudgeonly helping.
Brennan nods.
"Emily: I already mentioned it, but I think I just see a montage of him waking me up with breakfast sandwiches while I'm passed out in the trash, and yeah, and just hanging out with me when no one else would."
"Brennan: You feel an incredible presence here. You are moving through this space. As you move through this [whooshing] void, and actually come to be perfectly still. Murph, I'm gonna throw you a curveball."
Murph: Okay.
Zac: Cody steps up.
Emily: [laughs] Cody is the reincarnation of Kugrash.
"Brennan: Murph, infinite points of light appear from the warm and welcoming darkness and begin to coalesce as something infinite and eternal chooses to make itself finite in order to show how much it loves those things which move in space and time. What do your friends see as this image of Kugrash reconstitutes? And what does a fraction of the eternal and sacred rat say as it arrives?"
"Murph: I think you see… It looks like a constellation, lights like stars that form a giant rat, but you can smell on the wind that he smells like trash and shit."
[Emily and Siobhan laugh]
Ally shakes their head.
"Murph: This is not just a constellation, not just stars."
Ricky: My eyes are burning.
Sofia: This is a sensitive time of smell for me.
"Murph: And then I think… Sorry, did you say you wanted me to say something, too?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Murph: Okay. And then I think Kug goes, in a booming voice, goes,"
"Kugrash: Hey, what's going on, guys? Just kidding, I know what's going on, it's pretty fucking bad out there, huh?"
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: And that's all for this episode of ""The Unsleeping City"". Tune in next week as we say hello to an old friend. Bye-bye!"
Ally: Oh my god.
Lou: Wow.
Emily: Yes!
Lou: Look at that.
"Murph: Oh man, it's fun to be Kugrash again."
"Ally: Oh, that's so funny. Yeah!"

"[lo-fi beats to roll to, aka The Unsleeping City theme]"
"Brennan: Hello, one and all, and welcome to another thrilling episode of Dimension 20, The Unsleeping City. I am your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Lovely, lovely lovely. Gang, last we left off, the champions of New York City found themselves on top of a rusty old hot dog cart helping a group of cockroach monks defend their monastery, the Monastery of the Sacred Rat, a temple devoted to the monastic contemplation of the divine mysteries of Rat Jesus, AKA Kugrash, AKA Bruce Kugrich. However, their monastery was beset by legions of ants. Thankfully, the champions of New York City were able to defend the monastery and find the third missing spirit of New York City, Marty the juicy cockroach, who, in addition to Perry the pigeon and the unicorn of the Cloisters, comprise the three spirits whom Kugrash called upon for his druidic powers all the way back in the 90s, after these three spirits were created and set in place to look after the overlooked and forgotten of New York by the Dragon of Bleecker Street, who chose another champion other than these three spirits in a young Kingston Brown back in the 90s. Also, this day, by the way, this day is the Sunday after Thanksgiving, which is how much has happened in the past couple of days. You guys also went into Nod, where Pete the Vox Phantasma named Null, the entity of isolation, erasure, and forgetting that is moving like vast cosmic void upon the sixth borough and New York City itself. Pete named Null, provoking its attack but also giving you guys a way to understand it and fight it, at the same time as Iga took Kingston into her chest and discovered the secret at the heart of her family's mythic castle, the dragon Smoczmatka, who had been imprisoned there for centuries, and Iga chose to free the dragon, ending 1,200 years of this warlock's dominion over this being. In addition, an egg was discovered that was the rambunctious egg who had been changing the surface of the chest in the first place, and this beautiful, gilded, graffiti covered egg was given to Kingston Brown to safeguard. At the end of last session, you guys went up onto one of the old napkin shelves in the top of the hot dog cart, you guys are all still very itty bitty, and communed with the eternal rat himself, and, scintillating in starlight and smelling like pure shit, Kugrash appeared. And that's where we're gonna pick up our game. The six of you look forward and see the constellation of stars comprising a fraction of the infinite essence of Kugrash. What do you do as you behold your infinite old friend?"
Sofia: Kug? Can you hear us?
"Kugrash: Of course I can hear you, Sof. I would ask you how it's going, but I know how it's going, and, uh, yeah."
"Sofia: Okay! Well, I guess I don't know how you're doing. How are you?"
"Kugrash: I'm, you know, everything. Good, bad, shitty, great, awesome, terrible, just everything at once. It's awesome by the definition of awesome, you know what I mean? So I'm doing awesome, but in, like, the regular way."
"Sofia: Some awe, yeah."
"Kugrash: Yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure."
"Sofia: Well, it's good to hear your voice."
Kugrash: Yeah.
"Ricky: We got to go, we're gonna… No."
[all laugh]
"Kugrash: Yeah, no, it was good catching up, it was good catching up."
"Sofia: Kug, we came here because we're trying to, there's a new threat. Obviously you know, it feels stupid to give any sort of exposition to you, but we came here because of that-"
"Kugrash: No, you know, I know a lot of stuff, but I never know, you know, I don't know the future, I don't know the next thing, you know, that you're gonna say necessarily. I can make educated guesses, but I don't know everything, so you know, you can ask me a question, I'm still Kugrash."
"Sofia: Yeah, I mean, I-"
Ricky: What are you eating?
"Kugrash: I am eating a different bagel, not the-"
[Brennan laughs]
Sofia: I am glad that you developed a taste for it.
"Emily: Yeah, I think I look at Pete and Kingston and just say,"
Sofia: I think we're just looking for anything that will help us take on this threat to both the dreaming and the waking world.
"Pete: Yeah. What do you know about Null, if anything?"
"Kugrash: I know a lot of what you guys have come to know, that Null is older than any of the other beings, that it was kind of the first, it's nothing. It existed before gods, it existed before anything, and he's a monarch of the Dreaming, and its ultimate goal is to consume everything, basically consolidate all of time down to just a single moment, just, you know, get back to nothingness. Now, the reason Null wasn't able to get to New York in the past was because of the three spirits, who I kind of at the time I didn't, you know, understand the significance of them, I just thought hey, cool, spicy pigeon, juicy cockroach, unicorn, you know, this'll help me help the people of New York out. But they were quite significant, and that helped, you know, take care of the forgotten people around New York and Null wasn't able to get here, and the only reason that the spirits are alive still after I died is 'cause of Ricky, for taking up the mantle. So thanks for that, Rick."
"Ricky: Hey, no problem. It's been fun. It's honestly great. I didn't realize that that would be part of it, and it's been interesting having them connected to me."
"Kugrash: Yeah, I sense that you're not loving the aesthetic, but generally you like the vibes, but not the aesthetic."
Ricky: The vibes are amazing.
"Kugrash: Right, yeah. Yeah, you'll learn to love this shit. At first when I was living in the sewer, I'm like, ah, I'm a fucking rat, this is fucking weird! I used to live in like a cool-ass condo, and now I live in the sewer. But, you know, the sewer's, you know, there's a lot of cool literal shit in there, so."
Ricky: I guess I'm struggling with why I would have to be in the sewer as much as maybe you were.
"Kugrash: Right, no, well that's optional, you don't have to go in the sewer. You might have to go to the sewer. You might have to go to the sewer, you don't have to live in the sewer."
Ricky: Right.
Kugrash: If that makes sense.
"Ricky: Okay, that's huge, that's great, that's cool."
"Kugrash: Yeah, you don't have to be exactly like me, I was a rat man who would freak people out whenever I came out. You are a very handsome man, you beautiful bastard."
"Ricky: Well, I mean, Kugrash, I don't want to jump the gun, but, like, what do I do with this stuff? I mean, it's weird to have, I don't… I would be lying if I said I fully understood it, but I don't know if you had any advice for me on that."
"Kugrash: I mean, you're doing all the right things so far. You kind of awakened the spirits again. They were weakened when I died, but now they're back with Perry and the juicy cockroach, and once you bring them all together, I think you'll be able to do a lot of good. Getting back to what I was talking about before, before Ricky and before I kind of protected the city, there was the Dragon of Bleecker Street, and dragons are the antithesis of something like Null, 'cause dragons collect things. Like, those are memories. Those were all powerful things. That is the opposite of Null. So Null could not get in while the Dragon of Bleecker Street was here."
"Pete: Did the dragon die naturally, or did Null kill the dragon?"
"Kugrash: The dragon… Oh, wow, you kind of stumped me here, Pete, in like a weird way, because the answer is both, if that makes sense? Which is, dragons can die if their hoard is incomplete, and the thing about the Dragon of Bleecker Street is that at sort of the beginning of his life, he only cared about kind of the big, like, glorious, you know, heroic, big, magical things about New York, but wasn't as interested in, you know, the smaller, everyday things, and, you know, because of that, he either forgot about or lost or gave away certain items from his hoard that ended up being pretty important, that Null has since—"
Sofia: Destroyed?
"Kugrash: Erased. Erased, to a certain extent. They're not completely gone, because I still kind of remember that they exist. I know that there's seven things that are missing from the Dragon of Bleecker Street's hoard."
Emily and Ally’s jaws drop. Lou and Ally’s eyes go wide.
Kugrash: One of them—
Sofia: And—
"Pete: Can— Yeah, can you give us those?"
"Sofia: Excuse me, let me get a piece of paper and a pencil. Oh wow, this pencil's so big!"
Ally: We're all working to use a pencil together.
Brennan: Watching your guys' face when Murph gave you guys a hard number light up like fucking Christmas trees was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.
[Emily laughs]
"Ally: I mean, in fantasy, when you hear that there's seven anything, you're like, and that’s what we need!"
"Siobhan: Yeah, baby, we got to collect them."
Zac: At the very least write them down.
"Emily: Anyways, yeah, we're all using one big pencil to write it down."
"Ally: We're all using one big pencil, we're writing on a napkin."
Siobhan: The Chinese takeout chopsticks of destiny.
"Sofia: Okay, Kug, lay it on us."
"Kugrash: Right. So, the only one that I can remember fully is Peter Stuyvesant's wooden leg. That was one of them. I remember that one specifically. The other six are more kind of vague, which means that maybe somebody else remembers them in some kind of vague way or something, I'm not entirely sure what it means. But there's a candle, a coin, a bouquet, a scrap of paper, a baseball, and a cymbal, like a musical cymbal, not just, you know, a symbol of something."
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah, there's symbolism in the cymbal, yeah yeah."
"Kugrash: Exactly, yes. A cymbal that's a symbol, as it were."
"Sofia: Kug, do you think it's-"
Iga: C Y M B A L?
Kugrash: Yes.
"Emily: We're all, again, all spelling this at the same time."
Kingston: How do you spell Stuyvesant? S… T…
Ally: We started to misspell “cymbal” and we just decided fuck it.
Emily: Now we have to like-
"Iga: Turn it around, turn it around, turn it around!"
"Kugrash: Here's the thing, I'm actually not that good at spelling, 'cause I hear, you know, like the bad spellers just as much as I hear the good spellers, so it's just a mess, it's just a mess in here."
"Sofia: I mean, I think spelling and language in general is kind of something that you agree upon as a culture."
Kugrash: That’s true.
"Ricky: Yeah, words are made up, right?"
"Kugrash: That's true. Anyway. So the dragon got sick and eventually passed away because of these missing items, and at the end of his life, when Kingston met him, was having regrets about not valuing kind of the smaller things about life in New York, so that is when the Dragon of Bleecker Street created the spicy pigeon, the juicy cockroach, and the unicorn."
"Sofia: Aw, I mean, the unicorn's obvious, not appreciating the pigeon and the rat, that makes sense."
"Kugrash: Well they, yeah, the unicorn I think is, you know, a representation of the magical things, and then the spicy pigeon and the juicy cockroach are representative of juicy cockroaches and spicy pigeons, of which there are many. So the best way to defeat Null is for you all to hatch a new dragon to recreate the hoard of the Dragon of Bleecker Street and once again protect it from Null."
"Sofia: Kug, I have a question. The fact that some of them are more difficult to remember, do you have any idea if these items have been taken deeper into the Dreaming, or if it's just a general erasing effect? Is it like a proximity thing? Like, are they hard to remember because they've been taken so deep?"
Kugrash: I'm not exactly sure where they are.
Sofia: Okay.
Kugrash: Null has gotten to them in some way for me to have forgotten them. They may fully be destroyed in the present.
Sofia: Okay.
"Kugrash: But there might still be a way to get to them, 'cause the fact that I still remember them means that somebody else does."
"Ricky: Do you know if Peter had another leg? Did he replace it, or… I'm just wondering at what point... Is Peter okay?"
"Kugrash: Is Peter, dude, Peter is—"
Iga: Peter Stuyvesant is from really long ago.
Sofia: Yeah.
"Kugrash: Ricky, I'm so sorry, Peter is dead."
Ricky turns away and lowers his head.
Iga: He is very dead.
Ally: I hug Ricky.
"Iga: He is from New Amsterdam, Ricky! He's not even from New York, he's from New Amsterdam."
Kingston: He lived a good life. He did great things.
Ricky: [nods] Okay. Okay.
"Sofia: If you want, we can look up a Peter Stuyvesant in the phone book and just go check up on them."
"Kugrash: But if you wanted to talk to somebody other than me about all this, the Dragon of Bleecker Street was brought to New York in the late 1800s by the Shen family. They're a family of sorcerers that are still living in Chinatown, so they're still here."
"Iga: Wait, the Manhattan Chinatown or the Queens Chinatown?"
Kugrash: The Manhattan Chinatown.
Kingston: Yeah.
Iga: Okay.
"Lou: Brennan, have I met anyone in the Shen family?"
Brennan: I'm gonna say that Kingston absolutely knows the Shen family.
"Kingston: I know the Shen family, we got an in. Don't even worry about it. Kug, can we, like, will this struggle with Null be forever, or is Null something we can vanquish or, I don't know. Is this going to be just a new forever, or I don't know, how bad can we beat this thing?"
"Kugrash: So there's two parts of this, right? Gladiator is very real. Gladiator is an actual company that exists in the waking world. It is not created by Null, it is an actual company that is buying up property and, you know, destroying a lot of neighborhoods, and Null is simply taking advantage of that. There are people who are possessed by Null, but they're only being possessed because they have holes in them. They're, you know, rich people who are trying to collect money when they couldn't possibly need more, they're people who, you know, are vulnerable, who hate their jobs, who feel soulless, and Null is taking advantage of that. So in the waking world, you have to fight Gladiator tooth and nail in any way you can, and on the dream side of it, you need a fucking dragon."
"Sofia: Okay, wow, that is descriptive."
Ricky: Do you know the AC of their robots?
"Kingston: Thank you, Ricky, thank you. Thank you, Ricky."
"Iga: Do they have resistances to any kind of damage, any vulnerabilities?"
Kugrash: Of course I know the AC of their robots.
"Pete: Kug, I was wondering, do you know who is possessed by Null when it comes to Gladiator?"
"Kugrash: So it's not an… When you talk to sort of weird dudes in suits and they have static coming out of their mouths, that is them being possessed by Null. They are not necessarily all day every day, you know, zombies of Null, they are ruthless business people who, at times, are having kind of their emotions manipulated to, you know, buy up more ad space, to buy more apartment buildings. So on the Gladiator side of things, it's less about going and just like, you know, there's no wizard who is running Gladiator, if that makes sense."
"Ally: Yeah. I have a question, but I don't know if this is an ask Kugrash question, but I'm just wondering, like—"
"Emily: I have a question for Kugrash, too."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: Like, mechanically-wise, like this world that you've set up, is there like any incentive for these people to embrace Null? Is there some sort of like power that they're getting?"
"Brennan: I think Pete can, in the weird void here, make an arcana check, because you have a connection to Null. So as Kugrash is saying like, yeah, go ahead and have Pete give me, and because of your infinite power right now, go ahead and give me an arcana check with advantage."
"Ally: Okay. Ooh, that is a 22."
"Brennan: 22, hell yeah. As Kugrash talks about the nature of Null and Gladiator, Pete made contact with this entity. You touched Null, and you haven't really gotten a sense of Gladiator until you reach out from void here, from this like, Kugrash is sort of the other side of the coin, so to speak."
Murph: Hell yes.
Brennan: Of like a positive void.
Zac: Cody's just nodding at Kugrash.
"Murph: Yeah, Cody's nodding the whole time."
"Brennan: You reach out and realize that Nod was mistaken about the nature of Null and these older siblings out in the deep Dreaming. Nod was like, they stay away from the waking world, and that's true, they don't go to places like the sixth borough that are these kind of coral reefs close to the shore, right? What you realize is that these other beings do have ways of interacting in the waking world. For lack of a better word, Gladiator is the Vox Phantasma of Null, but Null would never choose an individual that could understand it, right? 'Cause that's the thing Null doesn't want. Null doesn't want to be named, doesn't want to be understood, it doesn't want to even be perceived, right?"
Emily: It needs mindless workers.
"Brennan: Mindless. And it gets more powerful the more people are unaware of it, right? So its perfect champion would never be a person, its perfect champion would be a complex series of relationships. It would be an organization, a structure, a system in which every person could seek to bring it about into the waking world without ever being aware of it. And when Kugrash describes these little bits of static, which, by the way, Kingston saw, you had that vision of someone's eyes going static for a moment, you're realizing that Null wouldn't take people over in this like force of wills like a demonic possession, like, ""I'm fighting, but I'm being taken over!"" It would take people over in the moments where they went on autopilot. It would take people over like when you're not thinking while you're driving. It would take people over in the moments where you're not in full awareness of the actions you're taking or what they mean or what they signify. Lack of awareness is, of course, the place that this extra-planar entity operates from. So I think-"
"Ally: So it's not like a possession, it's more like a carbon monoxide leak."
Brennan: [laughs] Yes.
"Ally: Or like you know, like yeah."
"Brennan: That's the thing is, Pete, you would still describe it as a possession, it is working its terrible influence on the world, but it is the equivalent of a carbon monoxide leak rather than a lethal injection. It's happening in ambient, it's happening in negative space. It doesn't need to possess one person for their whole life and create an evil cultist wizard that you guys could just go behead in one fight and now Gladiator is good. Why possess one person when you could ambiently possess people, each of them a couple minutes a day, in moments where they're not paying attention over an entire global corporation? So it's way scarier than a cabal of seven executives that each consciously want to bring about the end of the world. If you guys went and killed the CEO of Gladiator, Null would find the secret spaces in the mind of whoever got appointed CEO next, and it is rather this organization and all of those empty spaces in the relationships between people that are the puppet Null is wielding in the material world. So it is a very real, magical, extra-planar threat, but it is this weird, I think Pete would probably think of, like, weird, techno, like, hive mind shit. You know, like, for lack of a better word, like the scariest thing about like the agents in ""The Matrix"" was that any single person could become them at a moment, and that seems to be the way Null is working, of like, oh, I can just become whoever I need to be in the moment, because I'm spread out, you know, in this haze, a lot like the Umbral Arcana. Like, I'm ambiently everywhere all the time."
"Ally: With that arcana check, would I know if we have all been touched by Null at some point in our lives? Is it something like that? Like, anyone?"
"Brennan: With that 22, I think Pete wouldn't know that for certain, but would definitely have cause to fear that. Because Null looks for the empty places not only inside of cities and corporations, but also inside of people, and I think that Pete might very well be like, you know, maybe not to the scale of having your eyes go static and moving to like buy the Central Park Carousel, you know, but like maybe on the scale of, like, momentary lapses in judgment, bad decisions, moments where you lose your connection to something, yeah. You think probably you have been possessed by Null in fractions of a second throughout many different points in your life."
Ally: Wow. Cool.
"Sofia: Can I, okay, so this sort of, it doesn't hit close to home, it just makes me think of something. Kug, is there some kind of good version of Null? Because, I mean, I say this as someone who, you know, the Order of the Concrete Fist introduced me to, you know, meditation, and a lot of that is going to a place of nothingness so that you can better grapple with the past and the future, and so I'm curious if there's a good form of Null, or if there's an amount of Null that's okay, or what that means. Because a lot of times, the past and the present encroach, I mean the past and the future encroach on the present, you know?"
"Kugrash: Right. I mean, Soph, the opposite of nothing is everything,"
Murph: And I waft a big stinky thing of shit.
"Kingston: God, come on, Kug, damn."
"Kugrash: It's everything! Shit is everything! It's everything boiled down, it's perfect!"
"Sofia: Right, but like if you have too much everything, then your brain starts going crazy, and you can't take a breath, you know? Or if you're living too much in the past or you're living too much in the future, so I guess I'm just trying to understand, like, if it's okay that, you know, when I meditate, there's an emptiness to it. Is that making me vulnerable to Null or is there value to that as well?"
"Kugrash: No, I mean, yeah, you're meditating. Clearing your mind is not the same as forgetting, if that makes sense."
"Sofia: Okay. Yeah, I guess I'm just curious what that is, then."
"Pete: 'Cause I know for me, meditating is like mindfulness, or like getting in touch with what I'm feeling and stuff and it does feel different than when I'm just kind of in a haze and not really caring about the week."
Ricky: Mindful versus mindless.
Pete: Yeah.
"Sofia: I think that there's, like, a lot of different types of meditation though, and some are, like, some of it is tuning into your present and some of it is finding a nothingness. I know that there's just a lot of, there are people who sort of connect with a nothingness, and that can bring them peace. So I don't know, I guess I just was curious if there was a good nothingness."
"Kugrash: Yeah, I mean, the, like, being completely in the present moment and just taking things in is different than mindlessly sitting at your desk and forgetting why you woke up in the morning."
"Sofia: Mm-hm, yeah."
"Brennan: I would say if Sofia wants to make either a religion or an insight check in this moment, go for it."
Emily: Okay.
Ally: Can I give her the help action?
"Brennan: Sure, yeah yeah yeah."
"Emily: Okay. Oh god, I rolled poorly. That is going to be an 11."
"Brennan: I think Sofia is as confused by this as possible, and I think within all of this, like, I think Sofia, in a weird way, is like feeling sympathy for nothingness right now, or it sounds like, of like this concept-"
"Emily: It's definitely not sympathy, it's definitely not sympathy. What Sofia's feeling the most is a curiosity if there's a good version of this. You know, like one that appreciates balance, one that doesn't try to consume the present or the past, but tries to live amongst it."
"Brennan: I think that, yeah, I mean, you're in this place of kind of void right now that is very warm and welcoming. I think that with sort of that roll, I think Sofia probably is living in confusion in this moment around whether there is a good version of this, and also the interesting thing about when you are concentrating on nothingness, when you are clearing your mind, the relationship between the idea of true nothingness, but then also the ability, when you're meditating on nothing, the idea of unity, because the number that is closest to zero is one, and there is a degree of meditation where you are getting rid of everything, because you're realizing that everything isn't nothing, but it is just one thing, and you're erasing those boundaries between you and your connection to everything else. I think that maybe Sofia is sort of like observing, like, what is the difference between everything and nothing? And like, it's a very like monk-like meditation. That's sort of like, I don't think there's a solution to that. I think there's like a koan for, like, Sofia to meditate on of like, oh shit."
"Sofia: Right, okay, I'll stitch it on a pillow and give to the monastery as a peace offering."
"Brennan: [laughs] Incredible. So you guys have written down these seven objects with this giant pencil in negative space looking at this star rat. And yes, Kingston, you do know the Shen family. They're old pals, you've been down there a bunch. They're good people in the Unsleeping City and are specifically a force for, like… The Shen family focuses a lot of their efforts on Chinatown in particular, because Chinatown is one of the oldest and most magically powerful neighborhoods. You have probably like helped each other many times throughout the years."
Lou: Great. Is there a name?
"Brennan: Oh sure, you would know a couple of them. The main people right now that are doing stuff, because some members of the family kind of are, like, taking care of the family business more than others-"
Lou: Which is?
"Brennan: The family business is learning profound magic and protecting Chinatown from threats arcane and extradimensional. You would know Li Ji and Jung Wei, are the two people that you know there. You didn't know that they had a connection to the Dragon of Bleecker Street. So that is what you guys know there. Yeah, so I think Sofia, you have that meditation, and Pete you have that recognition of Gladiator's relationship, that like Null moves in extremely hard to combat ways. They're very ambient, they're not gonna make the mistake of like giving you guys one human champion that you can kill and then Null is, like, fucked. But the difficulty of an entity that has chosen as its physical weapon an organization rather than an individual doesn't mean that it's impossible to fight, it's just a different fight than you guys are used to."
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: So I think you come away with that recognition. What do you guys do within the void with Kugrash?
"Sofia: How do we take down Gladiator, then? I know you can't predict the future, it's fine if you don't know. I understand we should probably go toward, you know."
Kugrash: I think you just have to make sure that aspects of the city aren't forgotten and fight to protect the things that are still here.
"Pete: It seems like the big, like, if Null is very like isolation, erasure, and forgetting."
Brennan: Mm-hm.
"Pete: Then it seems like our way of combating it is just with like the opposite of those things, which seems like connection, history, preservation."
"Sofia: And also like if we're able to inspire that, then it will make people less likely to be possessed."
"Pete: Yeah. This is almost like “area of effect,” like, what is that, like awareness campaigns or, you know, like what is the real life version, yeah?"
"Sofia: Yeah, we need to raise consciousness."
Iga: Get people out on the streets.
"Brennan: Yeah, Pete said that area of effect thing, and you guys understand that to be true."
"Ricky: So we just have to take down— I mean, Pete, do you think that 53\/3N has figured out that hard drive stuff?"
"Pete: Yeah, I can definitely go check in on that. I've got to [laughs nervously] actually, hm."
"Sofia: Maybe we should, before you go, I actually have to do a couple ladies' hair."
"Pete: Yeah, do you think we could work on that calendar before I go see 53\/3N?"
Sofia: Yeah.
"Ricky: Yeah. Pete, do you want to do the photo shoot?"
"Pete: Yeah, I would love to."
Ricky: Do you want to be the photographer? I need a photographer.
"Pete: Yeah, definitely, man. I've got a ring light from an ex-girlfriend, so."
"Iga: This reminds me also, Peter, I need to come to your bookshop and buy like a bunch of books, so you should be there. You get commission, right?"
"Pete: Yes, please."
Iga: Great.
"Pete: Come by. I bet I have to work. Let's see, what's today? Oh, it's the day after Thanksgiving. I have a few shifts coming up."
"Brennan: And I think, Sofie, the last thing is, I think you do recognize the truth of Kug's words, that Kug is, at the moment, sort of like an opposite to Null in a way, at least like sort of as infinite. But I'm gonna say here that you guys begin to fade out of your meditation and back to the Monastery of the Sacred Rat."
"Emily: No, I wanted to do his hair one last time!"
[Brennan and Murph laugh]
Emily: I know I can't do a constellation's hair.
"Pete: One last dance, please!"
Lou: One last hairy baby.
Emily: The stars move.
Kugrash: And now I can send you off.
Murph: I do a little like magical stardust to send you back.
"Ally: I weep, I just straight-up weep."
Emily: I definitely cry.
Murph: Smells like shit.
"Lou: Speaking of weeping. Exactly, it smells awful. Kingston is just trying to brush the stardust off of him."
"Brennan: Awesome, you guys arrive back having spoken to Kugrash. Murph, does Kugrash give any last words on the wind of trash as he vanishes?"
"Kugrash: [fading] Yeah, you know what, be careful out there, guys. It's fucked up. It's all fucked up."
Brennan: [laughs] You guys appear back in the Monastery of the Sacred Rat.
"Kingston: So Cody, that was our friend Kugrash."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Iga: Cody, you were very quiet and respectful that whole time."
"Cody: Yeah, well, umm."
Ricky: You didn't have any questions for him?
"Cody: I'm working on that, but also, yeah, I was just kind of blown away in the moment. He seemed really cool."
"Sofia: Yeah, he was really cool. He's really cool."
Kingston: He is. He is really cool.
"Cody: A lot of cool story there, yeah."
"Sofia: Yeah. Really, like, really, yeah."
"Ricky: Wow, thanks, Cody."
"Cody: Just a rich backstory, and like, you know. Cool guy."
"Kingston: I know Sofie, you've got some lady things you need to take care of, I guess we got this calendar in the mix."
"Sofia: What are you referring to? Oh, oh, yes! I have some hair I'm gonna do, yeah. I'm trying to raise some cash."
Kingston: Yeah.
Sofia: And I've got a couple ill-advised brunettes trying to go blonde.
"Kingston: Well, hey, you know, that's their choice."
Sofia: It's absolutely their choice.
"Kingston: But it feels like we got these three pretty hard things to chase down. I mean, we've got the Shen family, and maybe they seem to be helping us maybe with the dragon angle and some of these like artifacts, we got 53\/3N's hard drive, and then I feel like there was one more but now I can't remember."
Iga: Peter Stuyvesant.
Kingston: Oh yeah.
"Iga: If we are going to talk to the Shen family, I did some light Googling."
Kingston: Uh-huh.
"Iga: And Peter Stuyvesant is buried at Saint Mark's, which is very close to the Chinatown."
Kingston: Look at that.
Pete: Ooh.
Ricky: I'd love to grieve.
Pete: With the power of Google!
Iga: Seems like a place.
"Kingston: We're not gonna dig him up, right? That feels ruthless."
Iga: I think it's like a tomb.
"Kingston: Okay, great."
"Iga: I don't think it's a, I think it's like family tomb, family crypt type situation."
"Pete: One of those family tombs. What? I think I can go, also I think I can go see because this wouldn't really be the amount of time it would've taken me to get the full amount anyway, so I can go visit him. Ha, yeah."
"Kingston: Pete, why are you-"
Pete: I'm a good liar.
Kingston: Why are you giving money to 53\/3N? Why is 53\/3N getting money from you?
"Iga: Why are you saying, ""I am a good liar,"" out loud?"
Ally: I fully dissociate.
Ricky: Null has Pete!
"Pete: It's a long story actually, but it's all taken care of now, and you guys definitely don't have to worry about me."
Iga: This is what my children are saying when they are smashing something.
Pete: I'm gonna be all right.
Sofia: Pete.
Ally: And I just hold Sofia's hand.
"Emily: Yeah, I was gonna say, Sofia and Pete just like sweat into each other's palms."
Pete: I'm fine!
"Sofia: I got you, Pete, okay? I'm gonna dye some hair for you, okay?"
"Pete: Thank you. If someone wants a perm and a bleach, what are you gonna do?"
"Sofia: As long as I can keep anyone in the chair, I will, because it's like the longer you keep them in the chair the more money, so anything they want to try."
Pete: Incredible.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you guys are all here. You guys have all the information you need, so what do you guys do? You're here at the monastery. You guys tell me what you do next."
"Ricky: Kingston, it sounds like you and Iga should talk to the sorcerers."
"Kingston: Yeah, I mean, I know a couple of the Shen family from back in the day, so it'd be no thing to go on down there and say hi."
"Ricky: And I don't know that I need to do that calendar right now. I could knock it out if I had some help, but it also feels like maybe not the time."
"Pete: Yeah. Do you need anything from this monastery, Ricky? Or like, do you need help?"
"Ricky: I might talk to Marty for a second, but, like."
Kingston: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ricky: I think that I've made the connection that we need to make. Feels okay to leave.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Yeah.
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: Yeah, Pete, sorry, Ricky, you feel the connection to the unicorn, to Perry and to Marty. You definitely feel like in a moment of need you could summon all of them if you had to."
Zac: [nods] Cool.
"Lou: So that's just now like waiting, like for when we need it. Great."
"Emily: Yeah. And is this like transitioning into downtime, or-"
"Brennan: I think so. It's up to you guys. You guys just went through a long fight. I will say this, it is Sunday night, the weekend after Thanksgiving. Kingston, you've got a lot on your mind in terms of the stuff that you've been saying you need to do since going to David's house on Thursday."
"Pete: Oh no, it's Cyber Monday tomorrow. Is that a Gladiator surge in power?"
[all groan]
"Sofia: Okay, you know what we need? We need 53\/3N to hack the website. The Gladiator website."
"Kingston: There's also, there's something I can do. It's not something I like to do, but there's something I could do."
"Pete: What's that, Kingston?"
"Kingston: I need to head downtown and make a call. But okay, shit. Shit, shit. Kingston's like, okay, yeah, I don't know, yeah. I've got some, I, okay."
"Sofia: Does this relate to Gladiator, or should we ask 53\/3N to hack the website?"
Kingston: It's not Gladiator. I think we should still ask 53\/3N. This is me more asking a favor from the city in a big way.
Sofia: Okay. Okay.
"Pete: Cool. Okay, cool. I mean, I'm gonna talk to 53\/3N anyway, I can help either Ricky, or-"
"Sofia: Why don't I come with you to 53\/3N? In case he starts, like, in case he asks about the drugs, I can say I bought them, I'm dealing in Staten Island now."
"Iga: Wait, drugs? What the hell? Aren't you, no, hang on, what?"
"Pete: All right, fine, I'll fucking come, okay, look. A lot of part of interactions with drugs-"
"Iga: I gave you $2,000 in cash!"
"Pete: Is an addiction to the lifestyle, okay? What your life looked like at the time, sometimes that includes extra money. I dipped back into dealing briefly, immediately regretted it, flushed thousands of dollars worth of cocaine down a magical toilet who got really high, and I hope she's okay now. She's probably ordering Thai food delivery and watching a bunch of Gordon Ramsay YouTube videos. I'm not gonna say where I got those specifics from. So I'm okay now, I am okay, and Sofia actually, like, really helped me through all of that."
"Sofia: Well, oh yeah, Pete helped me though. You know, it goes both ways."
"Pete: Yeah, you want me to maybe broadcast that for you? [laughs] I’m just kidding."
"Sofia: Okay, you know what? Fine! Fair is fair, I fucking outed you, I'll out myself."
"Pete: No no no, it's okay."
Sofia: I'm fucking pregnant.
Kingston: What?
Ricky: What?
Sofia: I'm pregnant with Dale's fucking baby.
Kingston: What?
Sofia: I was gonna wait to tell you all before I told him.
Iga: I don't know who this Dale is.
"Sofia: But now, in an act of penitence, I will—"
Pete: I’m so sorry!
Ricky: You've been pregnant for four years?
"Kingston: Hold on, hold on, hold on, wait."
Sofia: No.
"Kingston: Wait, what?"
Cody: My god.
"Sofia: He was breaking out of heaven, you know, every couple months. It wasn't exactly something you could set your clock to. We didn't use protection because I didn't really think, you know, I guess I didn't think, oh, does heaven have STDs? I don't know, there's a lot of things that didn't go into this, it was all very spur of the moment."
Cody: You had sex with an angel? That's fucking metal as hell. That's awesome.
"Sofia: Multiple times, yeah. Very adventurous."
Ricky: Did it look like his Led Zeppelin T-shirt?
"Cody: Yeah, did it look like this?"
Pete: It's like someone literally… Full reverse cowgirl with an angel.
"Brennan: Kingston, I think you remember this moment, the favor Alejandro asked of you back at JFK."
"Lou: I think, yeah, that's very present in my mind, but I think also there's this like, we just got out of the infinite, and like, I don't know, there's a lot going on. But I do think Kingston, like, clocks this, and is like,"
"Kingston: Okay, all right."
"Sofia: Anyways, oh, but I did go to Dr. Lugash. You can't hurt this baby, so you don't need to coddle me in battle."
"Iga: I got to say, I love Dr. Lugash. He birthed both of my children. He's Russian, we don't hold it against him. He's a good man. He's really good at a lot of different things in a way that you're like, oh, maybe jack of all trades. No, he's a master of like a bunch of stuff. He's a good doctor."
"Ricky: Oh, by the way, congratulations."
Pete: He gave me a double mastectomy.
Iga: Congratulations.
"Cody: Yeah, congratulations."
"Kingston: Yeah, I guess that's the most important part. This is fantastic."
"Sofia: Thank you, it's really confusing because of many aspects that I won't go into. Maybe it's just enough that we all sit with this information for a while."
Ricky: I think there's some pretty obvious reasons why it would be confusing.
"Iga: No, yeah."
"Ricky: So if you need anything from us, we're here."
"Sofia: Thank you, you know, I just need you all to not tell Dale that I told you before him."
"Ricky: Probably won't come up, probably won't tell him."
"Kingston: Yeah, I imagine."
Sofia: Okay.
"Brennan: Incredible. You guys, I think it's getting later in the day on Sunday, Pete's just had this realization about Cyber Monday. I think Kingston is feeling like a need to beat feet. You guys head off, and you guys can all be in touch with each other. You guys walk away not only with these revelations about Sofia's pregnancy, but with this incredible communion with Kugrash, Pete's revelation into the nature of Null's relationship to Gladiator. You guys are facing this fight where Pete, you feel the, you know, Null wreaking havoc on the sixth borough, but you know that if Null has a relationship to Gladiator like Nod had to you, you can affect the sixth borough by the things you are doing. Like, Kingston is right. You can affect the sixth borough by the things you do in the waking world, which means that you don't need to go there physically to help save Nod. There are things you can do here in the city that are probably best done over downtime, and yes you guys have stuff to do, but also, like, it's late Sunday, 53\/3N's probably busy right now. It's probably late to, like, the Shen family might not want to meet you guys, like, tonight on the drop of a dime. So I'm gonna say that we're gonna move into a period of downtime where you guys are doing the stuff that you need to be doing that occur over days, et cetera. So I'm gonna say, let's go ahead, if you guys would be so kind, and let's roll initiative."
Lou: If I'm doing something that night—
"Brennan: Oh yeah, actually I'll say, for anyone that wants to do something that night, we can go for it. But we'll roll initiative for downtime, remember what you rolled. Kingston, what do you do that night?"
Lou: I am headed to the payphone that I spoke to my friend on the moments before I met the Dragon of Bleecker Street.
"Brennan: Hell yes. Kingston, you go all the way down to Lafayette, way downtown. Actually, not too far from Chinatown, if we're being honest. You go to the payphone that you spoke to your cousin Janice on all those years ago when you got her that job at Cornell. By the way, she's doing"
"great, kids are growing up, she's still in Ithaca, comes to visit all the time."
"Lou: And I take my divine token off my neck, off the string, and I push it into the slot, and I'm gonna try for Divine Intervention."
"Brennan: Ooh, that's so fucking cool!"
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Cool.
Brennan: One of the last working payphones in New York City. The subway token goes into it. You're gonna roll a percentile dice. You are looking for the numbers one through 11 here.
Lou: Yes.
"Siobhan: Oof, god, that's so low."
"Lou: Okay, here we go. That is 64."
"Brennan: Okay, the coin appears back out in the change tray. Looks like the phone's not working."
"Lou: Kingston's a little disappointed, hangs the phone up, and just texts the group,"
Kingston: I hope 53\/3N can come through.
Brennan: Incredible. Does anyone else do anything that night?
"Ally: I guess since Kingston said, ""I hope 53\/3N can come through,"" maybe I just hit up 53\/3N."
"Brennan: Cool, yeah, I'd say give me a luck check. Just roll a D20 and we'll say on a 17 through 20,"
Ally: Two.
Brennan: All right. You don't get a response back from 53\/3N immediately. We're gonna go into downtime. Did anyone roll above a Did anyone roll above a 15?
Ally: Yes.
Zac: A 15.
Ally: 18.
"Brennan: 15 and 18, cool. So we're gonna go into a, I'm gonna say a period of, we're not actually gonna do two week bumps this time, we're gonna go ahead and do one week chunks of downtime, 'cause it's getting close to Christmas. You guys see around the city lights are starting to go up. So Pete, that… Sorry, Pete and Ricky, what did Pete and Ricky roll again? Sorry."
Ally: 18.
"Brennan: 18, and Ricky got 15?"
Zac: 15.
"Brennan: Cool, Pete, so we're gonna go with your downtime first that week. What is Pete taking care of as you begin to go into downtime, learning what you learned from Kugrash about the dragon's hoard and Gladiator?"
"Ally: Yeah. I think the three things that I would love to are obviously I go to work, I would love to go to a meeting with Lugash."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Maybe one or two. And then I need to talk to 53\/3N.
"Brennan: Cool, I'm gonna say that because you are prioritizing the meeting with Lugash, prioritizing your sobriety, your die is going to bump back up to a D10. You're doing better."
"Ally: I've never been at a D10, honey."
Brennan: Oh yeah—
Ally: I’ve never been back up to anything!
"Brennan: Okay, so Pete bumps to a D10, Pete's doing great. So this means that your other downtime activities, how about it? Are going to be rolled with, because you're just trying to get a meeting with 53\/3N, I'm gonna say roll that D20 again, still looking for 17 through 20."
Ally: Okay. 17!
"Brennan: Hell yes, baby, way to go."
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: So Pete, 53\/3N hits you up, like, middle of that week, you've been going to meetings, you're so glad you don't have those fucking drugs on you anymore."
"53\/3N: Hey, that's a wrap on the hard drive, huge haul, hit me up whenever."
"Ally: Yeah, great, I go there as soon as possible."
"Brennan: Huge refrigerated thing, he's got his stuff everywhere. You walk into the refrigerated server room, he looks up and goes,"
"53\/3N: Pete, my man. Where the fuck did you get this? Because this shit is raw as hell."
"Pete: Yeah, dude, we really need to take them down. Like, what does it look like? What have you found?"
"Brennan: He passes it and says,"
"53\/3N: Info's all on here. Give it to who you need to give it to. I laid everything out, so all the info is there for who you want to give it to."
"Ally: Can I ask him,"
"Pete: Was there any sort of like defense that you had to, like, what was up with that crazy filling the screen thing that happened to us that like ruined our monitor?"
"Brennan: He looks and says, he says, he says,"
53\/3N: Just some basic firewall bullshit. I didn't encounter anything as crazy as what you were describing.
"Brennan: Pete, I think you recognize that that happened because someone magic was in the presence of this hard drive. That was more about Kingston and Null reacting to Kingston. You see 53\/3N goes… You rolled a 17, right? What would a 17 plus your arcana be, just out of curiosity?"
Ally: That would be a 26.
"Brennan: 53\/3N goes,"
"53\/3N: I got the corporate structures going up through Excelsior, I got the names of CEOs, VPs, CFOs, COOs."
"Brennan: He's like,"
"53\/3N: I got the shit they're trying to bury, I got bribes from the FDA, I got people they're trying to silence, I have lists of employees that are on unionization watch lists. All their fucking dirt, baby, it's all on here. Good looking out. And by the way, dude, thanks for moving that product so fucking quick, way to go."
"Pete: Oh, wait, what do you mean?"
"Brennan: He's like,"
"53\/3N: Got the cash in the bag, man. You're the best. I missed my plug, dude."
Pete: Tell me more about that.
(Brennan laughs)
"Pete: Tell me more about that actually, man, yeah, for sure."
"Brennan: He looks at you. Pete, make an insight check, make an insight check and a deception check with disadvantage right now."
"Ally: Okay, insight is, one moment please. Ooh baby, we're talking a 13 on insight, and then deception with disadvantage?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: Oh, interesting, well, my deception is pretty good as a former dealer. Oh bitch, okay. That's a nat 20 but we'll ignore it. But it's still a 17."
"Brennan: Cool. I'm gonna roll. On a natural 16, 53\/3N looks at you and goes,"
"53\/3N: Oh, never mind, I don't know what I'm talking about. Feel free to hit me up with that money when you need to, man."
"Pete: No no, you got it. Dude, you got it. I'm just wondering, I'm working with some very interesting people."
Ally: Can I try to do another deception check? I need to make sure that I don't have to pay this money.
Brennan: Roll with disadvantage. You got to beat a 21.
Siobhan: Come on.
Ally: It's a 10.
"Brennan: Looks like the calendar's a go, baby. You see 53\/3N says,"
"53\/3N: I don't know who paid me, but clearly it wasn't you. Take your time, obviously, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of it, I'll let you know what's up."
Ally: I cast Friends on him.
"Brennan: Okay, cool, he's not aware of magic, you cast Friends. What's Pete gonna try to do in this moment?"
"Pete: Dude, come on, level with me, man. We've worked together forever. I've got so many irons in so many fires, I'm just kind of, you know, I haven't had coffee yet today."
"Brennan: You've already tried deception, I will let Pete work persuasion. Try to beat that 21 with persuasion to see if you can talk 53\/3N off of this. You're not gonna roll this with disadvantage."
"Ally: Okay, great."
Brennan: This is a straight roll.
"Ally: We've got good persuasion. Oh baby, that is an 11."
Murph: No! Pete!
"Brennan: Okay, I'm gonna bring up one thing here, which is that it is a new day, and so you do have Tides of Chaos. I just want to remind you about your abilities."
"Ally: Yes, okay, thank you."
Brennan: This is the last fucking out for our boy Pete Conlan.
"Ally: Fucking fucker, this is thousands of dollars. Okay."
Lou: How much do you need?
Ally: That is an 18.
Brennan: 18 is not 21.
"Ally: Oh, I had to beat 21? Fucker!"
Brennan: Terrible.
Ally: All right.
"Brennan: He looks at you and goes,"
"53\/3N: Cool, so you have no ide where that money came from? So that's great. Here's your hard drive."
"Pete: Yeah, weird. Huh."
"53\/3N: So you still have my product, go ahead and move that, and we'll be good to go."
"Pete: Yeah, we're like two thirds of the way through, so."
"53\/3N: Great, good good good."
"Brennan: You walk out of there with the hard drive, Pete. You have… Someone tried to settle your debt."
Ally: What the fuck is going on?
Brennan: Make either an investigation or a perception check for me.
Ally: Okay. Rolling like shit today. Eight.
"Brennan: Perception, you can't think of it off the top of your head. Go ahead and roll investigation."
"Ally: Okay. All right, this needs to turn around. Seven plus one, that's also an eight."
Brennan: Cool.
(Ally laughs)
Brennan: You have no fucking idea who could've covered your money. But you do have the hard drive.
Ally: Great.
Brennan: Hell yes. Ricky.
"Ally: Can I text the group and be like,"
"Pete: So, did anyone pay a lot of money for me? Just wondering."
"Iga: Yes, $2,000. I guess, I gave."
"Brennan: But you, it ended up being $4,500, so you still owe 53\/3N $2,500, Pete."
"Ally: Wait, what? Oh no, that was earlier."
Siobhan: I'm talking about the original one.
"Ally: Yeah, oh fuck, okay, cool."
Emily: What would I respond to that? 'Cause wasn't that my goal? Or was that not from...
Brennan: You guys—
"Ally: I mean, yeah, you could hit me back and be like, “no, but I'm still getting the money for you,” and I would probably be like"
"Pete: Cool, thank you, yeah, that's still the plan."
Emily: Cool.
"Sofia: Yeah, no, but I'm working on it."
Brennan: Cool.
Pete: Thanks again.
"Brennan: Ricky, that's gonna be you. So Pete's got the hard drive. Ricky, what are you doing in this first period of downtime?"
"Zac: I think for this period of downtime, Ricky, still working at Helping Hands and still, I think the main thing he wants to do is like find some time with Cody to see if he can help him figure out his weapon situation."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Hell yeah.
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: I love that. So the main thing you're doing in downtime is giving Cody a help action on what he's doing.
"Zac: Yeah, but I think in person. Like I think I was like hoping to try and talk to the Questing Blade."
Brennan: Yes yes yes.
"Zac: And, you know."
Brennan: You will be with him in person for sure. But you're not doing the calendar during this first week.
"Zac: I mean, we can do, like, some pre-pro meetings for this calendar shoot. I have a feeling, like—"
Ally and Lou smile.
Brennan: Cool cool cool.
"Zac: It's a little beyond Ricky's organizational skills, so maybe he's texting with Pete, seeing whoever's available wants to like work on it."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: I feel like, yeah, Cody could help do the calendar as well, like sort of a, “you help me with the sword, I help you with the calendar,” we're just like back and forth, taking pictures, and—"
Ally: The calendar has the sword in one of the photos.
Murph: Yeah.
Ricky: You know where to get costumes and stuff?
"Cody: Umm, yeah."
"Murph: I break into the mall, and I—"
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Grab a bunch of Halloween costumes.
"Ally: Wait, please, goth Ricky, kind of shirtless, like, thirst trap goth Ricky."
"Lou: Wow, too much to imagine."
Ricky: Do you think this kind of calendar would sell?
"Siobhan: Oh my goodness, the ultimate health goth."
"Cody: I know a lot of people we could sell this to, Ricky."
"Brennan: So we're actually gonna cut over to Pete's spot in Queens where Ricky is over helping Cody out. Cody, you're going into your sword stuff, so you guys are here. You have the Peasant's Sword, then there's Thirsting Blade Dark Excalibur Mega Genesis."
"Zac: Is the peasant sword still attached to it, or no?"
"Brennan: No, it hasn't been attached to it."
"Murph: No, we never put it on."
Brennan: Never put it on.
"Murph: My devil wanted to do that, and Cody is not gonna do that."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: You guys actually hear a knock on the door. Pete, you're like in the kitchen, you've got the hard drive, you're still trying to figure out this fucking money thing which is weird. Cody and Ricky, you guys are working on some, like, sword stuff together. You guys hear a knock at the door."
Pete: I'll get it.
Cody: People usually just open the door and walk in and do whatever they want in this place.
Ricky: Strangers?
Cody: That's fucking weird.
Ricky: Do strangers usually-
"Brennan: You guys see, wearing a hoodie and a backpack, is Nick Lisowski, Iga's 14 year old son. He walks in and is like,"
"Nick: Uh, hey guys, that was super awesome, I just wanted to thank you guys for the ride on the train yesterday, and, um, Cody, I know that you've got Thirsting Blade Dark Excalibur Mega Genesis now, and Ricky, I know you're fighting with the Questing Blade."
Ricky: It's actually a different ax.
"Nick: Oh, sorry, it's just a magic, just an ax? Just like a straight-up ax? Oh."
"Ricky: Just a pretty regular ax, yeah."
Nick: Cool. So I kind of was wondering if...
"Brennan: You see he's a little bit nervous, he's got like sweaty palms, he goes like—"
"Cody: Dude, do you want a sword?"
"Brennan: He looks up and is like,"
"Nick: Yeah, kind of."
Brennan: And you see that he looks over at the Peasant Sword.
Cody: Whoa.
"Ricky: What's going on, Nick? I guess we haven't actually chatted all that much."
"Nick: No. Yeah, like, I don't know, I… My mom's always kind of been training my sister, my younger sister, for this like magic stuff, and she invited me on that train, it was kind of the first time that I ever felt, like, kind of included in that sort of thing, and..."
"Pete: And your dad's non-magic, right?"
Nick: Yeah.
"Pete: Yeah, that's hard."
"Nick: Yeah. I'm just worried about my sister, and I just thought, I'm not magic, but if I had, like, a magic sword, I don't know, if anything ever happened, I'd be able to like maybe take care of stuff."
"Pete: Yeah, is there any particular reason you're, like, nervous for, or just in general that, you know, she's in the magic world now?"
Brennan: You guys go ahead and make an insight check.
Ally: There's the roll. 20.
"Brennan: Yeah, I think you see that Nick is carrying a lot of like you know, it's like weird to be the non-magic sibling when you know magic stuff is going on, but I think that there was always such a weight of tradition behind it, but now that he's seen his mom and his sister kind of challenging and reinventing and exploring those traditions, you see he's nervous 'cause he came to a house of a bunch of like adults that his mom knows that are all magical. He's kind of like doing, he's like wilding out, he's like doing a teenage thing. He like clearly didn't ask permission to come do this, and you see he's nervous to be talking to a bunch of grownups and it's that weird moment when kids are teenagers and they start doing stuff on their own without asking permission, and this is very meaningful to him. And you also realize that like, I don't know, there's probably a lot of sadness in this kid. Like, his family has a magic castle that wasn't supposed to be for him, but he knows that that sword belongs to his family's tradition, and he's like sort of scared of asking for it."
Pete: Yeah. I'm making some popcorn on the stovetop if you want to come in and have lunch.
Nick: Popcorn for lunch?
"Pete: Yeah, I put nutritional yeast on it, though. I put nutritional yeast on it."
"Ricky: Pete? Hey, Pete?"
Pete: Huh?
"Ricky: We're gonna need some more calories, we're gonna need some more protein, we're gonna need some-"
"Pete: No, I do olive oil, I cook a little bit of garlic in olive oil and pour it over nutritional yeast."
Cody: Me and Pete just have popcorn lunch. You don't do-
"Ricky: That's not, that's not, that's a snack."
Cody: It has corn in it.
Ricky: That's barely a snack.
"Cody: Okay, okay."
Pete: I have some really weird hot dogs.
"Ricky: Listen, let's talk to, can I talk to Cody real fast for a sec?"
"Cody: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So..."
"Ricky: What do you think of that, Cody? That story."
"Cody: I mean, I think that it's, you know, it's… I think he showed up at the right time. Like, I don't know shit about swords, so he can learn with me, maybe? Can we let him into the sword club?"
"Ricky: Yeah, why don't we do that? That sounds like a great idea."
Cody: Yeah. Are you cool with… Should we give him the peasant sword?
"Ricky: It seems like it's his sword. I didn't really think that he would want it, but at the same time, it's definitely not mine. I'm not really a sword guy again, so if you're cool with it."
"Cody: But you know, you're like helping me with the Questing Blade, so you know enough not to turn your sword into a giant fork."
Ricky: Yeah.
"Cody: Which, like, again, just super important, it turns out."
"Ricky: There's sort of of a level of, I would say, and this is not in a disrespectful way."
Cody: Right.
Ricky: But just sort of a level of common sense knowledge that I have.
Cody: Sure.
"Ricky: Yeah, but an expertise I do not have."
"Ally: I'm off to the side like,"
"Pete: [eating popcorn lunch] Ooh! Common sense, spicy!"
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: And then I think, yeah, I'll, Cody will go over to Nick with Ricky and I think I'll be like,"
"Cody: Hey dude, yeah, I'm gonna be learning a bunch of stuff about all these weapons and everything, and this is your, like, family sword and stuff, so let's figure it out together, right?"
Murph: And give him the peasant sword.
"Brennan: You give Nick the peasant sword. He smiles, he's like,"
"Nick: Thanks, I super appreciate it. You guys are super cool, and, I don't know. Thanks for taking care of my mom."
"Brennan: And you see Nick smiles, takes the sword, and heads out. And it feels good. I think Cody, for this downtime activity that you are doing, you're gonna get a help action from Ricky, so you can roll with advantage on this. It sounds like the downtime activity is really like a history check here, to like learn about these swords and weapons and stuff. Go ahead and roll a history check with advantage. As in all things, the DC is gonna be 20."
"Murph: Great. Yeah, I think Cody is trying to learn about like actual swords and stuff and specifically why this one doesn't work, and yeah."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: So I'll go ahead and make a history check.
Zac: You get advantage.
Murph: With advantage. Yeah.
Brennan: With advantage.
"Murph: Oh, it's a very good thing I had advantage, 'cause I rolled a nat one on one of them, but I got a 16."
"Brennan: 16, cool. So you-"
Zac: Can I just Bless Cody?
"Brennan: Sure, cast Bless on Cody."
Lou: Let's go 20!
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: Okay, so you're gonna need to hit a four on that D4."
"Siobhan: Come on, come on, come on."
Murph: I did it! [claps] Four!
(all cheering)
Brennan: Incredible!
Ally: Hell yeah!
"Brennan: Ricky and Cody, you guys spend that week doing a bunch of work together on swordcraft and weaponry. Cody, you realize, like, there's a ton of awesome history and lore. Cody, go ahead and take a free proficiency in the history skill. You just dive into studying history, studying actual, there's like, you find out awesome martial arts stuff from all around the world, there's like HEMA, like historical European martial arts, Eastern martial arts. You study a bunch of different unarmed techniques from all around the world, from Indonesia, South America. You study all kinds of like, the history of early firearms and all this stuff. There's a tremendous amount of weapons history here. Towards the end of that week, you guys perform, and Ricky, this is you actually casting that bless. You guys find a local, like, forge, run by like this old biker"
"dude that used to be part of the Hell's Angels, and then like, and is now like in his old age is part of that thing where they like protect kids that are like going through weird like legal trouble. You know, those like bikers, the protect children bikers, who runs a blacksmith forge in Queens. You guys disassemble Thirsting Blade Dark Excalibur Mega Genesis into three separate weapons."
(Siobhan laughs)
"Zac: I feel like,"
"Ricky: Cody. I feel like we've done a lot of good work here, but do you mind if I have just a moment with the Questing Blade? I imagine you have more to talk about with the Questing Blade, but I feel like I should have a conversation, sort of a difficult conversation."
"Cody: Sure, I can talk to Mega Genesis over here."
"Ricky: Okay, you don't have to, okay."
[Murph laughs]
Cody: We will both talk to the swords.
Ricky: You got to take a call too?
"Murph: Yeah. Yeah, Cody takes the other two swords and walks off."
"Brennan: Mega Genesis, as you're holding it, goes,"
"Mega Genesis: What's up, you nasty piece of shit? It's Mega Genesis."
"Cody: Fuck you, dude."
"Mega Genesis: Fuck you. Yeah, you wish."
"Cody: Fuck you, you're not a fucking fork sword anymore. I'm gonna fucking sell you on eBay, dude."
Mega Genesis: What the fuck?
"Brennan: So yeah, you're holding onto Mega Genesis and Dark Excalibur now."
Lou: Goddammit.
"Brennan: And Ricky, you have the Questing Blade."
Ricky: Hey.
"Questing Blade: Well, I see that I am being held by a former champion of the Questing Blade, hello. Hello, Ricky Matsui."
"Ricky: Hey, Questing Blade, it's good to talk to you, it's good to see you again, you look great."
"Questing Blade: I don't have eyes and I can't see, so I assume you look great as well."
"Ricky: Thank you. Hey, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I feel like in the moment it felt right to give you up to Dale, and I still feel that way, but at the time I never really was able to clear the air with you and make sure that that was okay for you, and I can see why your feelings would be hurt by that. So I just, I feel like I owed you that."
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me a, go ahead and give me a charisma roll here, just a flat charisma roll."
Murph: Can I Bless Ricky?
Brennan: Yes. You can roll a D4 on that.
Ally: Bros blessing bros.
Zac: I got a four on the Bless.
Murph: Yes!
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Charisma would be 15.
"Brennan: 15\. You feel the Questing Blade goes,"
"Questing Blade: I sincerely and humbly accept your apology, Ricky."
"Ricky: Thank you. I feel like I just want to be clear that I'm happy that our paths crossed where they did, and I'm happy for you to go on your own journey, whichever way you see fit, and I think we shared something beautiful for a little bit there, but it's okay that you're doing your own thing with me, and I hope you understand that."
"Brennan: The Questing Blade nods, and—"
Lou: It nods?
"Brennan: Oh sorry, no. The Questing Blade processes what you have said, and you can tell that there is something that it is meditating on that it is not saying, and the Questing Blade says,"
"Questing Blade: Ricky, do you know why it is that I chose you?"
"Ricky: Well, you know, it seemed like you were in a building that was on fire, and maybe, maybe I was just in the right place at the right time."
"Brennan: Those words sort of echo, maybe even within, I don't know if Ricky… Ricky does his normal self-effacing thing of being like, right place right time, and kind of that attitude of like, anybody would have done it, and the sword goes,"
"Questing Blade: Hm. Right place, right time. Ricky, I too am grateful for the memories that we shared. I am glad that this moment of mutual honor will be the last note of our parting. Thank you for your words, Ricky Matsui."
"Ricky: I hope you… Yeah, I just, I'm thankful for our time together. I think, you know, at the end of the day, I don't even, I definitely think that someone like, someone else needs the Questing Blade more than me, and, you know, I'm not even sure I need this magical ax. You know, like, it's weird, yeah."
"Brennan: The Questing Blade smiles and says,"
"Questing Blade: I don't think you need me, Ricky. I wonder if you ever did. Thank you."
"Ricky: What do you mean by, oh."
Brennan: And you see the Questing Blade goes silent.
Zac: I take the Questing Blade back to Cody.
Ricky: Are you guys fighting?
"Cody: Yeah, Mega Genesis is an absolute fuck, which is great 'cause Mega Genesis looks rad as hell and I am going to sell Mega Genesis on Etsy to kind of make rent, and also I'm gonna buy like some cool, you know, goth stuff from, you know, try to find some like fucking local businesses and shit to buy from."
"Ricky: Whoa, that's awesome, yeah."
"Zac: I hand him back the Questing Blade, kneel deeply."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. I'm gonna say, Cody, I'm gonna say that with that 20 on your history check, you can pawn Mega Genesis and Dark Excalibur and still have the Questing Blade and absolutely make rent, get some sick clothes back, and I think you find like local leather workers that are like actually part of a Satanic temple near you that do like good handcrafted work. They're like cool people to support. I will say also in this moment, with that 20 history check, in researching people in your area that you can like get these new materials from, so now you have cool clothes again, you have the sick boots again, the swords pay for all of it, you also find out some stuff about the history of the Queens Center Mall on that 20 history check. You are looking at like the Hot Topic, and now you're looking at like all these dealers that actually like make this stuff handmade and like real Satanists and you're getting into like, oh look at all these actual people that like study, not like Satan as like a logo on a chain wallet, but like actual, you're like looking up this cool demonology stuff I can study. You look at the history of the Queens Center Mall. The Queens Center Mall took over a bunch of area that used to be residential, and there was also an awesome amusement park that used to be there even before the mall called Fairyland. It was a like cool, tiny neighborhood amusement park that was a really accessible place that like kids in the neighborhood could go to. It was like, you know, it was cheap to go there, it brought magic and wonder to that neighborhood, and I think Cody reflects on that bit of Queens history as well."
Murph: Cody just drops whatever he's drinking.
Cody: [broken] Ugh. The fucking mall was Gladiator all along. The fucking mall was Gladiator all along.
Ricky: There's Code Red all over the floor.
(all laugh)
Cody: That was there before.
Ally: You know it was Code Red.
"Brennan: So Pete, you don't know where that money came from, you have the hard drive. For our other three characters, did anyone roll on their initiative for downtime higher than a 10?"
Siobhan: I got a 12.
Brennan: What did Kingston get?
Lou: I got a 13.
"Brennan: Kingston, it is Cyber Monday. What do you do as you wake up?"
Lou: I get out of bed and I go right back to that payphone.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me another check, and because we're in downtime, you can make these rolls once a day, so you're gonna give me six more rolls. Here's the one for Cyber Monday."
Lou: Cyber Monday is an 87. The one for Tuesday is a 47. The one for Wednesday is a 78. Thursday is a 22. Friday is a 55. Saturday is a 47.
Siobhan: Goddamn.
"Brennan: Cool. That's our first week. You go put the token into the payphone every day that week, but you also still have your downtime activity. It only takes an action for you to try to do Divine Intervention. Go ahead and what is Kingston doing in his downtime that week?"
"Lou: Is the Shen family a downtime activity, or is that a-"
"Brennan: That's a scene we can just run. So I think you guys round up the troops. I think you guys are on the subway headed towards Chinatown. Awesome. Pete, you have the hard drive there and can absolutely like boot it up on a laptop. Kingston, as you are looking at this, you see all this incredible stuff here. You see… Here's what you find in all of that. The CEO of Gladiator is a man named Russel Blankenship. The VP of operations is a guy named Matthew Cleary. The CEO of Excelsior Dynamic Homes is named Evan Holloway. There is a tremendous amount of dirt on employees they believe are trying to start unions, names of reporters they've filed cease and desist letters for, there are records of FDA bribes on here, which specifically is about the deleterious health effects of Cypher Energy Fluid, proof that they got it passed through. You see there is also, there is also some stuff in here about their training facilities in Connecticut, where Josh Mendoza is going to get trained, specifically it looks like a relationship of stock being given to a local judge and a police department in Connecticut because of a warehouse worker that died from what they said were natural causes, but died in his parked car on the way home from work. And as you look at it, it looks like a worker, you parse through and can see some of the stuff here that 53\/3N underlines, which is, there is weird financial relationships between the police and the judge here, and a timecard that that this worker had worked for 40 hours straight and died, and that the theory might be that the body was picked up off the warehouse floor and moved to his own parked car."
Ally: Oof. Dark.
"Cody: Uh, Pete, have you seen, like, Josh around the house?"
Pete: No.
"Ally: I don't think so, right? Have we seen Josh?"
"Brennan: This guy was not Josh, but you also have not seen Josh in a long time."
"Murph: Yeah, I know this isn't Josh,"
Pete: Do you think we should text Josh?
"Murph: I'm just like, I want to make sure he's not working 300 hours a week or whatever, yeah, I'm going to, physically impossible, but some amount of hours. Yes, I will text Josh and be like,"
"Cody: Um, hey, dude. Fuck, how is, uh—"
"Ally: It says ""uh."""
"Cody: How is working for the enemy, LOL?"
Brennan: You get no response back from Josh to that text.
"Ally: Okay, I text Josh, and it's like—"
"Cody: Guys, this is crazy, I totally reached out. The olive branch!"
"Ally: I text Josh and it's like,"
"Pete: Hey man, I bet you've been working crazy hours, but I'm gonna maybe make a roommate dinner this week if you're interested."
Brennan: No response back.
"Pete: All right, so it wasn't the tone."
Ricky: Should I text him? I don't have his number.
"Cody: Yeah, Ricky—"
"Ricky: “Hey, Josh, Ricky here—”"
"Cody: If you want to text him from my phone, 'cause whatever, my approach is weird."
"Zac: So I'm assuming Cody apologizes for what he said, just—"
Cody: I said LOL.
"Ricky: Oh, right."
"Brennan: You guys text Josh. No response from Josh. You guys are heading down on the train. The last thing you find, Kingston, in that hard drive, is a list of campaign contributions to a lot of city council people in New York and relationships between New York's civic infrastructure and business relationships with Gladiator. Now, this hard drive is stolen and super illegal, but what it gives Kingston is names, names, names, names, names."
Iga: Can we link this to the journalists? Do you have a relationship with some kind of—
Kingston: Yeah.
Lou: Can I call a friend at the Times?
"Brennan: Sure, absolutely."
"Lou: Great, I call my friend at the Times."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. I'm gonna say too, you call your friend at the Times. You have friends at every single newspaper in the city. You can put everybody on this, just like, anonymous tip. Because the thing is, you can't use this hard drive in a court of law, but you can put people onto everything here for them to go hunt it down."
"Ally: Yeah, maybe we do like a full court press. I'm gonna hit up my friends from the bookstore who do a lot of like local politics work and give them all the names of these, like, bought city council members and comptrollers, I mean all of them, just."
"Brennan: Yeah, I think this is maybe Pete, 'cause Pete, have you done your downtime activity yet or no? What was yours?"
Emily: Yeah we started with Pete's.
"Zac: Yeah, it was the first one."
Brennan: Yes.
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: So Kingston, this might be your downtime activity, is like this sort of full court press here."
"Lou: I think so, yeah."
"Brennan: But you head down to the Shens right now. You guys arrive down on Mott Street in Chinatown. You head past Columbus Park, where you see a group of older women practicing Tai Chi in the early morning sunlight, tons of people moving through the streets talking happily. You see shops on the corner, you pass by Canal Street, you see that there are tons of groups of teens out in these big median strip parks, people on park benches drinking giant bubble teas having a great time. You see the smell of incredible food coming out from this massive restaurant, and across the street you see a little tiny narrow staircase going up to an ancient like diamond patterned glass door that has a couple of Chinese characters up on the front of it. Kingston, you know that this is the Shen family building. Much like the Browns up in Harlem, this family has owned their own building for a while."
Lou: I lead the way.
"Brennan: You walk up, and as you approach, you knock on the door. The door opens, and you see that there is a… Hold on one second. There is a beautiful older woman, her hair tied back in a bun. She's got a ton of like fun jewelry, dressed very sharp, like, white, sort of fashion forward button up shirt, black pants, high heels. She looks and you and goes,"
"Liu Yang: Oh my goodness, Kingston Brown? A visit from the voice of the city?"
"Brennan: Mwah, mwah, gives you a kiss on each cheek."
"Kingston: It's been too long, it's been much too long. I'm sorry I couldn't get down here sooner."
"Brennan: She smiles. She's sort of got graying hair tied up in a bun. She looks and says,"
"Liu Yang: Oh, you have some friends here. Your friends all..."
"Kingston: Yes, very much so."
"Liu Yang: Wonderful, then step right this way."
"Brennan: She closes the door, slides the doorknob through the wood like liquid to the other side, opens it back up, and you guys see a beautiful stone bridge extending through mountaintops covered in clouds. Right this way. And she begins to walk down, and goes like,"
"Liu Yang: Can I get you guys some coffee, tea? I think we have some, like, green tea in bottles, we have some water, we have mineral water, whatever it is you guys would like."
Kingston: You know I love a green tea. I'm never gonna say no to a green tea.
"Brennan: A little cloud floats over and she pulls some, like, vapor covered, refrigerated like sort of zero sugar green tea bottles out of this thing, hands them out to people, opens one for herself, takes a sip. She goes,"
Liu Yang: Danny? Do you want to come out and say hi?
"Brennan: As you guys walk out, the bridge extends to this first sort of mountain. There's a large fountain in it filled with coins. She steps through the fountain and motions for you guys to follow, and you are in a palatial room that has a massive plasma screen, and you see there's this young teenage sorcerer kid who looks up, he's got like scenester kind of BluBlockers, a T-shirt, huge chunky sneakers. There is a wall of like extremely fine sneakers on the wall behind him, going in all directions, like ultimate sneakerhead kid playing video games and just sort of like floating in the air on this puff of cloud. You see he looks up, goes,"
"Danny: Hey what's up, I'm Danny. Nice to meet you guys."
"Brennan: You see that Liu Yang looks over and says,"
"Liu Yang: Danny, stand up, come here."
"Brennan: He floats, and you get the impression that this kid hasn't touched the ground in years, specifically to keep his sneakers in mint condition."
(Siobhan and Ally laugh)
Brennan: He comes over and says-
"Pete: Yes, dog, dude."
"Brennan: He looks and you and says,"
"Danny: Oh, word."
"Brennan: He's like,"
"Danny: Dude, are you Pete Conlan? You're the Vox Phantasma, right?"
"Pete: Yeah, hey."
"Danny: Hey, I was talking to Ana and Amelia Ortiz. Are you like, here on business right now, or are you like, what's kind of the, what's up?"
"Pete: Yeah, I mean, if you're talking like, you know, I don't do that anymore, actually."
"Danny: Shit, shit. Cool cool cool. Yeah yeah yeah, for sure."
"Pete: I'm not, you know, that was just a me choice. I don't judge."
"Ally: I just get really awkward, I'm not used to being this fucking person in an interaction."
Brennan: Yes.
"Pete: I mean, I don't judge. One day at a time, it works if you work it and you're worth it."
"Brennan: You see Danny is like,"
"Danny: Cool cool, no worries, no worries. Welcome to the House of Shen."
"Brennan: You guys see teleporting in are two very kind looking older men. One of them has a bald head and appears to be the sort of like, the patriarch of the family here, and you see that there is an extremely brawny man standing next to him who also looks older, and you see just clearly doesn't have like a family resemblance to the others here, and appears to be this older patriarch's partner. Sofia, you immediately clock from the partner that is, is a like very powerful monk. You can like feel the ki radiating off him. Jung Wei, who is the old patriarch of the family, looks and says,"
"Jung Wei: Well, as I live and breathe, Kingston Brown from uptown. (laughs)"
"Kingston: Jung, it's so good to see you. I'm sorry, I was just apologizing earlier. You know, I should be coming down here more often. I mean, this green tea is incredible, and no calories. Not a one."
"Jung Wei: Nope, no calories in that. They only sell it in shops down here around the corner. We get it, it's not like you can just buy that at any old place, it's great. You know, why do you need so much sugar in everything? You go to buy a regular tea, it's like, no, I just want to be evened out, a little boost of energy, of clean natural energy."
"Kingston: Thank you, thank you."
"Jung Wei: It's great, it's excellent."
Pete: I love tea.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
Jung Wei: I can tell from your ornate teapot there.
"Pete: I freaking love tea. Do you think I could get some of this, just to have in my little tea box?"
"Jung Wei: Sure, yes, of course."
"Brennan: You see that Jung Wei looks over to a wall that has this incredible, sick, like, clearly Danny has painted this. It's like a spray paint graffiti dragon covering the wall. Iga, you sense from the Shen family that they are draconic bloodline sorcerers like you. So you see Danny hits this wall. The wall parts, and you see this ancient, spiraling helix of shelves and drawers opening up, kind of spinning into infinity. One of them opens and a small baggie of tea with a beautiful little gilded character on it, and you see there's a small price tag that Jung Wei just rips off and tosses and says,"
"Jung Wei: For the Vox Phantasma, on the house, please."
"Pete: I appreciate it so much, this is so special."
Ally: I put it in my little box.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Jung Wei: Yes, very very special."
Brennan: And looks back at the infinite series of drawers spinning off.
"Jung Wei: This is very special, of course."
"Pete: Rare, rare, cool, beautiful tea."
"Jung Wei: Yes, extremely rare, it's..."
"Brennan: You see that he looks over at Kingston and says,"
"Jung Wei: To what do we owe the honor of this… Oh, by the way, my partner Li Ji."
"Brennan: And you see that the monk sort of nods and says,"
Li Ji: Welcome down to Chinatown. It's rare to see so many of the champions of New York City gathered. I hope everything's all right.
Brennan: And raises an eyebrow.
"Kingston: Oh, we're here on big business. There's a lot to take care of."
"Sofia: Oh, good movie."
Pete: What are we here on?
Sofia: Big business.
Kingston: Big business?
"Sofia: Good movie, I love that movie."
"Pete: Oh, cool."
"Brennan: You see Danny looks up and says,"
"Danny: Starring Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin, hell yeah, great film."
"Kingston: Oh, you know,"
Pete: 1988.
Kingston: I wasn't even talking about that movie. A classic.
Sofia: I was a kid. I was a really young kid.
Pete: I wasn't born yet.
"Kingston: I saw that in theaters five times. Five times. Lily Tomlin is a gift! Anyway. I just wanted, we're here for a number of reasons, one of which being this,"
"Lou: And I don't know where we have the egg, but I think I produce it."
"Danny: You've got it, man."
"Lou: Yeah, I produce the egg. How big is the egg?"
Brennan: [holds his hands about a yard apart] About that big.
"Lou: Okay yeah, that's what I thought, yeah."
Siobhan: You've just been carrying it around.
"Lou: Yeah, I just-"
Brennan: Take it out of an enormous fucking messenger bag.
Lou: Yeah. [laughs]
"Brennan: Kingston, you see the entire Shen family looks around. There's a moment where Li Ji is like looking around at everyone else who immediately clocks it. This other monk is like,"
"Li Ji: What, what's going on?"
"Brennan: And you see that Jung Wei looks and goes,"
Jung Wei: Where on Earth did you get this?
Kingston: May I introduce Iga Lisowski?
"Iga: Hi, hello, it's nice to… This is really beautiful, what you've done with this place. I like it, it's like a mix of old and new, it's good."
"Jung Wei: Well, some, yes. We try to keep as much old around as possible, don't we, Danny?"
"Brennan: And you see Danny just goes like,"
"Danny: What's up?"""
"Brennan: And says,"
"Jung Wei: Yes, the traditions of the past. Remember, dragons specifically rooted in the magic of the past, and if you fuck with it too much, it fucks things up, doesn't it?"
"Brennan: And you see he looks and says,"
"Jung Wei: Sorry, my grandson is-"
"Iga: No, no, my children."
"Jung Wei: Yes, you understand."
"Iga: I get it. They're growing up here, it's different here."
Jung Wei: 100%.
"Brennan: You see that Jung Wei goes,"
"Jung Wei: Well, the Shen family has been blessed for a long time. I take it you're here because of the Dragon of Bleecker Street, yes?"
"Kingston: Yeah, I mean, of course, I have my own relationship with the dragon, but I don't know what role this egg has to play in the future, and, you know, if there's a possible new Dragon of Bleecker Street."
"Brennan: Jung Wei sort of manifests this scroll that he opens and turns it to you, Kingston, and it shows this awesome drawing of the Shen family coming for the first time to New York in the 1870s, settling in Chinatown, and bringing an egg with them. You see that Jung Wei looks up and says,"
"Jung Wei: Our family keeps in touch with the branches of the family that still remain in China, and truthfully the Shen family keeps in touch with our cousins honestly anywhere that there is a Chinatown. We have cousins is San Francisco, we have cousins in Philadelphia, we have cousins all over the world. Our dragon is still very much alive and well in China, where the mother of the Dragon of Bleecker Street, the original Dragon of Bleecker Street, resided. We brought this egg with us to New York in the 1870s along with a number of treasures, relics, different things to help us defend and protect our family and our people, and we ended up… There was a period in the 1870s, towards the end of the 1870s, where something was attacking the city. We lost a tremendous number of scrolls. They just went blank, and the egg began to resemble this."
"Brennan: You see that Jung Wei rolls the scroll down and shows you a portrait of this like dragon's egg that is covered in like beautiful, like, red and gold characters, but also like wood etchings and newspaper, it looks like, and it looks like a fucking 1870s version of the egg you're holding now. You see Jung Wei looks and says,"
"Jung Wei: The egg hatched here in New York and from the moment it was born, my great grandfather reared the young dragon hatchling with the knowledge that it was a great and mythical creature with the knowledge that it would be a protector of this new city and of our family. And it found its cavern, it started its hoard, and thus was born the Dragon of Bleecker Street. We are well aware that the dragon passed away in 1994, but it seems a new egg has in fact been discovered. This is very portentous."
"Brennan: Kingston, give me an insight check."
Lou: I would love to.
"Brennan: And actually, anyone can give me an insight check."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'll do that."
Lou: I'm 23.
Emily: Two.
Brennan: Two?
"Siobhan: Mmm, 12."
"Brennan: Cool. Kingston, with an insight of 23, I think Kingston thinks about how good and glorious and larger than life the Dragon of Bleecker Street was, and there's something about the way Jung Wei is talking about, like, that the dragon was raised, and connects that to the way that the dragon was raised, right? That like Jung Wei's grandfather… That it wasn't raised by another dragon, it was raised by humans, but it was raised by humans who were imparting on it the importance of its mythic station. So you see Jung Wei goes,"
Jung Wei: That is quite a treasure you hold in your hand.
"Brennan: Jung Wei looks at you, Iga, and says,"
"Jung Wei: We would be happy to help you with the specifics of what it is that dragons need or how they work, or-"
"Iga: Oh my goodness, yes, I would love that. Thank you."
"Brennan: The Shen family just rolls it on out. Danny like runs upstairs into an extra-dimensional space, comes back with like a whole bunch of awesome, like, bags of medicine, teas to brew, incredible, like, powerful ancient like nuts and berries and bundles of twigs and all this crazy stuff. Scrolls and scrolls. It's basically like Doctor Spock, like, ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" but for dragons, hands it off to you. But I think you both notice that there's not a lot of, like, parenting guides in here. Jung Wei says,"
"Jung Wei: There was a period of time, a long period of time, where the dragon was a child, was not safe to travel out on its own, was, you know, not too dissimilar. It was, I think, 15 or so years before the dragon was powerful enough to fend for itself."
"Kingston: So you're saying somebody's just gonna need to, like, take care of and raise this dragon like one of his own, just to make sure that it can be something for the city of New York long off into the future?"
Pete: Sounds like a job for me.
"Lou: Kingston's heart, like, stops for a second when Pete says this."
"Kingston: Oh, we're joking, we're joking, yeah."
Pete: I'm just kidding.
Kingston: “Could be Pete.”
"Pete: Dude, that sounds like you, man."
"Kingston: Yeah, yeah. You know, but I'm also, I'm old, and Liz is… I mean, we already got a dog in the house, you know, I don't know how she's gonna feel about a dragon in the house."
"Brennan: You see that Liu Yang goes like,"
"Liu Yang: Yeah, you do already have a dog, so that's probably gonna be hard, yeah, for sure."
"Sofia: I bet dogs are more work than dragons, though. Dogs seem like a lot of work."
"Kingston: Oh, Bruce is a ton of work."
"Sofia: Yeah, so if you're already used to it, you might… It might not feel like, they always say, like, oh, you know, if you have two cats versus one cat, it's kind of the same thing."
Ricky: Yeah.
Kingston: Two cats versus one cat.
"Iga: Yeah, one dog and one dragon versus just one dog. It's the same. It's either that or Sofia has an angel baby and a dragon baby at the same time."
"Kingston: We're not gonna put that on nobody. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Ally: I think I like slap, like, Kingston's back, and I'm like,"
"Pete: You know that this is perfect for you. Like, come on, man."
"Kingston: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know. It's just, it almost seems, like, too perfect, you know? It's like one of those situations where it's just like, how did this fall into my lap?"
"Pete: Because you deserve it, man."
Sofia: Because you deserve it. Let something too perfect happen to you.
Pete: Yeah.
Siobhan: I Minor Illusion a cigar.
Brennan: You see—
"Ally: On the egg, like the egg is smoking."
"Brennan: You guys load Kingston up with all this like gear from the Shen family. Jung Wei says,"
"Jung Wei: And we will of course be here to aid you with any magical concerns of the like, but-"
"Iga: Perhaps you'd like to come to Greenpoint, meet my family, like we could have a big family… Is that asking too much of you? Just, like, dragon family to dragon family?"
"Kingston: Iga's got her own interdimensional space, much like yours, where you all can go disappear."
"Iga: Your place is very beautiful, I think you will like mine as well. Mine does, to be fair, have a dragon in it."
"Brennan: You see Jung Wei looks over at you and goes like,"
"Jung Wei: Oh, you've got to have an extra-dimensional space. I mean, in New York?"
Iga: New York is so small!
"Jung Wei: It's so small! The square footage! It's about the square footage! Absolutely, yes, of course!"
"Sofia: I could use one, I live in a studio with my mother."
"Brennan: You see Danny just goes,"
Danny: Woof.
"Brennan: You see Jung Wei goes,"
"Jung Wei: Don't be an asshole, Danny!"
"Brennan: You see Danny takes a huge flat brim and puts it on his head and is like,"
"Danny: All right, I'm gonna go out, later."
"Brennan: And just teleports out of here in a flash of runes. You see that Jung Wei looks and says,"
"Jung Wei: I'm so glad we could be of help. The last piece of advice I will give is, it will take a tremendous, without a dragon present, it's very unlikely that the egg will hatch. The original egg only hatched because it was in the presence of a completed hoard, which the dragon eventually moved into its cavern in Bleecker Street. Without a completed hoard, the dragon will not be able to survive hatching. Moreover, without a mother present that can provide the magical heat necessary for incubation, it will need some connection to, as strange as it is to say, a source of its own magic in order to be able to hatch. This is easier when there's other draconic magic flying around, but you would need access to some other powerful spells of the original Dragon of Bleecker Street in order for this new dragon to hatch."
"Lou: So, hold on. Does that mean I need to go find… So you're saying I should… Sorry. I, Lou, I'm confused. So it's like, we need that same kind of… Is the magic of the mother or that connection just draconic in nature or specifically to, like, the Dragon of Bleecker Street draconic? Like, New York draconic?"
"Brennan: I think Jung Wei clarifies and says,"
"Jung Wei: The egg as I'm examining it right now would need to have its hatching process begin by exposure to a powerful magic of the previous dragon that called this place home in order to, in the same way of a coronation, to assume the title."
Sofia: [gasps] I know! Wait a second! This is what we call Kugrash's familiars in for.
Cody: The spicy pigeon and the cockroach.
Sofia: This is—
Kingston: That's it.
Sofia: Yeah.
Ricky: To bring back—
Kingston: To bring back… To hatch this dragon.
"Sofia: To hatch the egg. We need to get the… We didn't know what we needed them for, because we can only like call them together once. We get the hoard."
"Kingston: But we need to complete the hoard, and the hoard is Pete Stuyvesant's leg!"
Iga: And those other six things we don't know.
Sofia: And the other six too.
Kingston: And the other stuff!
"Sofia: And one of them is a scrap of paper, which is absolutely gonna be hard."
"Pete: Absolutely bonkers, yeah."
Iga: Finding a scrap of paper in New York City? How difficult can it be?
"Ricky: We can look at the coins in the river like, maybe one of these."
Emily: I'm going through my purse and I have so many scraps of paper in there.
"Ally: I lean into Kingston and I'm like,"
"Pete: It's your coin, right?"
"Kingston: That was my guess off the top, but it's like right here, I was like, Kug is looking at me. Yeah, yeah, let him go ahead."
"Brennan: Cool. So yeah, Sofia, you realize that that, yeah, that that hatching makes perfect sense. So the hatching is actually not a trial. That's something you guys have already figured out how to do. You have the three spirits. Kugrash could be summoned to do specifically that. However, the scary thing Jung Wei said was that thing about the dragon not being able to survive hatching without access to a completed hoard. So that remains the big question mark."
Ally: All right.
Iga: We need to get these seven mysterious artifacts.
"Brennan: You see that Liu Yang looks at you and goes,"
Liu Yang: Seven mysterious artifacts?
"Brennan: And you see she looks over at Li Ji and goes,"
Liu Yang: Fun. That's fun.
"Brennan: And Li Ji the monk just crosses his huge arms and is like,"
"Li Ji: God, so fun. You guys are gonna have such a great time."
"Ricky: It's a grouping idea, right? It's a grouping idea."
"Li Ji: It's great when there's… I feel like you want three things missing, you want seven things missing, or you want nine things missing."
Sofia: Yeah. Those are the magic numbers.
"Iga: Maybe 13, I would say 13."
"Sofia: I like 13, too."
Iga: At a stretch.
Pete: 12.
"Kingston: Just imagine though, for a second, four things missing. [laughs] I mean, come on, what is that?"
"Iga: That's crazy, what kind of a person loses four things?"
"Sofia: Disgusting, just too neat. Symmetry, ugh."
"Brennan: Jung Wei goes like,"
"Jung Wei: Listen, eight is clearly the lucky, fun number."
"Brennan: And Danny teleports back and is like,"
Danny: Boo to eight.
"Brennan: You see Jung Wei says,"
"Jung Wei: I'm a traditionalist, I think, I feel like eight is the luckiest number, but that's just me."
"Brennan: You see that the Shen family gives you all this fucking dope-ass gear. Jung Wei gives you a big hug, Kingston, and says,"
"Jung Wei: I'm so glad that you were able to help. Best of luck. You know that if you need us, you need only call on us. We'll be ready if he city is in danger."
"Kingston: Thank you, and again, it's so nice to come down and visit you guys. I'm gonna come by more often, if only to get more tea. If only to get more tea."
"Jung Wei: Oh please, of course, we'll get some extra. Send a cloud, send a whole cloud with him."
Brennan: A little cloud full of green teas comes out behind you.
"Jung Wei: Take, just take the cloud, you'll get it back to us when you get it back to us."
"Kingston: Okay, hey, if you insist, I will take the cloud of green tea."
Brennan: The Shen family happily waves from the door. You guys head out. Hell yes.
Ricky: It's a cool place.
Kingston: Right?
Brennan: Yeah.
Ricky: It's a cool place.
Cody: Cool as hell.
"Brennan: Huge revelations abound. Last downtime activities, or I think Kingston, that's just a free scene. What is Kingston's downtime activity that week?"
Lou: I'm gonna call Willy and ask to hang out.
Brennan: You don't get an immediate response from Willy.
"Siobhan: Oh, shit."
"Lou: That's so scary. I text a couple of other friends in Brooklyn. Just, like, fantastical friends in Brooklyn, to see if anyone gets back. Like Buddy, I text Buddy and, you know."
"Siobhan: The on off, the green light red light."
Brennan: Green light red light.
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Buddy gets back to you and is like,"
"Buddy: Hey, Kingston, yeah. I've been texting about this Thursday, I was gonna ask if I could bring a friend to the poker game, and I haven't heard back from Willy in a couple days. I was thinking about heading over to his spot to try to check up on him."
"Kingston: Yeah, yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I might hoof it over there right now. Who are you gonna bring to poker?"
"Buddy: You know, it's funny, I'm seeing somebody these days."
Kingston: What?
"Buddy: Yeah, you know. I know it's like you don't bring your SOs to the poker game, but, I don't know."
"Kingston: Who is it, if I may pry? I don't want to pry if it's a secret, but..."
"Buddy: Her name's Urina, she's a piss elemental, and it's just, I don't know, it's been really special."
Siobhan and Zac are visibly trying not to laugh.
"Kingston: Okay. Okay, sure, sure. Buddy, I'm so happy for you. I'll let you know if I hear anything from Willy."
"Buddy: Yeah, you know, I appreciate it, man. Things are really looking up. It's gonna be a good holidays."
"Kingston: Yeah. Yeah, it is, it is."
Buddy: All right.
Kingston: Take care.
Buddy: You too.
"Lou: Yeah, I'm going to Brooklyn to see if I can track down any sign of Willy."
"Brennan: You head over to Brooklyn ASAP. You knock on the door of Willy's apartment. The door is open. You walk inside and immediately sort of look back. Reaching for the door is a solid brick statue of Willy, completely disanimated."
Siobhan: No!
"Lou: Like, disanimated completely?"
Brennan: You're looking at a piece of art. You're looking at a brick statue. His face looks scared.
Siobhan: [softly] No!
"Lou: Ooh, ooh ooh. Can I make a perception check or an investigation check as to, like, the apartment or the entryway to see if I can glean anything?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can go for both. Give me a perception and investigation."
Lou: Perception is gonna be 25. Investigation is gonna be 19.
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Willy is... On a 25 Perception, Willy is scared and you see his mouth is open because he's in the middle of speaking as he's been frozen."
Lou: Mm-hm.
"Brennan: There are letters in Hebrew on the roof of his mouth. You see two letters. You see two letters in the roof of his mouth. It's weird because they're off center. They're not centered. There's one letter on the top of the roof of his mouth, and then one other to the right of it."
Siobhan: He should have three.
Lou: Do I know he should have three?
Brennan: Give me a religion check.
Lou: Hey. That's a mod 20.
"Brennan: Ooh, that's so good! You've done medicine checks on him before and asked him to open his mouth so that you could put, like, the tongue depressor in there. You've seen three in there before. You don't know what the first of the letters is. You remember what it looked like, but I don't think Kingston… Or does Kingston speak every language? I forget, no."
Lou: I'm a polygot.
"Brennan: Polyglot, you do speak… So you do know that he's missing a letter. You read the two letters in his mouth. Hold on one second. The letters are Mem and Tav, which spells the Hebrew word Met, which means death. You don't know what the first one is supposed to be, but you do know who does. You have a friend out in Crown Heights who is a rabbi and an old friend of yours who you think might be able to help you with this."
"Lou: Yeah, can I take a bunch of like blurry photos and just, you know, just desperately try to get a good angle with my like cell phone camera inside?"
"Ally: Your big case that opens like a book, and you're like."
Zac: Drop some credit cards in his mouth.
"Lou: Yeah, a bunch of my thumb in the photo. Of course Kingston is dead"
"serious in this moment, but yeah, there's just ton of like photos,"
"Kingston: Ah damn, I got too much thumb in there, all right."
"Lou: Take a bunch of photos and I guess I like put a hand on Willy's shoulder and I'm just like,"
Kingston: We gon’ get these bastards.
Lou: And then I head out to Brooklyn.
"Brennan: Hell yes. You get these photos. Kingston, you pop up in Crown Heights where an old good friend, this guy was a good friend of yours back in the 90s when you were first starting out, was extremely helpful with Mummy of the Met stuff back in the day. This is Rabbi Mike Salters. You see, young, handsome Black rabbi from Crown Heights. You see he comes out into the street, gives you a big hug, and goes,"
"Mike: Kingston Brown from way uptown. How's it going, man? You're looking good."
"Kingston: Rabbi Mike, good to see you, man. Hey, what's up? I'm sorry to jump right into business, but Willy's in trouble, man. I saw these photos,"
"Lou: And I show them to him, and I'm like,"
"Kingston: Yeah, I don't know. I know I've looked in this mouth before doing medical stuff and there's a letter missing and I know that these two letters together spell death, and yeah, man, I'm just out of sorts, so what's going on?"
"Brennan: He looks at you and says,"
"Mike: Okay, hold on, let me go get my..."
"Brennan: He rushes back in, he comes out with what looks like a special set of like chisels and hammers around his belt. He's like,"
"Mike: Let's not waste any time, man, let's hit it."
"Brennan: And heads back with you to Willy's spot. On the train he's just talking to you going like,"
"Mike: Okay, so basically, you take three letters, Alef Mem Tav. That spells the word Emet, which means truth. On the roof of a golem's mouth, that should give you what you're looking for. That gives you the animation you're, you know… You spell Alef Mem Tav, Emet, truth, God animates the golem."
"Brennan: And you see that you walk into Willy's apartment, he goes in and just starts chiseling that first letter that will turn the word death into the word truth, and as he does so, you see he reaches into a divine place, offers a rabbi's blessing on Willy, speaks in Hebrew and ends it with,"
"Mike: Willy, we need you back, my man."
Brennan: Willy...
Willy: (gasps) Kingston Brown from uptown! Rabbi Mike!
"Brennan: And gives you guys a big hug and twirls you around in the air as both of you are like, ugh! And get squeezed."
"Kingston: Oh damn, Willy, all right, all right, all right, put us down. Hey, what's going on, man? You know we found you frozen."
"Willy: I didn't know. I went out. I was seeing the neighborhood, and I… I walked by a group of people that… Of course they cannot see me, but truly they could not see me. I was hiding in the brick wall, but the roof of my mouth, they read it. These are children from this neighborhood, and they could not read the words. They did not know what they meant. Something from beyond reached out and began to scrub and scratch away the first letter, and I could feel myself dying."
"Brennan: Yeah, Rabbi Mike looks at you and goes like,"
Mike: That's an easy way to disanimate a golem is to just erase that first letter.
Kingston: We've been dealing with that kind of stuff all over the city.
"Lou: And I think I explain, I take some time to explain to them Null and kind of the stuff that we've been dealing with and Gladiator. And I'm like, we got plans with the other champions going down that we're working on, but anything you guys can do here in the neighborhood to be, you know, rectifying Null, would be greatly appreciated."
"Brennan: Rabbi Mike nods and says,"
"Mike: Okay, I can talk to people."
"Brennan: And Willy says,"
Willy: Are you keeping an eye out for anything around you that is trying to erase and stop them from doing this?
"Brennan: Willy looks up at you, Kingston, and says,"
Willy: Thank you for finding me.
"Brennan: Rabbi Mike nods his head and says,"
"Mike: This was a good call, Kingston."
"Brennan: And Willy goes,"
Willy: What brought you here to look for me in the first place?
"Kingston: Oh, well, it's not a pressing issue, so maybe we talk about it another time, but I don't know. It hit me a couple of days back, I've never really asked or thought about any of the other Vox Populi that came before me, so, I was just gonna come by and see if you'd ever run around with any of them."
"Brennan: You see Willy smiles and says,"
Willy: I knew the other Vox Populi.
"Brennan: And you see Willy looks back and kind of thinks and remembers, and gets a little bit sad. You see Mike looks up at Willy and nods and goes,"
Mike: Yeah.
"Brennan: Willy says,"
Willy: We should talk sometime about the other Voxes and the history of New York City.
"Brennan: He says,"
Willy: Right now I am going to make sure that I do not get erased again so easily.
"Brennan: Willy heads out to the street. As Mike walks out with you, he goes like,"
"Mike: I think that would be a good thing for you and Willy to talk about, the history of the Voxes in New York, man. That would be really good."
"Kingston: Hey, thank you, Mike. I really appreciate that. Hey, I appreciate you jumping into action, man. I know we're like 30 years out from the Met, but you still got it, man. You still got it."
"Mike: Hey, you know, I'm here for you to rely on me, all right? I'm happy to be of service, and Willy… Willy's a good… You know, it's… Do you know Willy's real history? Do you know much about him, talking about his past?"
"Kingston: I mean like, you know, only what he's wanted to talk about. I ain't no reporter, so I've never gone in on it, but, you know."
"Brennan: You see he looks at you and says,"
"Mike: Willy goes way, way back. You know, speech is an indication of the presence of a soul, and Hashem doesn't afford golems the ability to speak because true golems don't have that power, that ability, because that is an extremely special, divine gift. The word, the spoken word, the written word, is an extremely important gift. Willy is not only a golem, the reason Willy can talk and most golems can't is that Willy was a, or part of Willy was a man at one point. The Golem of Williamsburg that was created for him was created to hold the spirit of a man who gave his life to protect his family and his people. So Willy has a lot of history and has known a lot of Voxes and even knew one back when he was not the Golem of Williamsburg."
"Brennan: And you see Mike kind of smiles thinking about it. There's just, you know, a lot of heart to this golem you've known for a long time. He-"
"Ally: Such a cis male thing to be like, I never asked, I'm not a reporter."
(all laugh)
"Ally: About your fucking amazing backstory. “We just fucking play poker, look, I don't ask, were you a man?”"
"Lou: We just talk and hang out, you know?"
"Brennan: You see he looks at you and says,"
"Mike: Yeah, he's been around a long time. You know, there's actually this exhibit over at Ellis Island where you can see Willy in the background of one of the photos. There's this crazy wing that has a lot of like Unsleeping City stuff, like, hidden in it. He's been around a long time, man. A long, long time."
"Kingston: Hey, damn, Mike, I appreciate you… I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it. About how long he's been here. But yeah, I don't know, we'll have to get into that sometime."
"Brennan: Mike smiles. He looks at you and says,"
"Mike: It's great to see you again, man. The city's a big place. Look, even when I knew you when you were young, you know, knowledge of history is not… You were always a man focused on the present moment of what we can do for people today, and the world needs those people. And, I mean, memorizing ancient histories and knowing all the things that happened before, that's… I feel useful, is what I'm saying. I'm happy I'm around to be that person for you."
"Kingston: I'm glad we got brothers like you in the temple holding it down, so."
"Mike: That's what I'm trying to do every day, Kingston Brown, give me a break."
"Kingston: Yeah, big hug. Hey, go get everybody out there and please, stop shopping with Gladiator, all right? It's bad news."
"Mike: From the mouth of the Vox Populi, let it be so."
Brennan: And he gives you another big hug and heads back to Crown Heights. Let's go to Iga. What is Iga doing for her downtime activity?
"Siobhan: I think what I would like to do is sort of engage my network, my underground criminal network."
Brennan: Mm-hm.
"Siobhan: And even my kids, maybe, and have them be spreading the word about Gladiator."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: Through like posters, through stories, like maybe the kids can create a social media presence. Like, and even just like being in the community as I am in Greenpoint just, like, getting people talking."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: Getting the talking happening.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me a downtime persuasion roll, DC 20."
"Siobhan: Mm mm mm, nope. I'm gonna use a luck point."
Brennan: Go for it.
Siobhan: And a different die.
[Ally and Brennan laugh]
"Siobhan: Oh, so close! 17. I'll use another luck point, and another die."
Brennan: Here we go.
"Lou: There we go, keep them going."
Siobhan: 19.
Ally: Ooh!
Brennan: This is your last one! Last one!
"Siobhan: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna use it. Nope, I don't get it."
"Brennan: Oof, the dice didn't want it. It's all right."
Siobhan: Dice didn't want it. I have one other thing I want to do as well.
"Brennan: Cool, what's the other thing you want to do?"
"Siobhan: I would just like to see if… So we know the names of all of these CEOs and CFOs of Gladiator, et cetera?"
Brennan: Yes.
Siobhan: Can I see if any of their wives are people who take readings from me?
Brennan: [laughs] Go ahead and give me an investigation check.
Siobhan: Great. 12?
"Brennan: A lot of their wives are not people that have come to you for readings, and you think that's suspicious because they run in the same circles. So there's a suspicious lack of, like, interaction with you in that way. While you are working this week on like getting your criminal network out, Jess and Nick ask during this week to actually go into the box with you, if that's okay."
"Iga: Yes, absolutely."
"Brennan: This is Nick's first time traveling into the chest. You go in, the realm is resplendent, stretching in all directions. Mountains, forests, there's like a desert on the horizon now, there's like an ocean somewhere else, it's like this vast, fantastical realm. Jessica takes off immediately to go find Smoczmatka and talk to her and study her. You see the dragon mother down in a forest glade talking to Jessica. You see Nick is wearing his hoodie and sneakers and has the peasant's sword tied to his back, and he looks up at you, and you see he takes off going into the depths of the castle."
"Iga: Nick, you know it's not a toy. Where are you going? Don't touch things in here! Some of them are very cursed!"
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"Nick: I'm not gonna touch anything. Not gonna touch anything, mom."
Iga: Where are you going?
"Brennan: He looks up at you and says,"
Nick: Do you want to come?
"Iga: Yeah, I'll come."
"Brennan: He walks sort of silently. Nick walks down with you. You see, quivering in the old dragon's hoard, hiding there, are all the ghosts of your family."
"Iga: Oh my god, why are you scared? You're hiding behind the cage because the dragon is on the other side of the cage?"
"Ancestor: The dragon, she breathes fire on us, and we can't die but it still hurt very bad!"
Iga: You already have the answer. You say it out loud already. You can't die! You are ghosts!
"Ancestor: Yes, but it is very scary!"
Iga: You're bad influences!
"Brennan: You hear Jessica laughing outside with the dragon. Nick walks up, unsheathes the peasant's sword, and you see he goes,"
"Nick: Hey grandma and great grandma and great great grandma and all the grandmas. I'm Nick. I was never supposed to come into the chest, really, or do stuff here. I know my mom,"
"Brennan: And he looks at you and says,"
"Nick: I know my mom freed the dragon, and I know that that's really upsetting to you guys, and I know that Jess is like becoming a wizard. So I wanted to offer up myself because I don't think it should end here. Like, I don't think, I don't think the chest is gonna end, I think that the dragon rules this space now is good, but also, like, and mom, like, you said it. Like, we're not done."
Siobhan: I'm just bawling.
"Brennan: He's like,"
"Nick: We're not done paying it back. Mom broke the cycle of, like, people in our family not confronting their past and not knowing where their traditions come from, and I think it's awesome that Jess is like free because of that, and I think it's awesome that mom is like connected to the dragon because of that. So what I'm saying is, if all of you are super PO'd that there's not, like, anyone that's gonna like follow the old ways or the traditions, I'm gonna offer myself up on the condition that you guys give me all those secrets and let me be magic, 'cause I want to be magic too, and I'm just, I'm not gonna… I'll protect the chest, but I'm not gonna use all this power just to keep it secret forever. I'm gonna use it to make right what was wrong, and even if this dragon is free, there's a lot of other creatures out there that probably aren't. They're probably trapped like this, and I think you guys should give me your powers so that… So that we can use them to do something instead of do nothing."
"Brennan: The ancient witch turns to look at you, Iga, and is like,"
Ancestor: Who is this boy? Why he here in the castle?
Iga: He is my son. He's Nicholas. He's your great great grandson. He's a good boy.
"Brennan: Iga, Nicholas is holding the sword here and has offered to basically not let this, like, warlock tradition of the chest die out, but you can tell, basically, like, you can tell that he doesn't have the power to like hold these ghosts to this bargain."
Siobhan: Do I have that power?
Brennan: You think you probably do.
Siobhan: Then I use it.
"Brennan: Your ancient ancestor goes like,"
"Ancestor: First of all, a boy to do chest magic? Crazy, would never work. Number two, ah!"
Brennan: And you hold your hand aloft and the ghosts swirl around Nicholas's sword. He becomes a first level Hexblade Warlock.
(all cheering)
"Brennan: Of the chest, and you see that your mother smiles and says,"
Iga’s Mother: Nicholas is a good boy.
Iga: He's a good boy.
Brennan: And that-
"Iga: Do I wish he'd told me he was going to do this before we did this? Absolutely yes I wish he would've told me, but yes."
Nick: I thought you might say no! I thought it was a good idea!
"Brennan: He smiles, gives you a big hug, and is like,"
"Nick: Hey mom, if there's like some secrets about how the chest works or like warlock stuff, you could always teach me."
"Iga: Teach you. I'll teach you. Well, the first rule is don't come down here, so I guess that's that, ugh."
"Brennan: Incredible. You guys mosey on out to outside, laugh with the dragon, Smoczmatka smiles at you and your two magic kids, magic brother and sister. Sofia, your downtime. What's Sofia doing during her downtime?"
"Emily: I guess Sofia's just gonna try to raise money for Pete, go to meetings. She wants to talk to Kingston, but Kingston's been busy, so I think she's just gonna, also at night, just gonna write down stories about Dale to tell the baby."
Lou: Oh my god.
(all groaning)
"Brennan: Sofia, I'm gonna ask. In terms of your downtime here, are you gonna prioritize, 'cause you could absolutely make a living and do these hair appointments, but are you prioritizing meetings during this period of downtime, or are you prioritizing getting this money?"
Emily: I can't do both?
"Brennan: You can do both, because I'm gonna say that making money is like a normal activity, but."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: But I might make you roll with disadvantage unless you prioritize going to those meetings.
"Emily: I mean, I will have to, I think that I was… I think that I was, like… This is hard, because I definitely felt comfortable prioritizing working, 'cause I felt like I actively had endangered everyone because of Tony, so I was cool to prioritize work for that. However, Pete really hooked me up, but I also know that in order to show up for my friends, I don't want to be a liability, so I guess I will prioritize meetings. I'll sell some of my stuff, too. Like, is there any way I can make quick cash? Does my mom, like, have any money? I could borrow it from her."
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. Well, I'll say this. You prioritize meetings, so you… You move up to a D10. I'm gonna say, let's go ahead with that hair appointment stuff. Looking at Sofia's proficiencies, I think she actually does have a hairdressing proficiency, unless I'm mistaken."
"Emily: I don't have it on my sheet, but that's funny."
"Brennan: It's under tools, it says hairdressing."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: So that's gonna be a plus nine, so all you have to do is, you can roll with disadvantage, you just need the lower one to be an 11 or higher."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: And then we can talk about borrowing money, but let's see what happens."
"Emily: Okay. 15 and a 16, yes!"
(all cheer)
Murph: Oh my god!
"Brennan: Sofia is prioritizing meetings, there are so many dark brunettes that are desperate to get their hair bleached."
"Emily: I talked them all out of it because I was like, it's really really tough on your hair, it's gonna be like a really long process that in the long run you might regret, but now I'm just like,"
"Sofia: Yeah, let's see you blonde!"
"Brennan: At the end of that week, Sofia, you are able to hand Pete a stack, 2,500."
"Ally: I weep. I'm just bawling. Like,"
"Pete: No, we'll get this back to you!"
Sofia: I don't need it!
"Ally: I think I tell her about how someone paid, and I just tell her about all that sketchy stuff, and we're not quite sure what happened, but."
Emily: Can I do an insight check if I think it was secretly Kingston?
Brennan: Do an insight check.
Emily: 13.
Brennan: You don't think it was Kingston.
Emily: Really?
"Brennan: As you're there, both of you make a perception check."
"Emily: Whoops, hold on, cocked."
"Ally: 11\. Oh, sorry."
Emily: I got a 18.
"Brennan: Sofia, you see Pete on his smartphone has like a zillion notifications on his mail app, his like email of just like unread spam and stuff. You get a sense about his mail."
Pete: What's up?
"Sofia: Have you checked your email? Maybe there's like something from Lugash saying, “hey, I hooked you up,” or are you being spied on by Gladiator because of your mail?"
"Brennan: Pete, you remember how many bumper email addresses you have that you haven't checked 'cause you haven't been dealing in a while."
"Pete: Oh yeah, I just have a ton of like, yeah. I mean, yeah, there's never anything in there, right?"
"Ally: I, like, scroll."
"Brennan: On your third bumper email, you see an email from a woman named Maddie Park."
Emily: Oh. It's the PI.
"Brennan: The PI. You see she says,"
"Maddie: Hey Pete, 53\/3N told me it was cool to contact you here. I need to write you an extremely sincere apology. I've been working as a… I've been doing black hat work for a long time and working as a PI. I haven't always taken jobs that I was proud of, but my stomach was turned and my heart completely shattered when I found out that your transphobic family had hired me to find you, something I never, ever, ever would've done if I'd known. I've been fucked up by this knowledge for years, I'm much more careful now than I was when I was in my early 20s and first started doing this work, but I know that apology's not enough. Actions speak louder than words. I settled your debt with 53\/3N. I hope, this is not a huge cost to me, I see it as returning the money and then some that your shitty family paid me for in order to find you and put you in harm's way. If there's ever any other way I can repay the debt, (free work,) happy to help, let me know. I hope all is well with you. From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry. Maddie."
"Ally: I email immediately my actual phone number and say,"
Pete: Let's meet up soon.
"Pete: We have a black hat hacker that owes me a favor. We need to get all of this Gladiator stuff to her, we need to fucking take them down. Wow! Cool!"
Brennan: Hell yes. So you guys contact Maddie. We're running-
Sofia: Maybe she could get my tablet running.
"Brennan: [laughs] The last thing, I think, everyone's rolled for downtime stuff, and I'm gonna say Kingston, you did a ton of like going out to these different places and doing this stuff. So you guys reach out to Maddie Park. Pete, you get a text on your phone from Maddie, going,"
Maddie: Hey Pete.
"Brennan: And you see that it's using, like, some weird signal, like, it comes in like a weird app that like auto-downloads on your phone."
Ally: Love.
"Brennan: And it says,"
Maddie: Going after Gladiator? I'm in.
Brennan: And that's all for this episode of The Unsleeping City. Tune in text week.
Ally: Sick.
Brennan: For more thrilling adventures.
(Brennan hisses)
Ally: Incredible.

"(The Unsleeping City music is here, folks)"
"Brennan: Hello, one and all, and welcome back to another exciting episode of ""The Unsleeping City."" I'm your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes."
"Brennan: Oh, we love it. Last we left off our champions of New York City, they were scattered around the city bearing down on the final piece of the puzzle, the mystery of how to defeat Null and its physical presence in the waking world, Gladiator Industries. Indeed, the entity from beyond the Sixth Borough in the deep Dreaming has manifested in the world through the machinations of this massive conglomo-corp. We see that our allies, after consulting with their dear infinite friend Kugrash found out the true nature of Null, Null's relationship to Gladiator and the foibles, regrets, and heroic acts of sacrifice made by the previous Dragon of Bleecker Street and the fact that they were fighting a war on two fronts, a physical war against Gladiator Industries in the Waking World and needing to bring a dragon of New York back. Realizing that they had already gotten far on their way to bringing a dragon of New York City back, our champions had gathered the three spirits of New York as brought into trinity by Kugrash himself who were created by the original Dragon of Bleecker Street. After conferring with the Shen family, friends of Kingston Brown down in Chinatown who know all about that good, good dragon lore and were able to talk all about what dragons need as they are born and growing, and also what to do, like the nature of dragons relying on their hoard. The incomplete hoard, seven objects that Kugrash said Null had destroyed, but maybe not fully destroyed because Kugrash was still able to remember them. So even though they were gone, they were not erased from all parts of the cosmos. Our champions got Willy reanimated by Kingston's ally and friend Rabbi Mike Salter. We had a contact with one hacker named Maddie Park who is apparently a hacker that paid off Pete's debt although not really, Pete's debt was paid off from a lot of hair dying done by Sofia Lee who managed to turn a lot of brunettes blond against her own better judgment. It's serving the greater—"
Emily: Staten Island is very blond now. (laughs)
"Brennan: Oh no, serving the greater good, gang. Additionally, Cody and Rick dive into sword lore, unmade Thirsting Blade Dark Excalibur Mega-Genesis. Cody hawked Mega-Genesis and Dark Excalibur to pay rent and now has the Questing Blade. Ricky still has his magic axe. And the Peasant Sword was given to Nick Lisowski who is choosing to become a warlock to carry on a different, more mindful version of his mother's tradition. Our heroes of New York City are still gathering resources and preparing for this inevitable showdown. Pete and Sofia have just gotten in touch with Maddie Park. Let me ask Pete, would you make plans to see Maddie immediately and go talk to her?"
"Ally: I think so, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool. So Pete, you make plans to go see Maddie. We're actually gonna start though with Sofia Lee. Sofia, you have been writing letters to Dale. You were using your first week of downtime for—"
"Emily: Not writing letters to Dale. I was writing letters about Dale. All this talk of forgetting history, it was like, I need to write down everything I can remember about him so that the kid can know."
"Brennan: You write extensive letters about Dale. As you do so, you also, where does Sofia go to her meetings? 'Cause your mom goes to the nearby church which is the closest place that an AA meeting happens, but I'm not sure..."
"Emily: I think probably just somewhere convenient on Staten Island 'cause it's not like, you know, it's pretty inconvenient to get anywhere else. And any excuse to not go to a meeting you would probably take."
Brennan: Right.
Emily: So she needs the one that's on Staten Island.
Ally smiles.
"Brennan: So she goes to the local one. You end up sort of walking up the stairs. You see there's like, you know, Staten Island neighborhood. You can see the bay. There's some construction going on next to the church. You look up the steps. You see your mom coming down the steps out of mass as you're headed up for the door down to the basement."
"Sofia: (laughs) Hello, Mother."
"Brennan: She says,"
Maria: Sofia! You're here early for afternoon mass.
"Sofia: Oh, no, no, no, I'm here for meetings, Mom. Do you know how I go to those meetings?"
Maria: Right.
Sofia: And they help keep me on track.
"Maria: No, I remember. I'm just glad you're going to church. Basement, pews, I'm glad you're in church. That's all I'm gonna say."
(laughing)
Brennan: She looks at you and you see a sort of mothering look in her eye. She's gonna roll an insight check.
(dramatic instrumental music)
Emily: Can I roll a deception?
"Brennan: You can roll a deception, yeah. She rolled a natural two. (laughs) She looks and she says,"
"Maria: Well, you look wonderful, sweetie. You look like, I don't know, glowing."
Sofia: Thank you.
Maria: You look lovely.
Sofia: I've been exercising. That's why I've been away so much.
"Maria: I'm glad you're taking care of your body because, honey, you've got a lot of years left. You got tons and tons of years ahead of you so you know, I'm glad you're taking care of yourself, that's all. Sweetheart, have a good time at your meeting, okay?"
"Sofia: I will, I will. I got some sandwiches and there's some in the fridge."
"Brennan: She smiles and says,"
"Maria: Oh, good, I'm starving. I'll go help myself."
"Brennan: She gives you a kiss, goes back off to the apartment. You go to your meeting, you know, it's good. You're putting in the work. As you are walking out, go ahead and make a perception check for me."
Emily: 19.
"Brennan: Yeah, I think Sofia walks up. It's holiday time, Christmas lights are going up. You're looking at the stained glass here in this old Catholic church. See a lot of angel iconography and quickly kind of excuse yourself off to the street. You see La Gran Gata sort of appears in a shimmer around your shoulders. La Gran Gata looks very somber and sad and nuzzles into your leopard-print sweater and says—"
"Sofia: Why, what's wrong, hi."
"Brennan: She looks at you and says,"
"La Gran Gata: My champion, Sofia Lee. You are, I have seen you writing these letters, and I know that you have questions that need to be answered. I feel like we should go for a walk, you and I perhaps, and seek answers. You know, you must always be prowling around to find the secrets."
Sofia: Okay.
"La Gran Gata: They are always in dark corners, hidden places."
"Sofia: Yeah, you know, usually it's dogs that need to go for a walk. But yeah, I could take you for a walk, hon."
[La Gran Gata meows and licks her paw]
"Brennan: Smiles, says,"
"La Gran Gata: By the way, I love this new leopard-print sweater."
Sofia: Thank you. Pete got it for me.
"La Gran Gata: Pete, he has picked very well. This is an old leopard-print sweater, it's very magical."
Sofia: What?
"Brennan: And you see La Gran Gata dips into the sweater. Pete got this sweater for you, and unbeknownst even to Pete in a bout of wild magic, this is actually a magic sweater of spell storing that is on your person. You can check your character sheet for the powers after we're done running this scene for you."
Ally: What?
Emily: (laughs) Oh!
"Brennan: I wasn't gonna let such a sweet, when Pete does something sweet and magical, real magic happens."
Ally: (laughs) Aw.
"Brennan: Hell, yeah."
Emily: Wow.
"Brennan: You see, you head out to the street. Snow is flurrying around. It's like a snowy day in New York which means that it's very pretty but also gray, gray, gray clouds. You start walking past the construction site. You hear a catcall whistle (whistling noise) from the construction site as you're walking by."
"Emily: I kick out their knees, put 'em in a headlock."
"Brennan: [pounds his fists and laughs] Sofia, you turn around to find the guy who did it who's a little ways away. You see that there's sort of this thicker dude who sort of whistled. You see there's another dude, like Carhartt jacket, flannel, he's got the hat on. You see see he's by a buzzsaw cutting some two- by-fours. Looks like a handsome mid-thirties Middle Eastern guy who looks over at this dude and is like,"
"Carpenter: Dude, that's not you, man, that's not you."
"Brennan: And you watch the guy who whistled at you look so fucking ashamed and look at you and say,"
"Cat Caller: Ma'am, I'm very sorry."
"Sofia: No, honestly, the fact that you called him out, it means more than if I had called him out so thank you for that."
"Brennan: You see that the ashamed-faced guy sort of walks away. The other dude walks over to you and says,"
"Carpenter: Hey, ma'am, I'm so sorry. You're literally walking out of church. He doesn't know what he's doing. He's a confused guy. He is better than that, I'm sorry."
"Sofia: It's absolutely fine. You know, I call it out but I don't hold a grudge."
"Carpenter: Well, in any case, happy holidays."
"Brennan: You see he looks at you just sort of in this sweater and he's like,"
Carpenter: Are you not cold at all?
"Sofia: Oh, no, I run hot, yeah. Are you cold? Happy holidays to you as well, I'm sorry."
"Carpenter: No, it's all right."
"Brennan: You see he looks and says,"
"Carpenter: If you want this jacket, I'm working hard over here, I'm building up a sweat, so if you want it you can have it."
Emily: Can I do some kind of insight?
"Brennan: Yeah, give me an insight check."
(soft instrumental music)
"Emily: 19, is this like a magical jacket or is this just a nice person being nice?"
"Brennan: I think you get a sense that it's a nice person being nice, but I also don't think you would rule out magic. There's some kind of Unsleeping City vibe on this person."
Emily: Do I get the sense that it would make them feel good if I took the jacket?
"Brennan: Yeah, you do."
"Sofia: Okay, actually, you know what, I was putting on a brave face. That would be amazing."
Carpenter: I thought so.
Sofia: Yeah.
Carpenter: I thought you looked kind of cold.
Sofia: Thank you so much.
"Brennan: Takes this Carhartt off, wraps it around you. He goes,"
"Carpenter: Uh, got any plans for Christmas?"
"Sofia: Um, I uh, no, no. I'm sure I'll do something with my mother for as long as I have to. I'll probably attend church with her and then, I don't know, I'll probably see if any of my friends are around, although they all have families."
"Carpenter: Gotcha, are you, so I take it 'cause you're gonna be with your mom that you're single at the moment?"
"Sofia: Okay. (chuckles) This is incredibly flattering, but I am not in a dating place."
"Carpenter: Oh,"
Brennan: He says—
"Sofia: Thank you though. You know, it's very flattering to be seen in that way."
"Carpenter: I don't want to give you the impression. Obviously, hey, whatever guy would be lucky, but I'm not looking to date anybody right now either."
Sofia: Oh.
"Carpenter: So I was just asking because it's, you know, I feel like we should all feel like we're one big family during the holidays."
"Sofia: Yeah, I have a, yeah. I mean, do you have people to spend the holidays with, I hope?"
"Carpenter: I try to spend the holiday with as many people as I can, but you know, that gets hard sometimes. But I don't know, it breaks my heart that this can be a hard time of year for people."
"Sofia: No, I'm absolutely with you. I agree, and if anything, you know, you made my day a little better so I'm gonna take that and try and make someone else's day a little better. And hey, just in case you were reaching out to me as like, oh, you're looking to make friends, here's my phone number. But not in that way though because I am a widow who is comfortable being that for the time being."
"Brennan: He looks at you and goes,"
"Carpenter: Oh my God, I'm so sorry for your loss. (soft instrumental music) What was your spouse's name?"
Sofia: My husband was Dale Lee.
"Carpenter: I'm so, so sorry. If I can ask, how many years has it been since Dale passed?"
Sofia: It's been probably almost three.
"Carpenter: Those wounds stay sharp and painful for a long, long time and especially around a time of year like this. That's gotta be really, really hard."
"Sofia: Yeah, but I am not the only person in the world to deal with that so, you know, I think if the wounds stay open forever that's okay. People learn to live with lots of different wounds."
"Brennan: He sort of opens his eyes and he's like,"
"Carpenter: Yeah, no kidding, that's the truth. Yeah, we all have our own cross to bear. We all have our own pain in our own way, but you have to forgive me, I mean."
"Brennan: You see he points to the church next to him and just says,"
"Carpenter: I know for a fact that there is love coming to you from him. I know there is. I'm sorry if that's forward, but sometimes we need to remind each other that that never goes away."
"Sofia: Okay, yeah. Thanks for checking in on me."
Carpenter: You got it.
"Sofia: I wish I could check in on you, too."
"Brennan: You see he smiles and says,"
"Carpenter: I appreciate that, yeah. Come and check in on me sometime, I'll be around. I got tons of stuff, I got a bunch of carpentry stuff I gotta handle, so you're all good."
Sofia: Cool.
"Carpenter: Have a wonderful day. And hey, it's Christmas time, miracles can happen."
Brennan: And he smiles and goes back to work. And I think that's the end of that. You can give me one last Perception check if you want.
Emily: [sighs] 26.
"Brennan: That's very good. You're walking away for a moment. You clock his hammer in his belt loop, like a lot of professional union carpenters, has his initials on the top. You're like a block and a half away. The initials on the hammer were J.C."
Siobhan shakes her head.
[players chortling]
Sofia: Jesus fucking Christ.
[players crack up]
Sofia: Really? Oh my fucking God.
"Lou: Wild, wild."
"Sofia: Oh, my mother would have loved to have met you."
"Brennan: Yeah, I think Sofia is reasonably stunned in this moment. You've met a lot of divine beings before and a lot of, but this was a wild one. And I think you flash to Kingston and think about a conversation you've been putting off having with Kingston for a while."
"Emily: Oh, Jesus. [groans] Yeah, I guess I probably, it's been, it's just, Kingston's really busy and it feels more selfish and not direct to everything that's going on. So I guess I'll just text Kingston and just say, um,"
"Sofia: Hey, would love to grab coffee at some point when your schedule permits. We're all really busy though. Sorry, I'm super high from all the chemicals I've been putting in women's hair."
"Lou: Yeah, I think Kingston texts back,"
"Kingston: Okay, hahaha. Would love to grab coffee. Sorry, sorry, Gladiator's got me all out of sorts. But yeah, would be great to talk."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool, Kingston, you are coming back at a sort of odd time. You've been running around the city with this egg. And you come back—"
[Ally laughs]
"Lou: Me and this egg, just getting around town."
Brennan: Getting around—
Siobhan: It's the buddy comedy of the year.
"Brennan: Buddy comedy of the year, exactly."
Lou: Kingston and The Egg.
Siobhan: It also does sound like a shop in Williamsburg.
Murph: Kingston and the Egg.
"Siobhan: Hey, I'm going to Kingston and the Egg, they sell really nice candles. They're $800 each."
"Brennan: Kingston, you arrive home at a kind of strange time with this dragon's egg. As you arrive home with the egg you open your apartment door. Go ahead and make a perception check for me."
"Lou: [chuckles] Happy to. Oh, nat one."
"Brennan: Cool, you walk upstairs and see a lot of forms and stuff sort of around Liz's work area. And I think Kingston, on a 1 perception you don't notice any noises from anywhere else, but Liz should be home right now and you know that she's not."
"Lou: Well, I'll text Liz and just be like,"
"Kingston: Hey, rough day. They got Willy. He's okay now, but would love to talk to you about him."
Brennan: You see Liz shows up not that long after like she was downstairs at your mom and dad's. She comes back upstairs. Give me an Insight check.
"Lou: Oh, here we go again. Yeah, that'll be a 29."
"Brennan: Liz quickly moves a lot of papers off her desk into a file cabinet in a way that's just a little bit speedy to you like she's just putting something away really quickly. And she says,"
"Liz: Kingston, hi, what's going on."
"Kingston: Yeah, I just wanna, it's just been so much. Is everything all right at work, everything good?"
Brennan: You see that she—
Kingston: You seem like you were going through it.
"Liz: Yeah, I'm okay, you know. It's a busy time. But I don't want to stress you out with anything. I know you are doing—"
"Kingston: No, no, no, no, no, no. What's going on, what's going on?"
Liz: Oh...
"Brennan: She doesn't attempt to lie to you. She opens the desk and takes the papers out. She goes,"
"Liz: Um, I didn't want to talk to you because I was pretty sure the answer was gonna be no and it was."
"Kingston: No, hey, hey now, all right. That's not how things work in this house, right? Nothing is certain until you say it out loud and we discuss it so please, let me know what's going on, Liz."
Brennan: She defeatedly sort of flops some papers over to you. And you see a number of form letter responses from three different adoption agencies—
[Lou chuckles]
"Brennan: That basically de facto rule out even sending someone to come and look at your apartment. Just like, two full-time professionals, a legal professional and a medical professional, no prior child-raising experience, both in their late 50s. And Liz looks and just sort of goes like,"
Liz: I'm sorry. I didn't even want to bring it up to you.
"Kingston: No, no, no—"
Liz: 'Cause it's nothing. This is nothing.
"Kingston: Hey, hey."
"Lou: I bring Liz in, just big hug, big, intimate, quiet hug."
"Liz: It's probably for the best, we're busy and, you know, what, are we gonna be 70 years old with a kid in college? And it's crazy, I just thought, you know, there was like Thanksgiving with your mother and father. And I like, I just thought it was like, you just get a wild idea and you chase something down a rabbit hole for a second."
Kingston: Yeah.
Liz: And you shouldn't get your hopes up and I...
"Kingston: Mm-hmm, hey, it's all, hey, I've been there. You know, I've been there quietly with myself 1,000 times wondering what it would be like to be a 70-year-old dad, what, moving my kid into college. I mean, it feels like that, but I mean, it's an honest and it's a real feeling. And I wish and I hope I didn't do anything to make you think you couldn't bring that to me. 'Cause I don't know, it's a feeling I've had and maybe should have brought to you. But you know, this feels just kismet in terms of a time to mention something like this. But I've been running around town with this giant egg."
Lou: I just produce the egg.
Liz: Oh.
"Kingston: Yeah, so..."
Ally: (laughs) “Oh.”
Liz: Congrats on your— on your egg? Is it a—
"Kingston: It's congratulations to you as well, possibly, if you're interested. 'Cause this is a dragon's egg. And I, uh… it's gonna hatch and someone's gonna have to take care of it and raise it. I was down with the Shen family. You know the Shen family down in Chinatown."
Liz: Yeah.
"Kingston: Got the big, it opens up and it's like everyone flies there—"
"Liz: Sorry, hold on."
"Kingston: Yeah, anyway, so I—"
Liz: You said raise a dragon's egg?
"Kingston: Yeah, anyway, you know, have you had green tea? Imma get some green tea for us. I brought these green teas from China. You have to have a green tea."
Liz: Is there a little floating cloud in our kitchen? What is that?
"Kingston: Yes, and it's filled with green tea. But yeah, I did say raise this dragon and I know it's not a—"
"Liz: What do you mean, raise a dragon? Like a dungeon dragon like it's gonna—"
"Kingston: No, no, it's not. It's more a spirit than a monster. It's not so much like a gnashing teeth, breathing fire sort of thing. It's kind of like the dragon that kind of brought me into The Unsleeping City and kind of took care of the city and held on to its history and its past and its culture and treasured that. And I don't know if you're open to it. I know that I am. I don't know, some of the other champions kinda suggested the idea that we kind of raise... and... foster... this spirit of the city."
[Brennan and Ally laugh]
"Kingston: [starts monologuing] I'm wondering if you, it's not a child. Like, we won't get to move the dragon into college. Like, that's not gonna happen at all. But I mean, the dragon's also gonna live for hundreds of years, like, long past when we. So I don't know, it's a lot, it's a lot. I'm saying a lot of things and I'm putting a lot on you right now. And if you want to take some space and think about it and we could talk later. But I really want this, I really want this really badly. And I care about this egg so much so quickly. I don't know. But I love you and I want you. And I feel like I've been talking for two minutes straight and I'm just gonna drink green tea and you talk and we'll just go from there. We just go from there. Imma drink this, Imma put green tea in my body and you just talk and you feel the space that I'm feeling with my, what is clearly anxiety over (sighs) that you might not want to raise this dragon with me in which case I would have to (sighs) I don't know. I guess Iga could raise the dragon if you don't want to raise the dragon, that's perfectly fine so if you say no there's options. So there's room for you to say no. I just want to say that. Like, it's not gonna be like that if you, oh, I was gonna drink some green tea. All right, where's that green tea? All right, and now you talk."
[Ally is stifling giggles]
Brennan: She is massaging her temples and goes.
[Ally laughs]
"Kingston: Okay, I can keep talking if you want me."
Liz: No.
Kingston: Okay.
"Liz: No, no, no, no, no, no, that's enough."
"Kingston: Okay, great, that's what it felt like. It felt like that was enough."
[pause]
Liz: Do I have to hatch the egg?
"Kingston: No, absolutely not. I don't think you biologically have to do anything."
Liz: Okay.
"Kingston: Other than, like, it would just be like, it would honestly be like we get to skip that part, like the nine month thing and we get to skip that. I mean, I do have to bring together a rat, or excuse me, a cockroach, a unicorn, and a pigeon and that's, I guess, kind of the birthing process. But you don't have to be there for any of that. And I don't think it's like a duck or anything where like the first thing it sees so you need to be there. So I think like, you can 100% come in later down the road on your timeline."
"Liz: Huh, okay."
Ally covers their face to stifle their laughter.
Liz: Um...
"Kingston: You can say no. I just want to make it clear. Like, you don't have to be in."
"Liz: I think, Kingston, you're giving me anxiety with your anxiety."
"Kingston: Sorry, I'm sorry."
"Liz: I'm trying to catch up to where you've been over a couple days, just in like a minute or two."
"Kingston: Yep, yeah, I know."
"Liz: So this dragon, does it, it looks like a dragon?"
"Kingston: I don't know, they can shapeshift. I learned that the other day. I was hanging out with a dragon that was just like a straight-up kind of Eastern European woman that became a dragon then went back to being an Eastern European woman then went back to being a dragon and has kind of been in dragon state since, but it seems like there's flexibility."
"Liz: Okay. So listen, a lot of conversations."
Kingston: Yes.
"Liz: You know, I personally, okay, I think the only hurdles would be like a birth certificate. Like, you have to get a Social Security number. You have to get… Yes, yeah, yes, I'm in, I'm in. I will raise a dragon with you."
"Kingston: Okay. [exhales softly] Okay, yeah. We're gonna do it, we're gonna raise a dragon."
Lou: I think Kingston is maybe the happiest he's ever been in his whole life as he realizes he's going to get to raise a dragon with the love of his life.
[Brennan and Emily laughing]
Brennan: Incredible.
"Kingston: Yeah, that's the best news. That's the best news I've ever heard. And I'm gonna kiss you right now. I’mma kiss you right now right on the mouth to show you how much I love you."
Brennan: You both—
Kingston: And then maybe we can lay together.
"Brennan: You both kiss, go to bed that night."
"Lou: We lay together, Brennan, we lay together."
"Brennan: You lay together, in the biblical sense. You lay together in the biblical sense."
Ally: Then maybe we could lay together. (laughs)
Brennan: In the biblical sense you lay together.
Ally: Wow.
"Brennan: And that night, and this is sort of the end of that first week basically. Pete, you have plans to meet with Maddie the next day. But in your dreams... In your dreams you awaken in the Sixth Borough again."
(stirring piano music)
Brennan: But are hidden away from the sort of cosmos in some sort of rubble and stuff like that. And I think you feel something glowing in your own heart. [mimics heart beating]
"Ally: Okay, I kind of go inward to see what maybe that feels like."
"Brennan: You go inward as Vox Phantasma and [mimics reverberations] begin to travel through your own consciousness and go into the Sixth Borough within yourself. You walk through the hallways of your own heart and you can see the city pumping in time to your own heartbeat, and there's a tiny, little oil drum fire. And standing on a milk crate wearing their little gray dress is Nod. Nod has a big black eye, is missing a couple of teeth, but in that sort of rascally, like almost like a cartoon of an orphan. Like, black eye, teeth, little sort of cold compress on their head, arm in a sling and is by the fire and waves over at you, Pete, as you approach them."
"Pete: Nod, what happened?"
"Nod: Pete, Pete!"
Pete: What happened to you?
"Nod: Oh, I'm still mostly gone. This is the tiny, little part of me that I gave to you to make you the Vox Phantasma so this is the only part of me that still exists, in your heart!"
Ally: I grab them and I sprint to my spleen.
Brennan: [laughs] Cool.
Ally: And I hide them there? I don't know.
Brennan: Cool. You hide them even deeper in your body.
Ally: Heart is too obvious. I'm just running through my organs.
"Brennan: You see Nod goes,"
"Nod: Oh, this is a good idea, Pete. I'll hide even deeper in here, that's great."
"Brennan: You go and hide Nod in your fucking spleen. And as Nod looks up and you and says,"
"Nod: Good. I'm kind of like a hologram. Like, if you cut a little piece of me off, it's still the whole me, it's just itty bitty. Oh, I wanted to give you something. Kingston is the first Vox Populi that's ever healed something in the Dreaming, so I wanted to give you this."
"Brennan: And Nod takes a pure, golden dream. It is a contradiction. It is a dream made of the magic of the waking world. And goes and hands it to you and says,"
"Nod: I should stay hidden, but if you want to bring this to Kingston, you can."
Pete: What does this look like? What would he do with this?
Nod: It's his dream!
"Pete: It's his dream, like, that he already had?"
Nod: Yes.
Pete: Or it's a dream that he could have?
"Nod: No, it's his dream that he already had that I was holding onto."
Pete: Okay.
"Nod: But I think he should have it now, I think it's ready."
"Pete: Okay. Okay, thank you. What, are you gone? Like, did you get destroyed?"
"Nod: Mostly, if you die, then I'm permanently destroyed, but as long as you're alive I'm okay."
"Pete: Great, great."
"Nod: When you pick a Vox Phantasma, you get weaker because a fraction of yourself is in the Vox Phantasma, but it's honestly a pretty good idea because I'm still alive because you're still alive so clearly it's not a bad thing to do. But yeah, it would be great to get the rest of me back. So if you could defeat Null, that would be awesome!"
"Pete: (laughs) Yeah, definitely. We're working on that right now. Okay, okay. Do you have any idea, is there something that you want me to do when I wake up tomorrow in the real world or?"
"Brennan: You see they look at you and say,"
"Nod: I think you've got it in the real world. Because I'm not there in person, I just can't bring this to Kingston or to Liz myself so I thought if you could do it because I can't really run the Sixth Borough right now, that would be awesome."
"Pete: What is it? What's in the dream, or is that like—"
"Brennan: Pete, you can look right at it if you want to."
"Ally: I mean, that feels like reading someone's diary."
[Brennan sputters]
[Lou laughs]
"Ally: God damn it. I want to look so bad. Just know that, but I'm not going to."
Brennan: [laughs] Incredible.
"Ally: If he wants to share this with me when I drop it off we could watch it together like a movie. I mean, I think that sounds pretty cute. My popcorn recipe is perfected at this point."
[Siobhan and Emily laugh]
"Brennan: Pete, you perform your role as the Vox Phantasma. You shift through dreaming space away from the vision of Null where Null cannot see you. And you find the apartment of Kingston and Liz and deposit the dream therein. You've never seen Kingston dream before, but you deposit this dream direct from Nod there."
[warm piano music]
"Brennan: Though Kingston and Liz cannot see it, asleep in their bed with the dragon's egg beside them a form from the dream realm manifests within the dragon's egg of New York. And it's a dream of the child that Liz and Kingston would have. And that form, the spirit of the egg, the first thing it fully becomes is that dream of Kingston and Liz. And Kingston, you dream of you and Liz and a human child."
Lou: [smiles] It's the best sleep I've gotten in my entire time as the Vox Populi.
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: Amazing. Ricky, we're gonna cut over you to real quick. It's the next day, it's getting in to the early to mid-December. You come back home after working at Helping Hands and see that Patricia and Gabriela are here. And they're helping around. You see Patricia comes over and says,"
"Patricia: Oh, Ricky, so good to see you, darling."
Ricky: Good to see you. How's everyone doing? What's going on?
"Brennan: Esther has some Christmas decorations down. She has her mom and grandma over to decorate for Christmas stuff and you see that her grandma is clearly hectoring her and Esther's like,"
"Esther: Fine, I accept, I accept. Whatever you think is best."
Brennan: And you see that Esther is wrapping up her silver baseball bat and putting in a box to put up in the attic. You see that she puts it down.
"Zac: Wrapping it up, like? Oh, like not in a present, like it's like—"
"Brennan: Not in a present way, like in a putting it away way. Yeah, you see that Esther puts the bat away, looks over at you and says,"
"Esther: Hon, can you help me out? I'm having a, I'm just in a spell that's being indecisive. I feel like a staff, a full staff is unwieldy, but I don't want, like, a wand just for aesthetic reasons. A ring might be cool."
"Brennan: And you see Patricia says,"
"Patricia: Not a ring. It should be a staff, a scepter, or a wand!"
"Ricky: Wait, so what's wrong with the? I thought the bat was kinda cool. (laughs)"
"Brennan: Gabriela looks over and says,"
"Gabriela: Oh Ricky, you're so sweet, the bat is fine."
"Brennan: And you see Esther says,"
Esther: The bat is cool and I love the bat.
"Brennan: Gabriela looks at you, Ricky, says,"
"Gabriela: Esther was, while the curse still existed, going to become the Fury of Sorrow. We are furies no more, however, having the Staff of Sorrow or the Scepter of Sorrow."
"Brennan: And you see Esther says,"
Esther: Or the ring of sorrow.
"Brennan: And you see she says,"
Gabriela: Not a ring!
"Brennan: Esther says,"
"Esther: Basically my mom and my grandma are super powerful witches. They want to make me an official staff or a scepter that while nowhere near as cool as my baseball bat will have actual for real magic powers and cool stuff associated with it, so."
Ricky: Oh.
"Esther: And, you know, the bat's very cool, but also, you know, I'm the chairwoman. Maybe something with a little bit more pomp, I don't know."
"Brennan: And you see that Patricia says,"
"Patricia: Pomp is right. You should command respect. How can you command respect with a baseball bat, look like you're heading to practice."
[Lou and Zac laughs]
"Brennan: You see that Esther sort of rolls her eyes. She looks up at you and goes,"
"Esther: How are things going with the other champions, Voxes, everybody, Sofia, things are good?"
"Ricky: You know, there's kind of a lot going on. I think, you know, maybe we could have a little chat, you know, about that later. I don't know if it's a whole, you know, everyone's business or whatever. Sorry, I didn't mean that in any sort of..."
"Brennan: You see Gabriela raises an eyebrow and looks at Patricia and says,"
"Gabriela: Mom, I think we're being asked to leave."
"Ricky: No, I… [sighs] I didn't mean that in any way. You can stay forever, I want you to know that."
"Brennan: Esther says,"
"Esther: No you can't, no you cannot, no you can't."
"Ricky: Okay, all right."
[Ally laughs]
Brennan: You see that—
"Ricky: For what it's worth, I think, I mean, of those options I think a staff is kind of cool, but I don't know. Kind of a bat fan, yeah."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: You see that Patricia goes,"
"Patricia: We love a young man with sense, that's what we love."
"Brennan: And Esther says,"
"Esther: Fine, Grandma, a staff is wonderful. I will take a staff."
"Brennan: And you see Patricia and Gabriela say goodbye. They head out, Esther smiles, gives you a hug and a kiss. Says,"
"Esther: Yeah, things are going great. We are planning the retreat for the expedition, still conning those monks, all's well. Tony is such a dummy. He's bought it hook, line, and sinker."
"The camera flips to Emily, whose expression becomes very serious at the mention of Tony."
Esther: He's got like a detail of wizards helping him in the monastery that are looking at all the scrolls that he's pulling. Things are going wonderful. How are you?
Ricky: Great. [laughs]
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Esther: How are things going with you, sweetheart? I notice you have a fireman's axe again."
"Ricky: Yeah, oh yeah, we haven't even talked since then? Wow."
"Zac: So yeah, I think Ricky just explains the dreaming world fight and how he didn't take the sword."
"Ricky: And you know, like, feels like a longer story, but you know, at the end of the day, like, between like an insane sword or just a tool I'm used to, I kind of went with, I decided to go with the axe. But yeah, and, you know, other stuff is going on that I feel like maybe you should just chat with Sofia."
"Zac: I feel like it's, I don't know if Ricky feels comfortable just telling someone else that, even if it's his partner that she's pregnant just because they're close friends it feels like—"
"Brennan: Yeah, she says,"
"Esther: Yeah, I'll go talk to Sofia. That sounds wonderful."
"Ricky: We also have a dragon egg, there's a lot."
Esther: That's incredible.
Ricky: Yeah.
"Brennan: She looks and goes,"
"Esther: Yeah, that's incredible. Yeah, sweet pea, I know you're having a, you know, you're like, the legacy of Kugrash. And I know that you're struggling with that you don't want to be a rat druid, and I don't think you have to be that."
"Ricky: It would be cool, but it's not, you know, I would be lying if I said, number one dream is a rat druid."
"Brennan: She says,"
"Esther: I know you're looking for something, sweetie. You're gonna find it."
"Brennan: She kisses you, heads out. I think Rick, give me a Perception check, Ricky."
Zac: Ooh. Natural 20.
Lou: Brrrah!
Ally: Ooh!
"Brennan: Rick, you head for a walk and you are down by the water and you spot a fire truck kind of rolling by and see the Johns, and the Johns slow the fire truck down and they go,"
"Johns: Oh, it's Ricky Matsui!"
"Ricky: John, John, John."
Emily: So many fires untended to.
"Brennan: Big, big, big hugs all around. You see one of them looks at you and goes,"
"Johns: Whoa, dude, you got an axe? Are you with another truck right now?"
"Ricky: I'm, uh…"
Zac: Ricky's realizing it's a little crazy to just walk around with an axe I guess.
"Ricky: You know what, I'm not with a truck right now. I happened to find this bad boy somewhere weird and thought I should hang on to it, but you know what, I feel like y'all should hang on to it."
"Johns: Whoa, dude."
Ricky: I think it's like—
Johns: You just want to give us an axe you found?
"Ricky: It's a pretty sick fireman's axe and I think, well, I can't be that guy, right? I can't be the guy walking around town with an axe. You know, that feels intense."
"Brennan: The Johns look, take your magic firefighter axe and head back out."
Zac: Bye. (chuckles)
"Brennan: And I think Ricky, on that nat 20, you're looking around and I think you had your sorrowful goodbye with the Questing Blade. I think Ricky does feel free without the axe, that that was the right choice to get rid of that and now you're at the crossroad of all of crossroads. You feel totally unencumbered but are also like, so much of your meaning has come from things that other people imparted to you. Kugrash's legacy, his three spirits, the Hall of Heroes, being chosen by the Questing Blade. I think on a nat 20 Ricky is feeling a little bit rootless and a little bit like, empty. And I think you feel something moving within you with that feeling of directionlessness that a lot of other people in the city are feeling right now."
"Zac: Can I use Divine Sense? I feel like, I'm scared this is anti-Populi kind of territory."
"Brennan: Yeah, I think that—"
Zac: I don't know if that's exactly right.
"Brennan: You do Divine Sense and you get back a little bit of static. I think that it's not lethal, but I think Ricky has this moment of looking around and being like, there go my old friends with an axe that doesn't belong to me. The Questing Blade is in someone else's hands. The most helpful thing that I've done is uphold Kugrash's memory. And I think you look in your heart for like, what is uniquely Ricky Matsui's and you don't come up with an answer. And that little hole feels not great. And I think that it's a moment of you recognize you're feeling a fraction of what you saw JJ feeling that night that you spent time with him."
Zac: Maybe he'll go to the Occult Society and try to talk to JJ.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You go to find JJ. We're gonna cut from that over to, I'm gonna say, 'cause Pete's going to talk to Maddie. Cody and Iga, at the beginning of the next week is there anything you guys are gonna begin to do for that next chunk of downtime? Bearing in mind also that there's still all this stuff about these totems that are missing. I know, Iga, you had begun to make checks against Gladiator but for Cody and Iga, what are you guys up to that day? This is like the first Monday in December."
"Siobhan: Well, first of all Saint Nicholas's Day which is December 6th is very big in Poland. So I don't think that they do like a full Saint Nicholas's Day because the kids want to do presents on Christmas Day like they're American, but it's definitely like, they put their shoes out. And you know, they're teenagers now, but they put their shoes out. She leaves them some little gifts there. Like, that's an important thing for her. As much of anything it's like, a thing that was joyful from her childhood that she likes to pass on."
"Brennan: Yes. You have a wonderful Saint Nicholas's Day. Nick and Jess are getting along better than you've ever seen them get along before. And I think Smoczmatka, one of the times that you're in the chest remarks and says,"
"Smoczmatka: Iga, you have done truly well with these two. You should be very, very proud."
"Iga: Thank you, they're good kids, you know? I mean, even though they're teenagers, I mean, I haven't had any of the problems of teenagers. They're just good. I like them pushing against me a little bit. It's cute, you know? It just means they're growing up."
"Brennan: Smoczmatka smiles and nods and says,"
"Smoczmatka: Strong to stay that, and it is true and good."
Brennan: Your friendship with the dragon in the chest continues to blossom as its magical realm expands.
"Siobhan: One of the things I also was gonna pitch to Cody was like, maybe weirdly we can investigate them all together 'cause I have a lot of stuff that is about getting into places that I shouldn't be able to get into."
Cody: I am awesome at that.
"Brennan: Cody, you got all your new dope gear from selling those magic swords."
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, if you guys want to give me a little investigation check on the mall, go for it. Unless there's other stuff that Cody wanted to get up to."
"Murph: Yeah, I think just like continuing to learn about stuff so he's not just like a mindless consumer. And then I think he's also always kind of looking for a crusade."
Zac smiles.
"Murph: So I think he's specifically looking for local places that are being taken over by Gladiator so that he can throw Big Gulps at people and like, just like still being a—"
"Iga: Or no locally-produced Big Gulps. You know, you're still buying the Big Gulps and—"
"Murph: Yeah, that's true, he's like,"
"Cody: Fuck, a Big Gulp!"
Murph: He throws the Big Gulp in the 7-Eleven.
"Iga: Go to a local bodega, buy a frozen drink from them. Why are you going to a 7-Eleven buying that."
Cody: Right.
Ally: Oh my gosh.
"Brennan: Iga and Cody, give me investigation checks."
Murph: Sweet.
Siobhan: Great. I'm gonna Disguise Self myself as somebody who works for Gladiator.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: Whoa.
Siobhan: And I'm gonna use a luck point to re-roll that seven.
Murph: 13.
"Brennan: 13, cool."
Siobhan: 16.
"Brennan: 16\. You guys go to Gladiator. With that 16, Iga, you don't. First of all, Cody, you find an old piece of the Fairyland Amusement Park that used to be here. It's like, the backhoes dug it up from back when they built the mall. And you just see a little chunk of the sign that says Fairyland on that 13 of this old amusement park that used to be here. Iga, you find some equipment, disguised as you as a Gladiator employee. You also see here the mall—"
"Siobhan: Oh, I can actually disguise both of us as Gladiator employees."
"Brennan: Cool, cool."
"Siobhan: I forgot. I have Seeming, so I can use Seeming."
Murph: Cody just keeps punching himself in the leg.
Cody: Fucking Gladiator employee. [grunts]
"Brennan: Iga, first of all, there's an entire floor here of Sparties, those delivery drones. And you find another piece of equipment. It's on the back of the truck, it's enormous. You could potentially break a piece off of it or you could just take a picture of it because it looks like it has some familiarity to the readout that JJ had."
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: When you guys were at the Metropolitan Museum of Memories.
"Siobhan: Great, I would like to cast Remote Access on it."
Brennan: [mimics machinery booting up] You see it starts moving. You access it.
(suspenseful piano music)
"Brennan: New York Minutes are going into this machine as you turn it on and being flattened and destroyed to compress time. As you turn it on, it very quickly fucks up and breaks because it's not perfectly made. Like, you can tell from turning it on and how poorly it works when you turn it on that this is a prototype. It's like something they built to do this scary thing that they haven't built a working version of yet."
[suspenseful instrumental music]
Siobhan: Can I Remote Access also one of these droids?
Brennan: Sure. [mimics device powering up]
"Droid: [waves] Hi, I'm Sparty. I'm here to give you everything you need."
Siobhan: Can I sort of use this spell to do an Investigation check to see if there's anything other than delivery that it's programmed to do?
"Brennan: Yeah, give me an Investigation check."
Siobhan: How good is this 45-year-old woman at technology? A 10.
"Iga: Where does the button, Cody, which is the button for the thing?"
"Cody: Um, I only know how to break stuff, if you want me to like kick it or something 'cause this thing fucking sucks."
"Iga: Yes, maybe."
[Siobhan laughs]
"Brennan: You fuck around with it. You don't see, like, a kill people switch on it. It just looks like a drone that walks around and delivers packages, but you do have the knowledge of that scary-ass machine."
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: We're gonna move to—
Murph: And I guess I'll also take that Fairyland sign.
"Brennan: Cool, yeah, go ahead and throw that in your inventory."
"Murph: A little piece of it, great."
"Emily: A whole sign? Oh, it's a piece of a sign."
"Murph: Yeah, it's a piece of a sign."
"Brennan: It is a lovely morning in a coffee shop in Harlem. Kingston, you've just had the best sleep of your life, kissed Liz off on her way to work, has this beautiful dream. The egg when you woke up feels now warm to the touch. Life is good. You are getting coffee with Sofia Lee. Sofia, La Gran Gata again appears around your shoulders, smiling again, and you walk by a bodega here. La Gran Gata moves into it, goes and helps Cosmo out on Kingston's corner. But yeah, you meet up with Kingston for coffee."
[chill jazzy instrumental music]
"Sofia: Hi, Kingston."
"Kingston: Hey, what's up, Sofie?"
Sofia: How are you?
"Kingston: I'm good. I think, uh—"
Sofia: Yeah?
"Kingston: Yeah, it's been, I don't know, this Gladiator shit is heavy, is heavy."
"Sofia: I know, I know."
"Kingston: But I don't know. I really think we got this, I really do."
"Sofia: I think we do, too."
Kingston: Yeah.
Sofia: I've been setting myself straight. We're gonna knock this out of the park.
Kingston: Hell yes.
Sofia: I feel good about it.
"Kingston: How about you? I mean, you've had a, between the monastery and congratulations again on the baby and everything that's going on. I mean, you're going through it right now. I'm sorry if I haven't, you know, I've been all over."
"Sofia: No, as you should be."
Kingston: But you're important.
Sofia: As you should be. You are so much to so many people. And I'm honestly glad to see you taking a little time for yourself.
"Kingston: Thank you, I appreciate that. But you wanted to talk about something."
"Sofia: Yeah, after I say that I'm immediately coming to ask you for a favor."
"Kingston: Right, that's what I do. I mean, hey, if there's something I can do to help you, you let me know."
"Sofia: Okay. Okay, it's gonna be kinda hard for me to talk about, okay?"
Kingston: That's perfectly fine.
"Sofia: Okay. As you know, I'm with Dale's child."
"Kingston: God, yes."
"Sofia: And the thing is, I haven't told him yet, and I do have to tell him. The thing I'm holding out on is, I, you know. (sighs) Dale really wanted a kid, and I'm not trying to make his transition into a new life any harder, you know? And I just feel like if I just went up and said, hey, I'm pregnant, it would be kind of like just another thing he was missing out on."
Kingston: Yeah.
"Sofia: So I was kinda wondering, I guess I just, do you know anything about, you know, 'cause like, did you know anything about anyone who's able to like, like in the monastery there's some texts that refer to someone coming back to their old body after a really long time, you know?"
Kingston: Mm-hmm.
"Sofia: And like, you know, they don't really say that much more about it, but I was wondering if there's any way for a person to come back after a really long time? I know that's a crazy thing."
Kingston: It's not crazy.
Sofia: And you know—
Kingston: It's not crazy.
"Sofia: It's just like a little dream I've been trying to keep in my heart without letting it turn into a need, but at this point now I feel like I need to at least address it before I tell him 'cause if there's any opportunity then I go to him and say, I'm working on this, instead of just, I'm having your baby and you're not here for it."
"Kingston: Yeah. Hey, it's not crazy. I mean, yeah, you're with his child. I mean, of course your head goes here and is asking these questions. Hmm, I mean, the answer is that is nearly impossible, but it is not wholly impossible."
Sofia: Okay.
"Kingston: There's a chance it could happen, but I mean, you just, I guess the one thing I would want you to know is that like, the weight of asking for something like that. 'Cause you know my powers come from the city, you know? And so it would be me putting on New York to, if I were to do this, if it were on me it would be me asking New York to make this happen. And that would be something the city would decide. And you know, the truth is, if they said no it's no. But I don't know, that's just the way it will go. Is it possible? Maybe, but it's a huge ask. But I mean, if that's something you would be interested in. And fully, the one thing I ask is if you want, if this is going to go here that you really take into account what we're asking for 'cause it really is heavy. But I love you so if you want me to ask, I will."
Sofia: I don't think this is a decision I can make so...
Kingston: Of course.
"Sofia: Maybe I'll just, maybe I'll just talk to Dale."
Kingston: Yeah.
"Sofia: And maybe he can make the decision because it's, you know, yeah. [sobs softly] I appreciate your honesty."
"Kingston: Of course. And I hope you know that as busy as I am, I'm always here if you need me."
"Sofia: I know, it's just, [sniffles softly] you know, it's easier to be there for someone than to ask someone to be there for you."
Kingston: I understand.
"Sofia: Anyways, I mean, tell me about everything going on in your life."
[Lou and Brennan laugh]
"Sofia: Honestly, it'd be a favor for me if you talked about yourself right now for a little bit."
[Brennan laughs]
"Kingston: Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's weird we're both expecting parents now."
Sofia: I know.
"Kingston: I guess me and this dragon, I talked to Liz about it last night. She's pro-dragon, she's on board."
Sofia: Wow.
Kingston: So I guess we're gonna—
"Sofia: I mean, it's kind of fun to be expecting at the same time, right?"
"Kingston: I mean, right? Hey, we'll be able to exchange tips and I mean maybe—"
"Sofia: Yeah, babysit for each other. A dragon and an angel."
"Kingston: Oh, 100%."
"Sofia: I mean, that's adorable best friends."
"Kingston: I mean, best friends, [laughs] a match made in Heaven. Your angel child, my dragon child."
[group laughs]
"Brennan: As Sofia and Kingston laugh together about the bizarre unfoldings of The Unsleeping City,"
"Pete, you meet up at Neptune Diner in Astoria. Waiting for you in a booth is, you walk in and immediately see one of the most beautiful people you've ever seen in your life."
Ally: Great. [laughs]
"Brennan: She has vibrant multicolored hair, piercings, tight leather jacket over a hoodie, a couple pins. Yeah, loaded up with piercings and tats."
Pete: [enamoured] Hi.
[spacey new age music]
[Emily laughs]
"Pete: [deeper voice] Hey, hi, [laughs] sorry."
"Brennan: Beautiful, young Korean-American woman with again, patches all over. And you see that she has like a little flash card dropping off this thing. She has sort of like rubber halves of a keyboard tied into the sleeves of her thing. Like, she could unzip her sleeve and pull a keyboard out."
"Lou: [laughs] Oh, okay."
"Brennan: That's like made of something flexible that's like a cloth she can wear. She looks up and says,"
Maddie: Hi.
Pete: Hi.
Maddie: Hey.
Pete: Hi!
"Maddie: Hi, nice to meet you, I'm Maddie, hey."
"Ally: I go for a hug even if it's not, if she's sitting down, I'm standing up."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll a persuasion disadvantage for me.
[Emily laughs]
"Ally: God fucking damn it. Oh, Jesus Christ, hold on. Okay. That's, oh, not too bad. Persuasion I have pretty good, right? I don't have that pulled up right now."
"Brennan: Yes, but with disadvantage for sure."
"Ally: Oh, that's okay, okay. It's a 14. Does that mean I catch myself during it and go, “Oh! Sorry, maybe that's a little too forward.”"
Brennan: I'm gonna make something for her. She hits a nat five and a beat after you've started bailing on the hug she clocks the hug and goes for the hug herself.
"Pete: [laughs] Oh, ah, I..."
"Maddie: Oh, oh, oops. [laughs] Oh God, sorry, thanks for the dance."
[Lou laughs]
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Maddie: Yeah, hi, take a seat."
Pete: Totally.
Maddie: Thanks for meeting up in person. Let me—
"Pete: Oh, actually, you know what? I have to pee."
Ally: Can I go to the bathroom and just do like a breathing exercise and try to fucking calm the fuck down?
[Emily laughs]
"Pete: [to himself] This is just a person, this is just another person. This is two skeletons hanging out in a booth, Pete, all right?"
Brennan: All of Maddie's features that are not skeletal come back to you in a very real way in that moment.
Pete: [sighs] She's more than a skeleton. [laughs]
Brennan: [laughs] But you breathe.
Pete: She's so much more than a skeleton.
"Brennan: You breathe, walk back out."
Pete: Yo. [chuckles]
"Maddie: Hey, are you, we don't have to do this if you are, if this is weird for you. I just need to say in person again, I have so much guilt around what happened and I'm so sorry. Like, I can't… Yeah, I'm so… There's no—"
Pete: Yeah.
"Maddie: I wrote that email and my words are like failing me now, but I'm really sorry and yeah."
"Pete: It's okay. It was fucked up, for sure. But my parents are actually, the parents that you gave my info to were awful people. But since then they're a lot better. And I never wanna be like, oh, that traumatic thing, I never wanna like baptize a traumatic incident and be like, it was worth it 'cause this good thing happened. The trauma was still bad, but it is better now."
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"Maddie: Right, yeah. Bad things happen and they're bad and good things happen and they're good. And sometimes one leads to the other but it doesn't justify the other."
"Pete: You know, it's the work that I did. It's not the bad thing. Anyway, yeah, I go to therapy now."
"Brennan: She laughs and smiles a little bit. She's like,"
"Maddie: No, I get it."
"Brennan: Pete, you look and see on Maddie's jacket amongst a multiplicity of other things that she's got a trans pride flag on her jacket."
Ally: [smiles] Cool.
"Brennan: She goes,"
"Maddie: Yeah, I really get it. And I was in a super fucked up place. I did that job, figured out what was going on after I had already delivered and it's just unacceptable. It's just really unacceptable."
"Pete: Yeah, it's… I really appreciated your apology. It was really well- written and yeah. So you're a hacker."
"Maddie: Uh, yeah."
[players laugh]
"Maddie: Yeah, like to a degree, yeah. I do some black hat work."
"Pete: Sick, that's really fucking sick! That's so sick."
"Maddie: Oh, shit. Yeah, it's cool. I mean, like, it's a lot of hours of grueling computer programming that's like very..."
Pete: Totally.
"Maddie: Like, it's way less sexy in person than it sounds when someone calls you a hacker, which of course sounds very sexy but is not reflective of the truth—"
Pete: Totally.
"Maddie: —of like me, deep in an office chair for many hours at a time doing extremely tedious work so…"
[Pete laughs]
"Maddie: Are you into computer stuff as well? I mean, I know what you used to do."
"Pete: Yeah, no, yeah, I'm kind of turning over a new leaf, so to speak, so I just work. Right now I'm working at a bookstore and trying to deal with the pay decrease from being a, you know, [laughs] major plug to rich people."
"Maddie: Yeah, no, I hear that. Yeah, money is fucked. And the amount of reward you get for doing the wrong thing a lot of the times is really challenging to the soul so—"
"Pete: Yeah, that's crazy that you say that actually. So you did ask if there was anything else that you could help me with, and I'm wondering if you would just have any interest in, my friends and I are, honestly, we're trying to take down Gladiator."
Maddie: I'm in.
"Pete: They're kind of taking over the city. Yes, okay, well, I have some crazy info for you."
Ally: And I hand her a copy of the drive that I've just moved all of the most important stuff into.
Pete: Do you want to take a look at this and see—?
Brennan: She unzips her sleeves.
[Ally laughs]
"Brennan: Slaps this keyboard on the diner computer, sucks down half of a mint chocolate chip milkshake, and just. [mimics rapid typing on keyboard]"
Ally: Fucking dream girl. [chuckles]
"Brennan: It's tapped. You see the screen is reflected. She takes some glasses out and projects a little screen up in front of her on some next-level techno shit. She goes,"
"Maddie: Ooh, this is extremely fucked up and bad in a huge, major way."
Pete: Uh-huh.
"Maddie: Yeah, okay."
Ally: Can I see if she's magical at all?
"Brennan: Yeah, I was just gonna say, you detect that she is not magical, and the Umbral Arcana is kind of like..."
Ally: Huh.
"Brennan: But you see that she pulls up, I'm gonna, she's gonna make a little hacking check right now."
Lou: Hacking check.
"Brennan: She pulls something up and goes,"
"Maddie: Okay, interesting."
Pete: Hm.
Maddie: This is blocked off. This is top secret. I would need more time to get into this. Okay.
"Brennan: She says,"
"Maddie: It looks like Gladiator is about to make like a major acquisition in the city, but I'm not—"
"Pete: Whoa, of what?"
Maddie: I can't find out just yet. I should go back to my home machine which is a little bit more powerful.
Pete: Which area do you live in? I was actually gonna go into the city if you wanna...
"Brennan: She says,"
"Maddie: Oh, I live in LIC, I live in Long Island City."
"Brennan: Which Pete, you would know is just down the train from you in Astoria. You see she says—"
Ally: Cool.
Maddie: But I can head back to my home machine and look at this stuff. Do you know anyone named Joe Jacobs?
"Pete: Yeah, I maybe have come across him before. Why, what's up?"
"Maddie: He, this is wild. There's like… His, why would an internship application have gone off of a normal server? They're like—"
Pete: You can see that they've removed his internship application?
"Maddie: Yeah, there's just a weird thing—"
"Brennan: And you see she dives further into it and is like,"
"Maddie: Yeah, there's like something, there's an internship application for this guy named Joe Jacobs."
"Brennan: And you see that she says,"
"Maddie: Yeah, I'm just noticing like a bunch of stuff behind this firewall. I obviously can't open it, but it's very weird to see an internship application being hidden in a deep-security cybervault like behind a million levels of firewalls."
Pete: Whoa.
"Maddie: If you know this person, Joe Jacobs, you should go talk to him pretty soon."
"Ally: I send out a text to the group and be like,"
Pete: Can someone get in touch with JJ?
Ally: And then I kinda explain that.
"Brennan: Iga and Cody, you've just made the discoveries that you've made here."
Siobhan: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: When you get that message from Pete.
Siobhan: And that machine seems like something that's connected to JJ's research.
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
Siobhan: Great.
"Zac: Was I going to JJ at any, like I wasn't sure."
"Brennan: Yeah, you wanted to go hang with, I think you're on your way to the Gramercy Occult Society."
"Ally: Oh, great."
"Brennan: So you're actually, you're hanging with JJ who's working on some stuff at Gramercy when these texts start showing up on your phone."
"Zac: Okay. But we've kinda... generally know what they're talking about, like that it has to do with the magic."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, with New York Minutes, specifically."
"Zac: Yeah, okay. I'm with JJ. I'm slightly unclear on if there's actually new information other than that Gladiator knows."
Murph: There's also the stuff at the mall.
Zac: Yeah.
Siobhan: Yeah.
Murph: We would be texting you about that they've actively taken JJ's...
Brennan: Research.
"Zac: Right, gotcha."
Murph: Discovery and put it into a robot.
"Emily: I follow up and I say,"
Sofia: Maybe JJ would know how to destroy this prototype.
"Ally: Whoa, yeah."
"Brennan: If you guys send the prototype to Ricky, like the pictures you guys took. Ricky, do you want to show that to JJ?"
"Zac: I mean, yeah."
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Ricky: JJ, this is kinda what's going on over here."
"Brennan: His eyes go wide and he goes,"
"JJ: Um, you should get everybody here right now as fast as possible."
Ricky: Okay.
"Ricky: Hey, let's link up at the Gramercy Occult Society. JJ wants to talk to us."
"Brennan: Cody and Iga, you guys head in. Sofia and Kingston, you guys head in. Pete, Maddie looks at you and says,"
"Maddie: Hey, so I'm gonna head back to my home machine."
Pete: Super cool.
Maddie: And I'm gonna try to crack whatever Gladiators purchase was or what their acquisition was.
Pete: Super cool.
Maddie: I'm gonna hit you up with that as soon as I can.
"Pete: Yeah, let me put you in my phone. Let's see, Maddie, what's your number?"
[Zac laughs]
"Pete: Oh here, you can put in your number. Also, yeah, just put in like, I just have a weird way of filtering names so like, what's your sign 'cause I'm just gonna put that."
[Emily and Siobhan laugh]
"Pete: I'm just, I'm weird. I'm super crazy, but yeah, what's your sign though?"
"Brennan: She looks at you, raises an eyebrow and says,"
"Maddie: I think technically I'm an Ophiuchus, which is a 13th sign of the zodiac."
Pete: ...What?
"Maddie: I don't know, maybe look it up."
Brennan: And she types in “Maddie.”
Ally: Did someone just out-astrology me?
[group laughs]
"Brennan: Ally, you should go ahead and Google what an Ophiuchus is."
Emily: Does Ally even believe in astrology?
"Brennan: I might be mispronouncing it. But she leaves herself as Maddie Park and also fills in a contact with, you see she snaps a little selfie of herself to put a contact photo of her in your phone. She goes,"
"Maddie: Is it forward if I text myself so I have your number, too? I'm just gonna do it."
Brennan: And she texts herself.
Pete: You're the serpent-bearer.
Maddie: That's me.
Ally: [laughing] This is fucking nuts.
Brennan: The 13th zodiac sign?
"Emily: Okay, now I need to look this up."
"Ally: Okay, all right."
"Brennan: So she smiles, heads on the train. You head in to the city."
"Pete: Wow, cool. Fucking cool. So cool to meet someone cool. [chuckles]"
[Lou and Brennan laughs]
Zac: I like to think that Pete's mind has never been more blown than a 13th zodiac sign.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, I'm just like."
Brennan: Incredible.
Pete: But what's your rising?
Ally: I'm like two hours too late. I'm just on the train.
Pete: What's your moon?
"Brennan: Also, Pete should look up what time it is now versus when Ophiuchus is as a sign 'cause Maddie's birthday is coming up very soon."
Ally: Good fucking god.
"Brennan: But you guys all get to Gramercy. JJ comes out as you guys arrive at the Gramercy Occult Society. He looks at you and goes,"
"JJ: What you guys found at the Millennium Gladiator Campus is fucked. It's completely fucked. This is the opposite of my research. It's like the inverse of what a New York Minute is supposed to do. They're destroying them. So time and space are relative, right, and what that basically means is when time is going faster, space is going slower. But when you're moving faster through space you're moving slower through time, right? So there's sort of an inverse relationship there. If you compress time and slow it down to the point where it stops in a single moment, you have the potential to expand space infinitely in which every atom of creation is as far apart from every other atom as possible. Ultimate isolation. That is the physical definition of nothingness. Every single thing broken down to its finest atoms separated by endless void, completely alone. If you can flatten time, you can create nothingness."
The cast digests this.
[Ally exhales softly]
"JJ: But it looks like it broke, right? The machine didn't work? Okay."
Iga: [nods] It broke big time.
Sofia: Don't they have a different plant in Connecticut and a plant in New Jersey? I gotta wonder if there are other prototypes of this and if there's other versions of this technology.
"Iga: Yes, does this have to be in New York? Is there a New Jersey Minute or Connecticut Minute?"
"Brennan: He says,"
JJ: I think it would work the best here. Like if you were gonna try to destroy the universe it would—
Sofia: The Catacombs.
"Brennan: He looks and says,"
JJ: Something like that.
Brennan: He says—
Ricky: JJ.
JJ: Yeah.
"Ricky: Is there, so, at the fire station we had a Shop-Vac and it could really suck stuff up. But you could flip the switch and it could really blow stuff out. You usually don't use that so much with the Shop-Vac because you don't want stuff everywhere, but is there a way, since they reversed your thing, could you just reverse it somehow?"
"JJ: [eyes wide] Wait right here, wait right here."
"Brennan: He runs off into another room and you see he fiddles around for about like 10 minutes and you start to hear a laughing from the other room going,"
JJ: [laughs] Get in here! Get in here! Get in here!
[dramatic instrumental music]
Zac: I head off.
"Brennan: You guys rush in. In this laboratory of the Gramercy Occult Society you see that there is a poster of lunch atop a skyscraper, that photograph of the New York construction worker sitting on an I-beam over the city. JJ in black and white is in the photograph on the I-beam with the other dudes moving around waving at you and he goes like,"
"JJ: It fucking works, you can reverse it! Ricky, you can reverse it!"
Ricky: How is this reversing it? What is this?
"Brennan: He hits a watch on his arm, leaps out and goes,"
"JJ: So it's not science, it's magic science. It's magiscience, right? New York Minutes are connected to the past, but they're connected to the stories of the past, right? So the more powerfully something represents a true memory of the past, you can reverse what they're doing and not flatten time, you can expand it. And if there's something that's really attached to a moment in history and it has that fucking dragon magic—"
"Brennan: And he points at Iga's chest, he says,"
"JJ: You can go back into the past. Not the past past, but like a memory of the past."
"Brennan: And you see he goes and runs over and starts fiddling, doing magic with a bunch of watches and hands these watches out to all of you. He says,"
"JJ: I've been working on these for a little while. Okay, so this is like a New York, it's like a Gotham Timepiece, right? So it's a Gotham Timepiece and—"
"Cody: [quietly] Oh my god, this fucking rules."
[Brennan laughs]
"Cody: Holy shit, go on."
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
"JJ: If something is powerfully connected to the past, you can, it's a very limited form of time travel. We can only do it here because of all of the Umbral Arcana coming out of the Umbral Engine. So in a place with a lot of Umbral Arcana or raw Umbra in it you can flip the switch, use the timepiece to summon New York Minutes and can potentially move into the past, right."
"Ricky: Wait, so—"
Iga: Maybe we go to Ellis Island?
"Ricky: Those things we're looking for, the seven things."
Sofia: Are in the past.
"Kingston: All right, we go back."
Ricky: Are they specific things?
"Brennan: Iga, as you say Ellis Island, Maddie texts you, Pete, and says,"
Maddie: Looks like Gladiator just finalized a purchase of Ellis Island and the museum.
"Ally: I tell everyone and then I write back,"
"Pete: You didn't ask but I am an Aquarius and we're extremely compatible, just kidding."
Ally: And then like a lot of GIFs of people being embarrassed.
[group laughs]
"Cody: Dude, write “lol”. Write “lol”, Pete!"
Ally: And then I write another “lol” after all the GIFs.
"Ricky: Send a selfie, send a selfie."
"Sofia: Ooh, ooh!"
Ally: I send a selfie.
Emily: I get the lighting just right. (laughs)
Pete: Thank you.
Brennan: Incredible.
"Pete: Thanks guys, that was a great idea."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: I think as Maddie sends that, Maddie also sends something unrelated which was an article that never mentioned Gladiator but about a month or two ago, Gladiator bought some of the museum items from Ellis Island. Bought museum items from Ellis Island in a private exchange for a private museum they were building. Those items have not yet shown up. Gladiator hasn't released any plans to actually create a museum. Objects were bought from Ellis Island, but Maddie just sent this thing today about them going back and buying all of Ellis Island."
Ally: Is there a list of what the items were?
Emily: Or the number of items?
"Lou: Yes, any chance it was seven items?"
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Maddie hits you back,"
Maddie: Looks like seven artifacts were bought from the museum.
Lou: Let's go!
Ally: Okay.
"Murph: Vroom, vroom, vroom! Moped."
Brennan: You guys fucking boogie.
"Sofia: Can I get on the back of your moped, Cody?"
"Iga: Can I also get on the back of your moped, Cody?"
Cody: Yeah.
"Pete: Hey dude, can I get on the back of your moped?"
Ricky: Sprinting with Ox.
Sofia: I'm actually really mobile. I just want to be around someone.
"Ricky: Pete, hop on my back."
"Ally: Oh, hell yeah. I send that selfie."
[Emily laughs]
"Ally: We're not toxically masculine, I'm riding him!"
Brennan: I'm gonna need everyone here to go into D&D Beyond and add a Gotham Timepiece to your inventory.
Emily: Okay.
Lou: Okay.
"Zac: Gotham Timepiece. “The Gotham Timepiece allows the wearer to manipulate New York Minutes in the following ways. Number one, run on New York City standard time, reliably 10 minutes late, but never more than that to any appointment. Time travel into objects with a variable DC based on the objects' connection to the past only the presence of heavy Umbral Arcana. Accomplish more than one task during downtime by taking on a level of exhaustion. Once per short rest you may take an additional action on your turn, taking a level of exhaustion at the end of that turn.” And then last, “Features an Uptown Compass, Uptown, Downtown, East Side, West Side. Cannot become lost in the Five Boroughs even by magical means.”"
Lou: Hey.
Ally: Whoa.
Emily: Cool.
"Brennan: You guys arrive at Ellis Island. You've taken the ferry out. It's closed up, obviously it's in the process of being sold to a private corporation which is a dark day here in New York City."
Ally: Nightmare.
"Brennan: I actually think you guys, there's probably not a ferry going here so I think you guys arrive here— Sorry, there is a ferry waiting for Kingston as you guys get here."
"Lou: Yeah, don't mess around dude. What're you talking about?"
[Brennan slams fists]
"Lou: What, today's the day it stops working? Nah."
Siobhan: It's the same bus driver. She's qualified as a ferry driver.
Lou: Yeah.
[Brennan and Ally laugh]
"Brennan: You guys head off to Ellis Island. It's you, your familiars. As you arrive here, it feels eerie and desolate. There's no one here, it's been closed up. You approach and see a pair of doors shuttered with chains and locked up."
Cody: Permission to just freak out and break them?
[Brennan laughs]
Emily: Is there a window?
Brennan: Yes.
"Emily: Can I peek in and see if there's a dark spot in there, like a spot of shadows?"
"Brennan: Yes, there is."
"Emily: Okay, I can also teleport in there."
Lou: Do we want—
"Emily: But we all need to get in there, I guess for some reason I was like, oh, maybe I can open it from the inside. But maybe I could open it from the inside in which case you can walk under the chains."
"Siobhan: If we all get in the box, you can teleport us all in."
[Emily laughs]
"Murph: Oh, that's fun."
Ally: Incredible.
"Emily: That's great, everyone—"
Zac: Can I use Divine Sense?
"Lou: Yeah, can I make a Perception check through the window real quick?"
"Murph: Yeah, Cody just has his sword out walking towards it."
"Cody: Yeah, that's cool, teleport or just kick the door in, either way."
[Siobhan laughs]
"Brennan: You guys, yeah, it's all groovy. Your Divine Sense does not turn up anything."
"Zac: Okay, all right."
Ally: Whoa.
Zac: Cool.
"Emily: I mean, I can also do recon and then come back out and then grab you guys and come back in 'cause I'm like, I mean, I'll Pass Without Trace all of us. Like, stealth is my thing."
"Murph: Could we like, fucking, go back in time to like when they were buying the things?"
"Emily: Yeah, but we kinda need to know the objects, though. Didn't it say that we can use it—"
Murph: Right.
Zac: Yeah.
"Emily: To go back in time with the object? So if the objects are in there, we can use our Gothic timepieces to re-remember these objects."
Murph: Cool.
"Zac: But is the Statue of Liberty an object, too? I don't know."
Siobhan: I would think so.
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: Yeah. So I think the issue is you guys need—
Ally: A candle?
"Emily: Candle, torch."
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys—"
Emily: A scrap of paper.
Siobhan: Could be the...
Brennan: So are you guys busting the door down or are you guys getting in the box and teleporting in there?
"Emily: I mean, whatever—"
Ally: [shrugs] I'm voting box.
Siobhan: I’m Team Box.
"Zac: The box and the teleporting sounds cool, yeah."
Murph: Cool.
"Emily: Okay, yeah, I mean, yeah."
"Brennan: Yeah, Sofia, you see there's a little wooden box there on the ground."
Emily: [chuckles] I will cast Pass Without Trace on all of us before they get into the box.
"Ally: I think I take a photo of the chained up door and send it to Maddie just like,"
"Pete: Oh, came and looked at it. Shit's pretty fucked up, can you believe this?"
"Brennan: You get a text back being like,"
Maddie: Are you physically at the shuttered Ellis Island? How did you get there?
"Pete: Yeah, I had to see it for myself. I just took a ferry, I'm with some friends."
"Brennan: You see there's ellipsis, ellipsis, ellipsis and then there's a text that says,"
Maddie: Trying to think of a sweet way to say sober Pete seems equally as crazy.
Ally: [laughs] I just send that swirl emoji and that dumb smiley face that's like. [tries to make their eyes point in different directions]
[Emily and Brennan laugh]
"Brennan: You, Sofia, you move through shadow, appear in quiet Ellis Island. The click of your Louboutins on the stone floor. Click, click, click, click, click. You walk through a number of halls here. There's a lot of wings to the museum, a lot of exhibits. You arrive in a room that is like a Great Hall and you see there's a small display in the center of the room with a number of empty cases. Looks like the cases here are empty, but there's a lot of photos and art up on the wall. And I'm gonna ask everybody here to go to Roll20. And you see all of those signs. You see that this appears to be, like everything in Ellis Island, there's a lot of immigration stuff, people moving to New York City. You see there's an exhibit titled, From New Amsterdam to New York, Life in the New World. There's another one titled Famine and Diaspora, Immigration and the Armed Services. There's one that says, Tenement and Family Life. There's one that says, The Great Migration and Harlem Renaissance. And you see there's another one that says 20th Century Immigration. You see these sort of empty cases. Everybody here go ahead and give me an Investigation check and tell me what you're looking for here."
"Zac: I would like, I got a 22 on Investigation."
"Brennan: Cool, cool."
"Zac: I'm wondering, just because it's the first thing that I feel like I connect with in my own brain was like, is there like, are people playing music in the Harlem picture?"
"Emily: Yeah, I had that thought."
Brennan: So each exhibit has tons and tons of pictures on it. Did anyone else crack a 20?
Emily: I got a nat one so just don't even talk to me.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I rolled a, I got a five."
Murph: I got a four.
"Brennan: Ricky, you look over—"
Lou: 19.
"Brennan: At those empty cases. You see the tags on them. The largest one says, Peter Stuyvesant's Leg. And then there's another one. There's some more of these empty cases around. There's at least one at every one of these kiosks, something that's been emptied, and looks like it's been empty for a while. You're guessing these are the things that Gladiator destroyed, Ricky—"
Zac: Oh.
Emily: Then let's read those captions.
"Brennan: Ricky, you see by the Peter Stuyvesant's Leg one."
Ricky: [quietly] Peter!
"Brennan: You see a little sign for kids that says, “Do you want to play hide and seek? You can find most of these objects from the photographs and pictures of the times they were taken.” And you look around and see one of the cases by the Harlem Renaissance one where you were looking says, a 1920s wedding bouquet. And there's a little thing being like, “Look, see if you can find it in the photographs.” I'm gonna need everybody here to roll initiative."
Siobhan: Shit.
Murph: Ooh.
Ally: What?
[Emily whistles]
Lou: Ooh.
Emily: Okay.
"Siobhan: Fuck. God, I'm rolling so badly today."
"Emily: 17, I'm rolling really poorly, too."
"Murph: Yeah, me too, I need new dice."
Emily: I pulled multiple nat ones. 17 though.
Brennan: Sofia got 17. What did Iga get?
Emily: Six.
Brennan: What did Cody get?
Murph: 10.
Brennan: What did Pete get?
Ally: 17 as well.
Brennan: What did Ricky get?
Zac: 12.
Brennan: What did Kingston get?
Lou: The big one one.
"Brennan: Okay. All of your Gotham Timepieces start to beep. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
[dramatic instrumental music]
"Brennan: It's detecting a tremendous influx of New York Minutes. That only happens when raw Umbra gets pushed through. You all feel the nature of this place has changed just through it passing into Gladiator's ownership. You hear a whisper, emptier and more hollow than anything you have ever heard repeat the words to itself mindlessly."
"Null: [inhales raspily] What, if anything, stays?"
Brennan: I'm going to need everybody here to give me an Intelligence saving throw.
Zac: Is anyone within 10 feet of— If you're within 10 feet—
"Emily: I mean, yeah, we're all near each other."
"Brennan: Sofia, did you actually move to that spot?"
"Emily: No, I just was in here."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: Yeah, I was assuming that we're all hanging out."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Yeah, I was kind of hoping a similar thing."
"Emily: That's gonna be, do I get the buff from you guys?"
Emily: Plus four.
Lou: What's the buff?
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, plus four."
Zac: Plus four on all saving throws.
"Murph: God damn it, I got a one."
Siobhan: So I got 16.
Emily: Gonna be a 12 for me.
(Murph sighs)
Zac: I'm gonna re-roll 'cause of luck.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph shakes his head in dismay.
Zac: [shaking his head] I got a 13.
"Brennan: Okay, did anybody here get an 18 or higher?"
Siobhan: [shakes her head] We're dumb.
Ally: I'm gonna re-roll with Tides of Chaos.
Brennan: Okay.
"Ally: Yes, okay, hell yeah."
"Siobhan: Yeah, maybe I'll use a luck point."
Ally: 21.
"Brennan: Iga, this is the same day that you blasted through all your luck points at JJ's machine over in Queens."
"Siobhan: Oh, didn't I just use one?"
"Brennan: Oh, did you? I think you may have used two, I'm not sure. But I think this might be your last one. I could be wrong, I trust you to remember, but I feel like you used more than one."
"Siobhan: Okay, then this is my last one. Okay, I make it, I get a 21."
Ally: Aye.
"Brennan: Cool, no one else got an 18 or higher?"
Emily: [shakes her head no] Mm-mm.
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: Pete and Iga.
"Ally: Oh wait, okay, so who's close? Because I can use Bend Luck on someone."
"Emily: I wouldn't be able to, I only got 12."
Zac: An 18?
Murph: I got a 1.
"Ally: Yeah, what did you get, Zac?"
"Zac: I got a 13, it’s not, I'm not close."
Ally: [groans] Okay.
"Brennan: Okay. Sofia, Ricky, Kingston, and Cody who did not pass their saves."
Murph grimaces.
"Emily: No, I did not."
"Brennan: 14, 16, 20. You each take 25 points of psychic damage."
Lou: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: You each take 25 points of psychic damage. Iga and Pete do not take either as Null appears in the middle of the room.
Null’s icon pops onto the map.
[Lou groans]
"Siobhan: “Either,” so that was supposed to be two things?"
"Pete: You guys, that's Null."
"Brennan: You see a colorless silhouette two-dimensionally blotting out the color from behind it. Oh, I'm gonna need saves for Misiek, Luna, Ox, and Cody's moped as well."
Zac: Fuck. Ox.
Emily: Cody's moped. [laughs]
"Lou: Come on, Cody's moped."
Murph: My moped!
Siobhan: Come on.
Lou: Come on—
"Emily: I rode that thing here, I suddenly—"
"Siobhan: Oh, Misiek."
Murph: Moped rolled a natural 19.
"Lou: Yeah, moped. (laughs)"
Emily: But does your moped have plus two to intelligence? It might.
Murph: It's got—
Zac: Fuck!
"Murph: No, it has minus four."
Zac: Same.
Murph: But it gets plus four being near me.
"Siobhan: No, but you get plus four."
Murph: So my moped does pass.
Brennan: Incredible.
"Emily: Oh wait, 'cause it's 18."
Siobhan: Misiek does not pass. Misiek is out of the battle.
"Zac: Ox is down, too."
Murph: No.
Brennan: Misiek is gone?
Ally: 13.
"Zac: Ox rolled a 13, but has negative four and that doesn't, you know."
"Murph: Yeah, what was the DC, 18, did you say?"
"Siobhan: 18, yeah."
Brennan: 18.
"Murph: Okay, yeah."
Emily: That's so funny.
Brennan: Luna is toast.
Ally: Luna's gone.
Murph: Penalty to the moped.
Emily: The moped passes.
[Siobhan laughs]
"Brennan: In this wave of psychic energy, [snaps as he lists names] Luna, Ox, Misiek, gone. As the barest tip of the claw of this monstrosity from beyond dreaming pushes its way through a wave of Umbral Arcana, through a wave of raw Umbra into the waking world, Ricky, Sofia, Kingston, and Cody, in addition to the damage you take I will also need a choice. You may either, you have a choice. This is either going to stun you or I'm going to need you to choose one of your six ability scores."
[cast is silent]
Lou: And you're not gonna tell us what happens to it.
Brennan: You can either protect yourself by succumbing to the stunned condition or you can resist becoming stunned by naming one of your six ability scores.
Murph: Take my...
[Zac sighs]
Murph: Dex!
[Lou and Siobhan laugh]
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: I think I'm gonna say my dex as well. It hurts Ricky so much to... lower his physical prowess, but..."
"Brennan: Cool. Cody and Ricky, you lose your inner sense of initiative, of reflex, deep emptiness fills you. Your armor classes are reduced to one. You no longer have the desire to get out of the way of incoming attacks, you are too empty. And you may not make ability checks that involve dexterity. No stealth, no sleight of hand, no anything like that. You will also auto-fail dexterity saving throws."
"Zac: Shoulda used another luck point, fuck."
[players laugh]
Brennan: Sofia and Kingston.
[Lou laughs]
"Kingston: Sofia, you got an idea?"
"Emily: I, uh..."
Lou: I choose strength.
"Brennan: Kingston, you lose your strength. You feel your age bearing down on you."
Lou: Aw.
Brennan: You will auto-fail strength saving throws. You lose access to the athletics skill. You do not have the physical bravery within you right now to grapple or launch a melee attack of any kind. Sofia.
"Emily: Do I get the sense that allowing myself to succumb to this is like letting it overtake me? Like, is getting stunned a sacrifice in itself or is getting stunned being complicit?"
"Brennan: Neither is being complicit. It basically has to do with whether your response is to throw your guard up in which case you're stunned or to flee and move, leaving yourself vulnerable for the nature of this thing to hit you in a big way."
"Emily: Okay, I mean, if it's breaking down to that I feel really bad being the only one to say this, but I think Sofia's reaction would be to throw her guard up."
"Brennan: Cool, you go stunned. You are in the stunned condition and will lose your turn, but can make a save against the stunned condition at the end of your next turn."
Emily: Okay.
"Zac: Oh, that sounds like a better choice. [laughs]"
[Brennan and Emily laugh]
"Emily: I felt like I was like, scared that I was like, wait, am I missing the message of this?"
"Brennan: No, no, no, no, not at all. Pete, that is going to be you."
"Ally: Okay, can I do an insight check to see if there's anything it, like, I can tell Ricky and Cody look extra bad, right?"
"Brennan: Ricky and Cody look bad. Kingston doesn't look great, either. And Sofia looks okay but is visibly stunned, in the stunned condition."
Ally: Okay. Can I do a roll to see if there's anything I can do to help Ricky and Cody or if they're in a lot of trouble right now?
Brennan: I don't need you to make a roll. All of you are in a lot of trouble right now. And this is Null. Null bought this today. Gladiator bought this today. This is a horrifying entity.
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: But also, if you guys run away, this is it. This is the lost artifacts of the dragon's hoard."
Zac: We have to get the stuff back right now.
Lou: This is it.
Ally: So can I use the timepiece and just start looking for these artifacts?
"Brennan: You absolutely can, Pete. You can take a move action to get, tell me which one, if any—"
"Ally: Gotcha, yeah."
"Brennan: —if there's a particular one you're running towards, and you're gonna need to give me a history check to try and recognize something. You're like, running towards it trying to look for the history as best you can."
"Ally: Okay, um..."
"Brennan: You can go more into the center of the room. If you go to the center of the room and give me a DC, like, I can give you information about the different ones, but you gotta run into the center of the room to do it."
"Ally: Can I do something like this where I like, go behind a thing like this."
"Brennan: Yes, you can, absolutely."
"Ally: Okay, I would like to do that and then—"
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Let me give you that roll. This is a, what is this, investigation?"
Brennan: Perception.
Ally: Perception.
Brennan: So you can give me a perception first.
"Ally: Great. Perception, that's only gonna be an eight."
"Brennan: All right so this next roll's not gonna be with advantage. This is your history check to try and use your Gotham Timepiece to find one of the things you're looking for. We're gonna need a DC, cool, didn't happen."
"Ally: Doesn't matter, it's a four."
Brennan: You—
"Ally: Uh, okay."
"Brennan: Cool, you've moved, you still have an action. You didn't find anything here. You could try to move, and the history checks are for free. You don't spot anything in that one. You can try to move down the line or move to another one or you still have an action left."
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: You've used how much movement now?
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: You've used like 30?
"Ally: 30, that was 30, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool, yep. If you want to use a dash action, you can."
"Ally: Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to do that."
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Okay, so we're gonna dash ♪ A little bit longer now ♪ Okay."
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Can I go here and do another history? That's not super far, but..."
"Brennan: Yes, and I'm gonna say because this is your second check this one's gonna be with disadvantage. You're just trying to hit a DC 15, go ahead and roll it."
Ally: History?
Brennan: Yep.
"Ally: Man. No, 6."
"Brennan: Pete, you run. At the end of your turn..."
"Ally: Can I yell while I'm hiding and tell everyone,"
Pete: This is Null. It's Null!
Ally: And then also...
Iga: Got it.
Pete: I fucking love you guys!
[Emily laughs]
Pete: You mean the world to me! I'm so happy that we're the Dream Team.
"Ally: And then yeah, I'm hiding behind this pillar."
"Brennan: Okay, I'm gonna need saves from Ricky, Sofia, Iga, Kingston, and Cody again. These are Intelligence saving throws, DC 18."
"Zac: Can I make a, is it a spell?"
Brennan: It is not a spell.
Zac: Okay.
[Siobhan groans]
Zac: What was the DC?
Brennan: DC is 18.
Siobhan: Nat 20!
Emily: It's intelligence so I don't automatically fail.
[Zac groans painfully]
Emily: I fail again.
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Ooh, I almost—"
Ally: How close to failing are you?
Emily: I literally rolled the same exact thing so I'm at 12 again.
Murph: I got a 16. That would be helpful for me.
"Ally: Yeah, I got you."
Murph: Thank you.
"Ally: Wait, what was the DC?"
Murph: 18.
Emily: 18.
Ally: Oh yeah.
Zac: I got it. [sighs]
Ally: All right.
"Zac: No, I got a, that's a, I did my math wrong, I failed. I'm gonna use another luck point."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Even worse, never mind."
"Ally: Okay, so this is for Cody."
"Murph: So bad, oh god."
"Ally: All right, Cody. Four!"
Murph: Yes! (claps hands)
Brennan: Hell yes.
Emily: Yeah!
"Ally: Four, four, four."
"Murph: Okay, so does my moped also have to roll?"
Brennan: Moped also has to roll.
Murph: You're the smartest fucking moped I've ever met. Come on. (gasps)
"Lou: Pete, how many times can you Bend Luck?"
"Ally: A lot, do you need it, what do you need?"
Lou: I'm also at 16.
"Ally: Okay, I got you. I will use sorcery points."
"Brennan: Can you do, no, I think Bend Luck is a reaction. I don't think you can use Bend Luck again."
"Lou: [voice muffled, pen in his mouth] It's all good."
Brennan: I think it's just a reaction.
"Ally: Wait. Oh, oh, I can't use it like on two different people by burning that number of sorcery points?"
Brennan: I think it's a reaction. Let me double check on your sheet.
"Ally: Yeah, it's definitely a reaction."
"Brennan: Yeah, so it's only once."
"Ally: Nuts, man."
Brennan: Just the once.
Lou: It's all good.
"Murph: My moped tried its damn best. It is a scholarly moped, but it only got a 16."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: It's a miracle that it survived the first round.
Murph: Honestly it's a...
"Ally: [whistles dejectedly] Fuck, Kingston, sorry."
Lou: To me it felt like—
Murph: Moped's actually super fucking smart.
Lou: Cody needed it.
"Brennan: 16, 24. Moped is gone."
Murph: No!
"Zac: God, we haven't had any, I haven't had a turn yet."
"Brennan: Yep. Who failed? Ricky, Kingston, Sofia?"
"Murph: Oh wait, I didn't."
Emily: I did.
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: Sofia failed again.
Brennan: Each of you takes 29 points of psychic damage.
Murph: Good God.
"Brennan: Same choice to make. I will say, Sofia..."
Emily: I'm already stunned.
"Brennan: Yeah, and I'm gonna just double check here."
Emily: Can I just keep being stunned?
Brennan: You're probably in the same position to just go stunned again.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Kingston and Ricky, what is the choice you are making?"
[Lou laughs]
Zac: I'm going to say I'm gonna... I feel like we just need to not be stunned and so I'm gonna say wisdom.
"Ally: Nice, dude."
"Brennan: Ricky, everything goes gray. You do not lose your memories, but you lose your ability to perceive, to gain insight. You have no understanding left of other people. You maintain a focus of specific memories. You know what you're supposed to do next. You don't remember any of your relationships to people. You've become like just a, you're like some kind of single-purpose, like a rescue dog running through the night, completely single track."
Zac: Very different from how Ricky used to be. [laughs]
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: Oh.
Brennan: Kingston.
"Lou: Yep, yeah."
"Brennan: And you still take the damage, by the way, but you ignore the stunned condition."
"Ally: Can I start a really small popcorn chant where I go,"
Pete: Dream?
Iga: Team.
Sofia: Popcorn? Oh.
[players laughing]
"Ally: We just start kind of chanting, like,"
Pete: Dream.
Ricky: What?
Pete: Team.
Iga: Team.
Pete: Dream. Team.
"Emily: I can only speak falteringly, so I kind of mumble along,"
Sofia: Team.
Lou: I will take Charisma.
"Brennan: Kingston, you lose your sense of self. You lose your desire or ability to interact with others. You don't have an ego that you can project anymore. You are able to perceive others. You are able to remember, but you no longer have a sense of who Kingston Brown is to make an impression on the world around you. Auto fail Charisma saves, may not make Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation checks."
[Zac sighs deeply]
"Brennan: That is going to be, so Pete, that was your turn. Null took its legendary actions. Sofia, at the end of your turn you may make another intelligence saving throw to come out of the stunned condition."
Emily: Okay.
(dramatic instrumental music)
"Brennan: Remember, you get the bonus from Ricky being nearby."
"Emily: Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: You do not come out of the stunned condition. Iga, on your nat 20 saving throw."
Siobhan: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: You feel yourself, the chest in your bag throbs with energy. This thing's ability on a nat 20 saving throw will not work on you again. Your magic was made to fight things like this as you stare into the emptiness. Ricky, that's gonna be your turn."
"Zac: Oh, fuck. Okay, I'm next to the one. I saw a bouquet on the thing that I am at right now, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, you did."
Ricky: Bouquet! [laughs]
Zac: That's how single-mind.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: And I'm hitting the watch—
Brennan: The Gotham.
Zac: Trying to go back in fucking time.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead. I'm gonna say you have advantage 'cause you hit a 22 on your perception. You're trying to clear just a DC 15 history check."
Zac: Come on. History?
Brennan: Yep.
"Zac: I got an 11, I have a zero to history."
[Brennan sighs]
"Zac: I'm, [sighs] I'm gonna use my last luck point."
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
Zac: 17.
Brennan: Hell yes.
Ally: Yeah!
"Brennan: Ricky, you rush up stumbling."
Lou: Good news!
"Brennan: Ricky, you cannot see anymore. Your body is falling apart as you go hollow inside. You hit the watch on your wrist. (mimics magical reverberations) Scintillating light, pure time. (imitates big band music) Pure New York hustle throws you into a photograph on the wall. Ricky disappears into a photograph. You no longer feel Null's presence. You have still given up those two ability scores. You still have a sense of self, but your wisdom is gone."
Zac: Do I still have a turn or is that my turn?
Brennan: You will still have an action now. You appear in the photograph on the wall.
Siobhan: Whoa!
Lou: Oh.
"Murph: Oh, shit."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: Look at that, yeah, Ricky's in the photo."
"Zac: Oh, whoa!"
Lou: Amazing.
"Brennan: Incredible, it's so incredible. You hear jazz playing."
(peaceful jazz music)
Brennan: You hear laughter and music.
(guests laughing)
Brennan: A band is playing and you hear a bunch of people gasp—
(crowd gasps)
Brennan: As you appear. You are again—
Zac: Naked like Terminator?
Siobhan: [laughs] Just covered in goo.
Ally: So ripped and so naked.
"Brennan: Ricky, you are standing in your modern garb in a wedding in a beautiful venue right off of 125th Street in the 1920s. You see a bunch of people gasp. What do you say as you look out? You see there's some piano players. You can see here in the photograph the people here in this family. The cake has just been cut and people look to behold you as you appear here."
"Ricky: Okay, everyone."
[Brennan laughs]
"Zac: [laughs] I'm struggling to maintain. So I don't feel the effects, but I still, like, I'm still—"
"Brennan: You still have lost your Dexterity and your Wisdom, but you still have your Charisma, so Persuasion."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: You still have a sense of self. What you have a hard time, if you think about it, you've lost access to Insight and Perception."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: So you don't know what's going on with these people. It's more like you're confused, but you can still talk. You still have that part of you."
"Zac: I'm going to use, like, I don't have an actual spell for this, but my Civic Authority that I've used in the past to just let everyone know,"
"Ricky: Everything's calm. Everything's fine, this is—"
Emily: Everything's—
"Ricky: Everything's calm, so pretty to be here."
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: You see a man walks up to you. The groom actually walks up to you and says,"
"Groom: Sir, can I help you?"
"Ricky: Listen, you are a man who's been married today and it feels like it must be good for you to feel that way. And so for the day to be continued to be blessed, I would love to borrow a bouquet of flowers."
Brennan: He looks at you.
Zac: I'm smiling in the nicest smile I can smile.
"Brennan: Amazing. He says,"
Groom: Just any bouquet will do?
Ricky: I think it's a specific bouquet.
"Zac: But can I make any sort of check to, can I Locate Object or is that? God, I don't know if I want to burn that."
"Brennan: Yes, you can cast."
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: On your turn you cast Locate Object. It is the bride's bouquet.
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: You need the bride's bouquet.
"Ally: Of course it is, of course."
Emily: Wow.
"Murph: That's a tough sell, that's a tough sell."
Ally: Yeah!
"Ricky: I'm pretty sure this is not going to be the happy thing you want to hear, but I need to borrow the bride's bouquet. It is a matter of saving New York."
"Brennan: Ricky, you look over and see next to you on the table even through your confusion, a guestbook for the wedding of Arthur and Marian Brown. We're gonna cut from Zac, it's someone else's turn. You cast Locate Object. You know what it is you do. Kingston, that is your turn."
Lou: So I have no sense that I am Kingston Brown. I'm just a vessel on a mission?
Brennan: You are a vessel on a mission.
"Lou: Okay. Then driven by my mission… Okay, let's do this. I'm gonna cast Enhance Abilities at a one, two, three, at a fourth level."
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: And touch Cody and Iga.
Brennan: Okay.
"Murph: Cool, thank you."
"Lou: And look at them and just say,"
Kingston: [flatly] This will help us do what we came to do.
"Lou: And then myself as well, and then I will slowly walk over to “From New Amsterdam to New York”."
"Brennan: “From New Amsterdam to New York”, yep, cool. You cast that. Go ahead and give me a history check."
"Lou: Great. Okay, that's gonna be a 17."
"Brennan: Oh, baby, Kingston."
Siobhan rubs her hands.
Brennan: Here is what you see.
"Lou: [laughs] I made it off the board, thank you God. Oh, okay, great."
"Siobhan: Oh, all right. Maypole time."
"Brennan: Kingston, you are standing in brand-new New York. Peter Stuyvesant has surrendered to the British a couple weeks ago. You are standing around this maypole dance. You see a woman holding a wooden leg."
"Lou: Great, I cannot make any sort of check with regard to persuasion so I'm just gonna ready myself to cast Command on my next turn and force her to give me that leg."
[Murph and Siobhan chuckle]
"Brennan: Incredible, Siobhan."
Siobhan: Yes.
Brennan: Is it okay if I throw a curveball at you?
"Siobhan: Oh my goodness, I would be honored."
"Brennan: Siobhan, you are dancing around a maypole having a great time. You've played a practical joke on that fucking stooge, Peter Stuyvesant."
Holly: Tra-la-la.
[Ally laughs]
"Brennan: And a man appears. Kingston, you are like rendered in the wood etching style of this drawing here. [to Siobhan] You see a man approaching, preparing to cast a spell. [to Lou] And Kingston, you feel as if you remember this person."
"Lou: I mean, I guess there's the idea that I, like, I don't know. This new Kingston is intense so it's like I remember them but I know I'm not connected to the part that knows them."
Brennan: It's like you're full dissociated.
Lou: Yeah.
Brennan: You're not experiencing your own life anymore. You're just a series of actions. But you do know that this person looks up at you with recognition.
Kingston: I need the leg.
"Holly: [pauses] I'm sorry, hello. What?"
"Kingston: Hello, I need the leg."
"Holly: I mean, I'll give it to you. I think it's very funny to give this leg that I stole to a stranger. What, who are you, what's going on?"
Kingston: I'm called Kingston Brown.
"Brennan: You see someone in the distance calls out and goes like,"
"Someone: Oh right, that's, over there in the corner. She stole Peter Stuyvesant's wooden leg! That's Miss Holly Branch!"
[Zac laughs]
"Brennan: This is Misty, this is 1700s Misty Moore."
[Emily laughs]
Lou: AKA Holly Branch.
"Brennan: Holly Branch. Siobhan, what does Holly do in this moment as this strange man asks for Peter Stuyvesant's wooden leg?"
"Siobhan: I think what I do is… Because I am somewhat of an agent of chaos, I give him the leg and I say,"
"Holly: Nay, 'twas this man, he took the leg!"
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Incredible, you smile and laugh. Kingston, you are holding the wooden leg. The townsfolk begin to laugh and cheer. Cody “Night Angel” Walsh, that is your turn."
"Murph: Sweet. Cody is not dexterous right now, does not have a moped."
"Siobhan: If you hold, I can move us."
Ally: Ooh.
"Murph: That would be very cool. Sweet, can I use my action now but wait to use my movement on Iga's turn, Brennan?"
"Brennan: Sorry, can you hold your action?"
"Murph: Yeah, I want to cast Bless on a bunch of us to give us d4s."
"Emily: Oh, I could use that especially 'cause all my paladins are gone."
"Brennan: Yeah, I would probably..."
"Zac: Oh, gosh, sorry."
"Brennan: Yeah, man, do what you're gonna do."
"Murph: Sweet, I will go ahead and with the fires of Hell, bless my friends. It's within 30 feet. If I can see Kingston in the picture would that count? Could I give Kingston a d4, too?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I'll let you give Kingston a d4."
Murph: I think the only person—
"Brennan: You are just out of Counterspell range, my man."
"Murph: Let me see if I'm close enough to get Pete. I think unfortunately there's no possible way I can get to Ricky. Okay, I think I'll move forward a little bit. Iga, were you going to like Thunder Step us or like move us?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
Murph: Okay. So I could still use my movement and you can Thunder Step.
Siobhan: Yes.
"Murph: Just so I can make sure I get Pete, too. So I will use my movement—"
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: —to run forward, so I'll go kind of get in the middle so I can hit everyone. I'll go 25 feet, get in the middle. [a little menacingly] And then I will summon the powers of hell [normal voice] to bless everybody."
(Ally and Emily laughing)
"Murph: At a third level I can hit everybody except for Ricky, unfortunately."
Zac nods.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Is that a d4?
Murph: Yes.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You hear Bazathrax in your chest go,"
"Bazathrax: Hell yeah, dude, let's do it! What the fuck's going on out there anyway?"
"Cody: You haven't fucking talked to me for like, what are you doing in there, dude? You've just been in there."
"Bazathrax: Dude, we gotta fucking crazy L section on here and a monster bong, dude."
"Cody: Who's, oh, right, The Jersey Devil's in there. I was just mindlessly consuming devils. Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!"
"Bazathrax: This fucking dude is a monster, dude!"
"Brennan: All right, incredible, you cast Bless."
"Murph: Oh, and then can I do, I guess can I do a History check on the one that Pete failed on?"
"Brennan: Yes, there's also, you're right next to, those middle plinths are also—"
"Murph: Oh, okay."
Siobhan: 20th Century—
Brennan: Yeah.
"Murph: Yeah, I'll just do whatever one I was closest to."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it. Go ahead and give me an Intelligence check."
Murph: Great.
Lou: Advantaged.
"Murph: Oh yeah, ooh, baby."
"Brennan: Ooh, yeah, his—"
"Murph: Okay, yeah, with advantage. 21."
Brennan: 21?
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, baby."
"Murph: Oh, even more 'cause now I have proficiency in History. Yeah, like 23."
Brennan: Dope as hell.
Siobhan: Maybe I'll Thunder Step Sofia.
Brennan: Watch what happens now.
"Emily: I am kind of worthless, so you should Thunder Step someone who can actually do something."
"Siobhan: Well, everybody's—"
Emily: I have plus two to intelligence.
Siobhan: You're the only person in my range.
"Emily: Okay, I'm probably just gonna stay stunned this entire time. (laughs)"
"Brennan: Cody, you appear in the 20th Century Immigration, 1970s. [mimics magical reverberations]"
[players laugh]
Brennan: Incredible.
Siobhan: The sword is still too big.
"Brennan: Amazing, truly amazing."
"Ally: Oh my god, oh my god. Absolutely unreal, the screenshot of a lifetime."
"Brennan: You're standing in a family home. You see there is a happy, beautiful family, two Chinese immigrant parents and their first-gen kids. You see there's a little kid with a Mets cap holding a baseball."
Siobhan: Oh!
"Brennan: The kids, the people here look at you and you see the dad says,"
Dad: Who the hell are you?
"Brennan: And the kid looks at you and says like,"
"Kid: Hey Dad, who's this guy?"
"Brennan: Cody, what do you— You've used your action so you get to say something, but you're out of actions for this turn."
"Cody: Uh hey, my name's Cody, uh..."
[Zac laughs]
"Brennan: Iga, that is going to be you."
"Siobhan: [sighs] Okay, so its magic won't work against me. Do I get the impression that my magic will work against it?"
"Brennan: You get the impression that your magic will work against it, yes."
"Siobhan: Okay, in which case what I want to actually do, instead of doing Thunder Step, is this a humanoid?"
"Brennan: No, this is not a humanoid."
Siobhan: Damn. Damn!
Lou: [quietly] Damn.
"Siobhan: Um, hmm. Then I would like to see if I can cast Suggestion on Null."
"Brennan: Cool, awesome, go for it."
Siobhan: And I would like to suggest that it leave this place. It's a DC 17 Wisdom check.
"Brennan: Iga, you attempt to abjure this thing. The magic of this dragon sorcery hits this dream being."
[discordant chime resounds]
Brennan: And you feel it is completely immune to charm effects.
[Siobhan sighs]
"Brennan: It,"
Null: [inhales sharply] You would attempt to sway me? I cannot be swayed.
Brennan: Any movement from Iga on her turn?
"Siobhan: Yes, I'll move towards these suitcases up here."
"Brennan: Those ones up, yeah."
Siobhan: Am I close enough here to be able to see the photograph?
"Brennan: Sorry, that series of photographs actually does not have one of the cases by it, the one by the suitcases. You can go for one of the other ones, but you'll be rolling with disadvantage."
"Siobhan: Well, I have advantage from Kingston so I would just be rolling flat."
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: Sofia, do you have advantage in darkness on checks or anything like that?"
"Emily: I have, no. I can see in total darkness. I have the Devil's Sight but—"
Siobhan: Right.
Emily: But no.
"Siobhan: Okay, well, I'll roll on “Tenements and Family Life”."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it. Just a straight roll."
"Siobhan: Oh, I make it. I rolled a 17, plus Bless, plus two."
Brennan: Cool. [mimics magic energy shooting]
[festive instrumental music]
Brennan: You see an image appear before you of a sort of 1800s tenement family seamstress like tailors celebrating Hanukkah together. Go ahead and make a Perception check for me.
Siobhan: 18.
"Brennan: A shape smiles in through the window made of brick back through the window behind you, silhouetted in the sky. You've used your action. Now Null is going to go."
"[softer, spookier music plays]"
Brennan: On a natural 19.
"Lou: Oh, I don't like this one bit. I like nothing about this."
Brennan: Null joins Iga in the photograph.
[players protest]
"Lou: What, come on, dude!"
Brennan: Chasing the person with the nat 20 on the save that has the Dragon Chest.
[menacing Box of Doom music plays]
"Brennan: I'm gonna roll in front of the board to see if Null recharges its Mind Blast. On a 5 or 6 on a d6 it recharges. 2, it does not recharge."
"Ally: Okay, yes, yes!"
"Lou: Oh, God damn. [laughs]"
"Brennan: Gonna roll some attacks. Both of those hit Iga. Iga, you take one, two, three. Sorry, hold on, I gotta just count these dice up real quick."
"Murph: Oh, Jesus."
"Brennan: 8, 7 is 15, 20, 23. You take 29 psychic damage."
Murph takes off his glasses.
"Brennan: Seven, nine. Nine, 15, 17. And then 23 psychic damage."
"Lou: [chuckles] What? What are you at, Iga?"
Siobhan: 44.
"Murph: You guys have so much HP, it's crazy."
Brennan: I'm gonna need Iga to make two Charisma saving throws.
Siobhan: Okay.
Murph: You are Blessed.
Siobhan: I'm Blessed.
Emily: Charisma's gotta be good for a warlock.
Siobhan: And saving throws I have a plus nine to Charisma so.
Ally: Amazing.
"Siobhan: Mm, still not great. 14 on the first one. [sighs] 13 on the next one."
Ally: With Bless?
"Siobhan: With Bless, yeah. I rolled really badly."
Brennan: Your hit point max drops by that same amount of damage.
Siobhan: So now my max is 44?
Emily: Oh.
"Brennan: Yes, your max is 44 as you feel Null [inhales raspily] trying to hollow out your soul. That is now going to be, Pete, that's you."
Lou: Huh.
"Ally: Okay. I am. [inhales and exhales] Okay, I'm going to use sorcery points to cast Haste on myself as a bonus action."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Ally: And then I'm going to roll for this, like a history check for the one in front of me."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: We got that watch, remember, that is good with directions."
"Ally: Yeah, that's a 16 plus, what's..."
"Brennan: I'm gonna say this, Pete, too. Because you already failed that one, you might want to move farther along to move to one of the other ones that you didn't fail on if that makes sense. Like, rather than go—"
Ally: Does the DC get harder?
Brennan: The DC gets harder when you've already failed on them.
"Ally: Oh, I got you. Let's see, it's a history check, right?"
"Brennan: Correct, yes."
Ally: So do you think a 17 wouldn't work on this one?
"Brennan: I don't think a 17 would work on this one, but it would work on the next one down."
"Ally: That's great. Okay, so I'm gonna move here."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: And I'm actually doing it on this one.
"Brennan: Dope as hell. Pete, you appear in a massive crowd of people disembarking from a ship. You see that there is a family of Irish immigrants coming off of a steam ship and a huge crowd of people. It's like 1847. You see that a bunch of them look up at you. And you've used a bonus action to cast Haste so you still have your action left. You see that there is a woman who turns to look at you and looks at you with a look of recognition."
Pete: Hi.
"Brennan: Go ahead and with your remaining action, go ahead and roll Persuasion for me if you'd be so kind."
"Ally: Okay, yeah, hell yeah, 19."
Brennan: Ooh.
Ally: 20.
"Brennan: You see a man, a woman, and a little kid walk up to you. The woman walks up and says,"
"Woman: Young lad, are you, do we know you?"
"Pete: Yes, and I need your help."
"Brennan: Instead of having to look for this, Pete, you look at this woman who looks at you, meets your eyes and looks at you and says,"
"Woman: You're the one. You're the one that the folk under the hills told us would come. “A child would be born in this new world to the daughter of your daughter's son,” said they. “Charmed and cursed alike shall he be, fair of face and quick of tongue, a shapeshifter and friend of the wind. He will walk between all ways, and his name will be known to him before it is known to any other. He will be a voice to the unspoken and in a city without sleep he will awaken."""
"Brennan: The little boy reaches into a pocket, takes out a gold Faerie coin and places it into your hand and it becomes a penny in your hand."
Pete: Thank you. You guys don't know what you've done.
Ally: And then I get the fuck out of the painting.
"Brennan: [laughs] At the end of Pete's turn, Null's gonna take a legendary—"
"Ally: Oh honey, that's not the end of my turn. I cast Haste on myself, that's one action. I'm moving on to the next one."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it. You can either give me a DC 20 History check to dip straight into another photo or you can dip back out into the common room."
Ally: Can I dip out back into the room and move up to another photo?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
"Ally: Okay, yeah, I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna dip back out and then move to this next photo."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: “Immigration and the Armed Services.”
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Boom, you got your coin. Go ahead and make your history check."
"Ally: Okay. Hell yeah! Okay, that is a 16."
"Brennan: 16, cool. Pete, you're looking at this wall looking for photos everywhere. As you are looking for photos you know you have the coin, Kingston has the leg, Ricky's working on getting the bouquet. Is there a particular thing that you're looking for? Does Pete remember the other items that you guys were looking for?"
"Ally: Yeah, I'm either looking for a scrap of paper or a candle or a cymbal."
Emily: I think the candle would be with Iga.
"Siobhan: Yeah, it's Hanukkah."
"Ally: Probably, cool. So it's gotta be scrap of paper or candle, [shakes head] or I mean, or cymbal."
"Brennan: Pete, you see..."
"Siobhan: Oh, brass band."
"Emily: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, armed services."
Ally: Nice!
Brennan: You see a ticker tape parade with paper.
Ally: Amazing.
Siobhan: Oh.
"Emily: Oh, scrap of paper."
"Brennan: It is a ticker tape parade. You fly in. You see a young husband and wife. The husband has just come back from fighting the German Army, fighting the Nazis in World War II. They both look at you. You see that they are a young couple of immigrants. They are two young Colombian immigrants. The young man in his 20s looks up at you and goes,"
Alejandro: Peter?
Pete: [eyes wide] Oh.
"Alejandro: Peter, is that you?"
Pete: Alejandro!
Brennan: His eye flashes golden and you see peeking out of his messenger bag is a book of spells for him fighting a bunch of occult Nazis during World War II.
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: As a wizard. He looks at you and says,"
"Alejandro: Peter, how do I know you? What is it that you need, my friend?"
Pete: I need a piece of paper.
"Brennan: He reaches up, grabs a piece of paper, puts it in Pete's hand. What a fucking turn from Pete, baby."
"Ally: Uh, we're not done. I'm gonna use the timepiece and get one more turn."
[Murph gasps]
Brennan: And get a level of exhaustion?
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it, dude."
"Ally: Okay, honey, we're popping back outta here. I'm like,"
"Pete: Thank you for your service, Alejandro."
Ally: And then I pop back out. [laughs] And I go do the next one.
Zac: Nice.
Brennan: Amazing.
"Ally: So if that's bonus action was casting Haste which gave me two turns then I'm doing this, this will, yeah, a third turn."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and give me another History check, homie."
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: And are you going in to one of other occupied—
Ally: Yes!
Brennan: What was that?
"Ally: I rolled a 17 so it's an 18 History check. And cutie, you know I'm looking for that cymbal."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Pete, you rush out, boom, appear here. Sorry, wait a minute, the DC for this went up. This is now a DC 20 so you do not get—"
Lou: Bless.
Murph: Did you use Bless? Did you use Bless?
"Ally: Oh, I have Bless. I have Bless."
Brennan: Gotta hit a two on that d4.
Ally: Stupid.
Murph: Come on.
Ally: I'll roll it in front of the board.
Brennan: Go for it.
Murph: Just not a one.
Lou: Here we go.
(Siobhan groans nervously)
(dramatic instrumental music)
Lou: Two!
Ally: Yes!
[players cheer excitedly]
"Siobhan: Bare minimum, we love to see it."
Murph: Fuck yeah.
"Brennan: Pete, using his dream sorcerer shit to tear through these other realms."
"Siobhan: Damn, can I just say, Kendra fucking killed it on this one."
Brennan: Isn't this beautiful? Aren't these photos—
Siobhan: They’ve been doing a great job this whole time.
"Ally: Oh yeah, incredible."
Siobhan: But these pictures are so good.
"Ally: Absolutely incredible, they're so sick."
"Brennan: Pete, you appear in a photo from, like, turn of the century, like 1900."
[Ally laughs]
[cheerful organ music]
"Brennan: You see there's like a family, a well-to-do family and there is a father and daughter that look like this is around a huge wave of Italian immigration coming into the city. And you see there's a man playing an organ grinder. He's got a capuchin monkey with the two little cymbals doing the thing. Looks up in the middle of his performance, smiling. He goes,"
"Man: [Italian accent] Oh, buongiorno, hello! You appear from nowhere."
"Ally: Do I know this person, can I do an Insight check? Or is this a full stranger?"
Brennan: Give me an Insight check.
Siobhan: “You know the monkey.”
[players chuckle]
Lou: That's who you know.
Siobhan: The monkey is Marcel from Friends.
Ally: That's only an 8.
Brennan: You have no idea who the fuck this dude is. This is gonna be some serious Persuasion stuff.
Ally: I'm gonna try to intimidate him.
"Brennan: Okay, go ahead and give me an Intimidate check."
Pete: Give me that fucking cymbal.
[Ally and Lou laugh]
"Ally: Oh baby, that's a 27."
[Siobhan laughs]
Ally covers their face.
"Brennan: Pete, you like, the photograph roils and you see the guy goes,"
"Man: Okay, okay, it is all right. Listen, you can have the, here."
"Brennan: You see that he claps his hand. The money jumps to his shoulder. He takes one of the cymbals, looks over at you. You look behind him, see his sweet little daughter and also see a bicycle behind him."
Ally: Cool.
Siobhan: Oh no! [laughs]
"Ally: What? Wait, what? Um.."
Emily: They're related to me. They're related to me.
(Brennan clapping)
"Ally: I take the cymbal, I have no idea who these people are, and I say,"
Pete: Thank you for your service!
Ally: And I get out.
[cast members laugh]
"Brennan: And Pete is fucking gone. Okay, that's Pete's turn."
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: Okay, at the end of Pete's turn Null is going to attack Iga with a legendary action. That's a hit. Iga, you take 12, 14—"
"Siobhan: Killing me, man, killing me."
"Brennan: 18, 25 points of damage. Give me a Charisma saving throw."
"Siobhan: God damn, I'm rolling so badly. It's a 15."
Brennan: Your hit point max is reduced by that amount.
Siobhan: God. So now my hit point max is 19.
Brennan: Yes. That's gonna be Sofia.
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna try to get out of being stunned. That's gonna be, do I get to add Ricky's—? I think it doesn't even matter if I do. Even if I added Ricky's stuff I'm just still stunned."
Brennan: Oh no. I'm so sorry.
Emily: [laughs] You know what?
Brennan: Yeah.
Emily: I have been doing great ever since I found out I was pregnant.
[cast laughs]
"Brennan: Yeah, you remain stunned."
Emily: Will you let me have used the timepiece even though I'm stunned to get an extra chance to try to break out of this?
"Brennan: If you want to take the level of exhaustion, I'll give you another save right now."
"Emily: Okay, oh, but then it will still just be the end of my turn."
Brennan: You know what?
Emily: So I couldn't—
"Brennan: If you're gonna use that power, I'll do beginning of your turn. Go for beginning of your turn."
Emily: Okay. Fuck me!
Murph: Oh my god.
Ally: No!
Emily: Two plus nine is 11 plus two is 13 plus four.
"Brennan: (sighs) Stunned is really, really rough."
"Emily: You know, I just thought someone should try it."
Lou: Amen.
"Brennan: I hear you. Ricky, that is gonna be your turn."
"Zac: I think Ricky's in this painting, confused. He's gonna look at the… There's two ways to do this in Ricky's mind."
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: He's noticed that he's still very strong and maybe can just grab it and just do something that way.
"Brennan: Mm-hmm, yeah."
Zac: Or is the little girl Kingston's mom?
"Brennan: No, this is the 1920s so these are Winston's parents. Winston has not yet been born."
Zac: Gotcha.
Brennan: Winston has not yet been born.
"Zac: Oh, okay. In that case, Ricky's just gonna go,"
Ricky: I'm the leprechaun of good luck!
"Zac: And rip his shirt off and say,"
Ricky: The Brown family will prosper forever!
[Lou laughs]
Zac: And grab the bouquet and run away.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an opposed Athletics check.
Murph: Oh my god.
Brennan: As you grab Kingston's grandma's bouquet.
"Lou: Oh, Ricky, we're gonna have words about this."
Zac: Opposed Athletics check?
Brennan: Athletics.
"Zac: God, I hope this works."
Brennan: She got a 17.
"Zac: [hides his face] I rolled a 3, I add 9 to that. I got a 12 and it's just an Athletics?"
Murph: Good God.
"Brennan: Ricky, you go to grab the bouquet."
[players gasp]
"Brennan: The freshly-married Marian Brown pops you right in the eye and says,"
"Marian: Get your hands off my bouquet, this is my wedding!"
"Zac: I hit the watch again, we're doing it again."
Murph: Oh my god.
Zac: We're doing it again.
Ricky: I'm sorry. This is good luck! this is good luck!
Brennan: She got a 6 this time.
Murph: Me and Ricky are thrust into these insanely awkward situations.
Zac: Rolled a 19.
"Brennan: Ricky, you see the pianist runs up, the guy who's playing the piano runs up, grabs you and helps you get the bouquet. You pull it out. You see this dude, you see his drummer, he's the band leader on the piano and on the drum it says Sebastian Sinclair. And you see he looks at you and goes,"
"Sebastian: Take care of her for me, Ricky."
Brennan: And is referring to his great-granddaughter.
"Zac: Oh, Esther's... Wait."
"Brennan: This is Esther's great-grandpa. Not related to the Brown family, but playing the piano at their wedding."
Ricky: I will!
Zac: And I jump out of the picture.
"Brennan: Ricky, you grab the bouquet, you are outta here."
"Zac: Okay, can I move to Sofia and try to give... gosh. [sighs]"
"Emily: I'm a lost cause. He's just gonna keep doing it and I'll keep failing it, anyways, you should invest—"
Zac: Okay.
Emily: I also have plus one to History so I can't even help with history checks or anything.
"Brennan: Ricky, you can at least jump out and give your bonus to Sofia on the saving throw."
"Zac: Okay, I'll jump out and then I wonder if I have any fucking thing I can spell-wise do. I don't really have anything, I don't think. I guess I'll cast Sanctuary on, I don't think that matters, right? They're like AoE kind of things, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah."
"Zac: Never mind. Yeah, that's the end of my turn."
Brennan: At the end of Ricky's turn this is the final attack. This possibly will do enough damage to drop Iga. Null hits Iga—
Zac: Oh! Can I go through the paintings like Pete did?
"Emily: Oh, to go into Iga's."
"Brennan: Yeah, if you want to try to jump to Iga's painting you absolutely can."
"Zac: Wait, I don't even, I can't, yeah, I can do that, I'll do that."
"Brennan: Okay, you gotta hit a DC 20 History check to jump from painting to painting."
"Zac: What is that, a nat 20? Let me see."
Ally: What do you have to History?
Zac: Zero.
[Murph sighs]
Ally: Okay.
Zac: No.
Ally: Aw.
Murph: Shoot.
"Brennan: But Ricky, you—"
Siobhan: The level will know that that is.
Brennan: You can still exit the painting.
"Zac: Okay, I'm just gonna come back over here and be within 10 feet, [sighs] yeah."
Brennan: Null hits Iga on a three or higher.
Siobhan: God damn.
Brennan: I'm gonna roll in front of the board.
[dramatic instrumental music]
Emily: Do you have Shield or anything?
Siobhan: Nothing.
[Murph groans]
"Siobhan: I have counterspells, is it casting spells? It's just hitting me, right?"
"Brennan: It's not casting a spell, just hitting you."
"Siobhan: I'm down, I mean."
"Brennan: Ricky, as you leap back out into the room, you look and see the photograph up on the other side and see Iga in that photograph (snaps fingers) vanish from the photograph."
Emily: Doesn't she get a Charisma save to make it not be reducing hit point maximum?
"Brennan: Oh, that's true. That is true, so go ahead and roll in front of the board. Iga, to succeed on this saving throw you need a 12 or higher in front of the board."
[dramatic instrumental music]
Ally: Hey.
Brennan: 16.
Lou: Oh god.
Emily: Ooh!
"Lou: Holy shit, that—"
Emily: Yes!
"Lou: If her hit point maximum was reduced to zero, full dead?"
Emily: Then she would be dead.
Brennan: Full dead.
"Lou: Fuck this game, dude, holy shit."
Brennan: Let me tell guys right now—
Siobhan: I'm so sweaty.
"Brennan: Very happy, very happy to celebrate that moment. You guys are not out of the woods, and Iga is really not out of the woods. We're gonna move right along in initiative. That was Null's last legendary action. Kingston, that is your turn."
"Lou: All right, fuck this. Can I jump, so I have the leg."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Emily: Jump to Iga.
"Lou: Yeah, yeah, I look down at Misty and I'm like,"
"Kingston: [flatly] This was kind of you. You have done good, I must go."
"Holly: I hope to meet you again, you're very handsome."
Kingston: You are very kind to say that. I'm gonna go.
"Lou: And I'm going to, yeah, let me jump to “Tenements and Family Life.”"
"Brennan: Go ahead, I'm gonna need a DC 20 History check."
"Lou: Okay. First one won't do it. [exhales softly] God, I hate this so much. Second one will 100% do it on a 19 plus 6, 25."
"Brennan: Kingston, you flash across the room face to face with this entity. As you do so, it turns to regard you. Kingston, you move, you still have your action."
"Lou: Great, Revivify on—"
Brennan: On—?
"Lou: Or no, you're not full dead, right, you're just at zero?"
Siobhan: I'm not full dead.
Lou: Just at zero.
Brennan: Oh yeah.
"Lou: Okay, great."
Siobhan: And don't use a higher level spell on me 'cause my hit point max is 19.
"Lou: Great. Can I just, oh, I have no strength. I can't pick Iga up, okay."
"Siobhan: If I get out of it, there's stuff I can do."
"Brennan: Kingston, you see Null's presence is freezing this family in shape. As you appear, the family turns to you and outside you see Willy look and say,"
Willy: Kingston Brown.
"Brennan: You see the young girl reach down, grab a candle off the table and hand it to you as you appear in the photograph."
"Lou: I silently take it, put it in my pocket, look at Willy and nod. And I'm gonna cast like a, yeah, I'll cast a first-level Cure Wounds on Iga."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Lou: 'Cause it won't do much. That's gonna be nine, Iga."
"Siobhan: Great, thank you."
[choir chanting majestically]
"Lou: Okay, you're back up. I'm then gonna, can I, is it another action to jump photos again?"
"Brennan: It is another action, yeah. You can leave for free with movement."
"Lou: Okay, if I use the Gotham Timepiece can I jump to another photo and use another, or I've already used one spell, no more spells this turn? Could I jump to another photo and use an action?"
"Brennan: Honestly, if you're gonna use the Gotham Timepiece, yes, you can do that."
"Lou: Okay, great. Then I would like to jump to the Great Migration and the Harlem Renaissance."
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: DC 20 still?
Brennan: DC 20.
"Lou: Okay, that'll do it. That's 19 plus one equals exactly 20. I look at my family. I don't feel like I'm Kingston Brown so I do nothing. I'm gonna hop out of the photo, run over to Sofia and throw detergent of… the Holy Grail Detergent on her."
Brennan: Kingston—
Emily: What's that mean?
"Brennan: Before you exit the photo you feel a hand on your back. Your charisma and strength return to you as your grandfather Arthur Brown looks at you and says,"
"Arthur: Young man, that's a nice coat."
Brennan: And regards the coat that he will buy three years from this day.
"Lou: I smile real wide, say,"
Kingston: It does a lot of good.
Lou: And hop on out.
"Brennan: You hop out of the photo and hit Sofia. Sofia, you are out of stunned condition."
"Sofia: Oh, you didn't have to do that, Kingston. I think I don't have much to add to this battle, anyways."
"Kingston: Hey, we're a long way from being out of the woods."
Sofia: Okay.
"Kingston: So no soldiers, you know, not working right now."
Sofia: Okay.
Kingston: Snap to it.
Sofia: All right.
"Brennan: Incredible, Kingston is-"
"Kingston: Also, I saw Misty. At the time I didn't really realize what was happening. I saw Misty, she stole the leg! God, I miss her."
"Sofia: She would, classic Misty."
"Kingston: She would, she would. Honestly, when this is over I'm gonna jump right back in that painting."
(players laughing)
"Brennan: Sofia is free. Kingston, you have jumped out. Ricky has the bouquet. Kingston has the leg and the candle, Pete has the cymbal, the coin, scrap of the ticker tape, but I will say now, Pete and Kingston and Sofia all have one level of exhaustion. Disadvantage on ability checks."
Lou: Yep.
"Brennan: Cody, it is your turn."
"Murph: Oh boy, so Murph knows that this is Jackson, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Cody's got no idea who the fuck this is."
"Murph: So Cody has no, I can't even do a check, right? Like, Cody has no fucking clue."
"Brennan: You can do a check, it's just a high DC check."
Emily: You've hung out with Sofia.
"Murph: Yeah, I know, but he's a little kid."
"Emily: Yeah, I know, I know."
Murph: What kind of check is it?
Brennan: Persuasion.
"Murph: Oh, persuasion. (laughs) Just me bumbling and saying, ""I'm Cody""? I got a 19, oh wait, I have bless, 21."
[Siobhan laughs]
Brennan: 21?
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: What does Cody say to this kid looking at him? You see a young Jackson Wei with his first Mets cap holding a baseball looks up and you and goes,"
Jackson: Who the heck are you?
"Cody: Um, I love sports and I'm a huge baseball fan. Throw one right down the middle, champ. [holds his hand out]"
[Lou claps]
[Emily laughs]
Murph: And Cody has fully never played any sport in his life.
"Ally: Oh, for sure."
Murph: And like goes like he's catching a football.
"Brennan: You see Jackson looks, smiles, winds up, pitches. Baseball, bam, hits you, you grab it and blast out of the photo."
Murph: Phew.
"Brennan: Iga, starting your turn within 30 feet of Null, there is an Annihilating Aura."
Siobhan: No.
"Murph: Do I still have an action, Brennan, 'cause I..."
"Brennan: You still have an action, yeah."
Emily: You haven't used your timepiece yet.
"Murph: I still got the ball. Can I— I guess, can I try to jump paintings and get to Iga's?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and give me a History check."
Murph: Okay.
Zac: So funny that Cody has one of the best History scores of—
Emily: I know.
Siobhan: Yes.
Ally: Yeah.
Siobhan: He did the work.
"Murph: Oh, for a day. Oh my God, I did so good."
[players laugh]
"Murph: I got a, Jesus Christ, I got a 27."
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Cody, you leap into the painting with Iga."
Siobhan: Der Nachtengel!
"Murph: And then I guess I'll just, oh boy, what can I even do here? I can't really heal you, right?"
Emily: You could push her out of the aura.
"Murph: Yeah, can I just get, can I just like-"
"Brennan: There's no pushing— The extra-dimensional space here doesn't work like that. There's not enough space to push her out of. Besides, even the idea of shoving someone 30 feet in a row would be a lot of Athletics checks."
Emily: Maybe just grab her out.
Murph: I will cast Warding Bond on Iga.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: Ooh, yeah!"
Brennan: On your tarot—
"Lou: Wait, the thing from the—"
Emily: I knew!
Lou: From the cards!
Emily: Yes!
"Murph: Yes, it's from the tarot!"
Siobhan: (laughs) Okay.
Brennan: From the tarot.
Lou: From the tarot cards!
Murph: Oh my God.
"Brennan: You cast Warding Bond. Iga, you are going to make the saving throw of your life."
"Siobhan: Oh, God."
(epic instrumental music)
Brennan: At the beginning of your next turn. And the beginning of your next turn is gonna come next week on the next episode of The Unsleeping City.
(Zac sighs)
(Lou cheers)
"Brennan: Tune in and join us then, gang. We'll see you later."

"[Aldous Young's ""New York 2006”]"
"Brennan: Hello, one and all! Welcome to another thrilling episode of ""The Unsleeping City."" I'm your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Last we left off, our champions had just returned from the Monastery of the Sacred Rat. They met with the spirit Kugrash who told them all about different ways to bring back the Dragon of Bleecker Street to defeat Null. We had a meeting with Pete's new friend, Maddie Park, a hacker who was able to show them a bunch of crazy stuff that Gladiator was doing buying Ellis Island. JJ invented the Gotham Timepiece that allows you to time travel through objects that have a strong, magical, emotional connection to the past. Our friends wound up on Ellis Island, which was the location of the missing seven artifacts of the dragon's hoard, the last thing they needed to bring the dragon back as long as they can reunite these artifacts with the dragon's long lost horde. All seven objects were collected. However, Null has pushed through into the waking world. This property has been bought by Gladiator Industries. In a surge of raw umbra, Null has pushed through and is now here in the waking world. We left off mid combat. It is about to be Iga Lisowski's turn. How many hit points does Iga have left, Siobhan?"
Siobhan: Nine.
"Brennan: Nine hit points left. There is a Warding Bond. We return to combat, Cody has jumped into these lithograph, the sort of old daguerreotype photo. Cody has leapt in there with you. Cast warding bond. At the beginning of your turn, Iga, I am going to need a Wisdom saving throw. The DC is 21. You have Bless."
Siobhan: I have Bless. I have a plus two to wisdom.
Murph: And you have a plus four from me.
Siobhan: And I have a plus four.
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: Let's go ahead and roll this in front of the board. Let's go ahead and roll it in front of the board, Iga."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: This also, I will say, this is its Annihilating Aura because you're starting your turn in its presence. You get a plus six to this roll. Let's roll the d4 of Bless first, so we know what you have to hit on the d20."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: Four, okay."
Emily: Oh. So you’ve got a plus ten to this.
Brennan: You have plus 10 to this roll. You need an 11 or higher on the d20. Go ahead and roll.
Lou: Can I ask what happens? I don't know what Annihilating Aura is. What happens if this doesn't go well?
Brennan: A lot of damage and a potential for it to lower Iga's HP max.
Ally: From 19?
Lou: Whoo!
Brennan: 16!
Emily and Zac: Yeah!
"Siobhan: All right, okay."
"Brennan: You succeed on that. You do not take any of that damage. Iga, it is your turn."
Ally: (chuckles) A crowded-ass picture.
Siobhan: I would like to… The candle has already been taken?
"Brennan: Yes, that's correct."
Siobhan: But do I get the impression that if Null destroys this picture everybody in the picture will be destroyed?
"Brennan: Null will likely erase every one of these photographs. If it is allowed to remain here, it will do what it did to Willy. It will do what it has been doing all over the city and consume this place."
"Siobhan: Okay. I will cast, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna start off by doing… (sighs) I'm gonna start off by doing an Eldritch Blast to it."
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: Do I have Bless to attack rolls?
"Brennan: Yes, you do add Bless to attack rolls."
"Siobhan: Okay. So plus nine, that's a… A 28. And a 26."
Brennan: You hit three times.
"Siobhan: Great. So that's, I'll roll in front of the board 'cause I can't do math right now."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: So that's 37 damage to it.
"Brennan: Iga, you stand up and (mimics explosions) Null is shredded with the force of this ancient dragon magic. Is not gone. Remember you're fighting, like, a tentacle of a kraken that is still out in the ocean. But this hurt."
Siobhan: So I'm gonna use my Metamagic Adept sorcery points to do Quicken Spell.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: And I'm gonna blast it again.
Brennan: Go for it.
Siobhan: That's three more hits.
Lou swings his arms side to side in a celebratory dance.
"Brennan: Ooh, Doctor! Let's go!"
Siobhan: It'll just be plus 15 'cause I already used my bludgeoning damage. That's 37 damage.
Lou: Whoa.
: 28?
Brennan: Damn.
Siobhan: I'm gonna use the watch.
Brennan: Yeah!
Lou: Let’s go.
Siobhan: And I'm gonna go again. How fucked up is it looking?
"Brennan: Not that fucked up, but these are powerful hits. It can't take an infinite amount of these."
"Siobhan: Okay. Ooh! Okay, I crit. And I also rolled a nat one, but the other one also hit. So I hit, I crit, wait, does Bless, if you add Bless to a 19, it doesn't make it a crit. Okay. So it's still 3d10 plus 10, okay. Math."
Lou: [exaggerated] Math.
Siobhan: That's 28 damage to it.
Brennan: Iga has done a phenomenal amount of damage to this being.
Zac: Can you get out of there?
"Siobhan: It's gonna wipe this photograph. It's gonna wipe Willy, right?"
Zac: It seems like it's gonna wipe these photographs anyway.
"Emily: Yeah, I think we need to get, I think we do need to get him gone."
Siobhan: We need to get him gone.
"Murph: We can kill him, but you should also back up 'cause you dying doesn't help."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Ally: Your hit points are so low. We don't want you to get full dead.
Emily: You could jump out of the picture.
"Siobhan: I'll jump out of the picture then. Yeah, I guess I'll also… Since I have it, I'll activate my Elemental Gift, so I can fly."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: And I'll get out of the picture.
(magical whirring sound)
Brennan: Iga jumps out of the picture. You've moved a full 30 feet. Null goes next in the initiative.
(Lou groans)
"Brennan: Seeing the candle taken out of the picture, Null ceases its attack and moves back into the room, walking slowly behind Iga."
(Lou laughs)
Siobhan: [whispered] Fuck.
Ally: Making some sort of horrible clicking noise or something like out of a horror movie.
Brennan measures something on the roll20 board.
Lou: No! Stop using your ruler. Stop.
"Brennan: We're gonna roll a recharge. Five or six, Null recharges it's mind blast."
"Lou: Fuck this dude. (Null gets a 4; Lou yells and claps) Oh. There we go, kids. There we go."
"Brennan: It is now going to use, it's going to make two enervating strikes against Iga who is in range. Again, these hit on threes or higher. Rolling in front of the board. That's a nat 20."
Siobhan: Oh fuck.
Lou drops his head out of the camera’s view. Siobhan takes her glasses off and rubs her temples.
Brennan: Okay. We'll roll the non nat 20 first. That is going to be...
"Siobhan: 19 is my max, so if it does 30 damage I’m dead, dead."
"Brennan: Okay, actually no. I'll be fairer and I'll roll the crit first. That is going to be 10d8 plus six."
Lou: What?
Brennan: That's double damage. Rolling in front of the board.
"Ally: Wait! Wait, what did you hit with? Is there a way for me to Bend Luck on those attack rolls?"
"Brennan: A nat 20 would be a nat 20. This thing hits Iga on a three. Like, you know, like even-"
Ally: Of course.
"Brennan: And the nat 20 wouldn't cancel the crit. It would just adjust the final total. Iga, you take 42 points of damage."
Zac: Warding Bond?
"Murph: Warding Bond goes, that just means she dies. And also I get hurt. (sighs)"
"Ally: Wait, Warding Bond doesn't keep her from dying? I thought it means you take all the damage that she would be taking?"
Murph: She gets resistance. This spell words is “willing creature you touch-”
Siobhan: So I would take 21 damage. So I'd be down but not dead.
"Murph: Because of, yes, great. Oh. you’re right."
"Brennan: You are down, but not dead."
Murph: Great.
"Brennan: It hits you again, which I think is also had, which is probably just going to be two death saving throw failures. I'm gonna roll this. If it deals your hit point max, I think you're fully dead, which is 19, right?"
Siobhan: Yes.
Brennan: 'Cause you're at zero. [rolls] 35 divided in half—
Siobhan: So it's 17.
Brennan: 17\. It doesn't hit your hit point max. It's two death save failures.
Murph: Oh my God.
Ally: Nooooo.
"Brennan: We're not out of the woods yet. This is very bad. Okay. Iga is not fully dead, but now you have to make two saving throws. Two DC 21 saving throws. Because you're out of the photo, you no longer get Cody's plus four bonus, but you are proficient in these Charisma saving throws. You have a plus nine. Go ahead and roll that d4 twice first."
Murph: I have to roll for concentration on Bless 'cause I've taken a bunch of damage.
"Brennan: Oh yes, yes, yes. Go ahead and roll damage."
"Siobhan: Yeah, roll your concentration."
Murph: What did I take each time?
Brennan: First time you took 21. The next time you took 17.
Murph: So 10 and 10?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Murph: Okay. First one is a… I pass, 13."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Second one. I pass, 14."
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: Oh, I can't take this."
"Brennan: So, three on the first one and then a one on the second one for your Bless. So, what you need to hit right now is basically a DC 18 and then a DC 20. You have-"
Siobhan: I have a plus nine.
Brennan: So you need a nine or higher and then an 11 or higher. Let's roll these. First one is you get a nine or higher. ….16.
"Siobhan: Yeah, baby!"
Lou groans in relief.
Brennan: Roll again. 11 or higher on this one. ….12!
Murph cheers.
"Emily: Yeah, baby!"
Lou: This is a nightmare.
Zac: Oh my God.
"Lou: Oh, I don’t like this."
"Brennan: Iga still has two death saving throws and this creature has legendary actions. I know I keep saying it, we are not out of the woods yet. That is Null-"
Emily: I don't think anyone was acting like we were out of the woods.
"Lou: Yeah, which one of us is dancing, Brennan? Which one of us is cheering?"
"Emily: Yeah, which one of us just said “we’re out of the woods now!”"
"Ally: I mean, I was shouting ""we're out of the woods."""
"Zac: ""I can not believe we're out of the woods,"" I said."
"Siobhan: ""Oh my goodness. It's so nice here in the sunshine."""
Ally: “I can’t even see the woods anymore!”
"Emily: ""Thank goodness. Pack up the tent 'cause we're not in the woods anymore."""
"Brennan: [sassily] Okay, okay, okay, okay."
(Ally screams)
"Brennan: Sofia, that is your turn."
"Emily: No, it's Pete's turn."
"Brennan: Oh, sorry. Pete, that is your turn."
"Emily: Sofia, doesn't do anything. (laughs) It's Pete's turn."
"Ally: I am going to, I had a med bracelet in the earlier season, but I actually switched to testosterone gel. So, I just take out a little packet of testosterone. I take out the gel. I rub it on the back of my neck."
"Pete: Ooh, baby. I forgot about that this morning."
Ally: And I cast a sixth level Dispel Magic on Iga.
Zac: On Iga?
Brennan: To dis - What is the effect you're trying to dispel?
"Ally: Can I, like, have her get her hit points and stuff back? Would that like, is she under a spell that's like fucking with her right now?"
"Emily: It'd probably be a Greater Restoration, right?"
Brennan: You would need a Greater Restoration on her to-
"Murph: If you can do a Medicine check, I don't know what you have to buff yourself, but you have a d4. You'd have to hit a Medicine check that would get her to zero and stable and no more death save fails."
"Ally: That's sick. Okay, I will definitely… Oh boy."
"Siobhan: You'd have to get to me first though. Like, you're so far away."
"Murph: Or yeah, if you have Thunder Step or anything that-"
"Siobhan: Misty Step, Dimension Door."
Ally: I mean… I don't have any of those. I'm also rolling with disadvantage on all my checks.
Zac: Can you just fuckin’ annihilate Null?
"Siobhan: Oh, everybody has a level of exhaustion."
"Ally: Yeah, I'm just gonna do a, I'm just gonna do an attack, I guess."
"Siobhan: Wait, should I have been rolling with, oh it's at the end of my next turn that I'm exhausted."
"Zac: Or, I mean like… Sorry, I don't mean to suggest that if you have other options, it's just like - I’m trying to, like -"
"Ally: No, that's kind of all that I can do."
Emily: Kingston does have Revivify so there's hope in that.
Siobhan: Can you just attack-
"Ally: Okay, cuties."
Siobhan: Null?
"Ally: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna step up to right there, and then I am going to cast Disintegrate on Null."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: That's a Dex saving throw.
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Let's see here. Disintegrate. First off, Null is gonna use its reaction to Counterspell that Disintegrate."
Emily: I Counterspell it! Don't I have a Counterspell in my leopard print shirt?
Brennan: I believe you do. I believe you do.
Emily: I Counterspell his Counterspell!
Brennan: You gotta be 60 feet. It's gotta be 60 feet.
Emily: Oh shit.
"Siobhan: God, you're like 75."
Emily: Oops.
"Brennan: It's gotta roll. Its bonus to this is, hold on."
Zac: Does Sofia… Did that detergent do anything to you?
"Brennan: Yeah, Sofia is unstunned."
"Emily: It did, it unstunned me. But I haven't had a turn since it unstunned me to move."
"Brennan: Okay, so what's gonna happen-"
Ally: But that was last round? Okay.
"Brennan: Pete's casting a sixth level spell. Null's gotta roll an 11 or higher to Counterspell this. I'm gonna roll in front of the board. That's a nat one, baby."
Emily: Yeah!
Brennan: That's Disintegrate.
Ally: Why couldn't that have been the dex save?
Emily: Disintegrating nothing.
"Brennan: Counterspell does not work. Now it's gonna roll its saving throw. Does have magic resistance, so it's gonna roll this with advantage. Plus four both times. It just needs one of these to be a 13 or higher on its saving throw. One of these d20-"
Ally: I'm ready with a Bend Luck.
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Oh! 17\. Oh, it's 13 or higher?"
Brennan: So it got a 21.
Ally: [confused] What's up?
"Lou: But you said 13, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, 21."
Ally: So Bend Luck wouldn't work?
"Brennan: Bend luck would not work. It gets blasted with disintegrate, survives the assault, but wastes the Counterspell and is blasted back. That is going to be..."
Siobhan: Not gonna take reactions.
"Zac: Well, Null has legendary actions."
Brennan: It has legendary actions.
Siobhan: But.
"Ally: I'm going to actually, I'm gonna do… I'm going to Quicken Spell to have made that a bonus action and then use my full… Let's see. Let's see, oh man, you're so far. Motherfucker. I'm just gonna run up and just fuckin' lay over Iga."
Brennan: Cool. You lay over Iga. As a legendary action.
Ally: Oh! I didn't wild magic surge.
"Brennan: Oh shit! Pete, give me a wild magic surge for your last two turns. This one's one through eight."
Emily: Come on something good.
Ally: 11.
Brennan: One through nine. Give me another roll.
Ally: 16.
Brennan: One through 10!
Siobhan: God damn!
Emily: I feel like wild magic surges are good. I like wanted-
"Ally: Same, that's what I was thinking."
"Brennan: It is going to cast a spell. I'm going to need a, yeah, I'm gonna need a Charisma saving throw from you."
Ally: But I'm on top of Iga. Can she be targeted?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. 100%."
Ally: I'm pretty buff. I've actually been making some gains.
"Lou: Yeah, all that popcorn with olive oil, that fat."
Ally: Thank you!
"Brennan: DC 21. Iga, let me know what you get. Gonna need a 12 or higher on this roll."
"Lou: Fatty popcorn makes you buff, dude."
Ally: Yeah.
Siobhan gets a 3. Murph groans.
"Brennan: You all watch Null change tactics. Iga's incredible luck, and Null's sense that the tide is turning. You see Null cast Banishment. Using all three of its legendary actions casts banishment on Iga. [eerie whispering] You would know, Pete. It consumes Iga into a place of timelessness, which means that Iga is not, it's not gonna ever get to her turn because she is sucked into another realm and Null vanishes."
"Lou: Fuck you, Null."
Ally: Banishment puts her in a harmless demi-plane?
"Brennan: Yep. Pete, give me an Arcana check."
"Ally: I know, I know. I can banish someone and have them join her."
"Emily: Ooh! That's so cool, Pete!"
"Brennan: Pete, if you want to try to hit Null with a Banishment."
"Ally: Kingston with a, oh, Null with a Banishment."
"Brennan: If you want to hit Null with a Banishment on its way out as like a parting shot, I would let you roll some dope fuckin' arcana shit if you want to see what it's done to Iga."
Ally: Yes. Yes. I can roll an Arcana check right now?
"Brennan: Hell yeah. It's gonna try to make its save against your banishment. Hold on, this is pretty dope. We're making a bunch of shit up right now. Hold on."
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Null's only got a plus five. Null needs a 12 or higher here. That's an 11. Pete, you cover Iga with your body. Null is trying to unmake Iga. Kill her, have her magic go away. Instead you see that Null erases Iga. You hit Null with the Banishment and put a tag on Null, (correcting himself) or on Iga, as she is consumed by Null. Iga goes to a place of timelessness. Null despises time, wishes for nothing more than the end of time, the end of space, right? Iga is in a place where she can't be hurt. She is in the nothingness. Iga is in a place with Josefina Gatsby, with Hans Fischer, and Heather Simos beyond time. And Pete sees it. The things that Null has consumed. Death is a part of the natural cycle of life. What Null is doing is not nature, and the things it has consumed are in it somewhere. And as it retreats from the waking world, you guys see steam arising from all the walls. All the photos are still here. Null has used up all of the raw umbra in this place. There was not enough raw umbra here to even sustain its presence anymore. Pete, you know that Iga is gone somewhere, but… Either all of the universe will join Iga where she is in dissolution and void, or you will get her back. We exit initiative. Iga is gone. I think everyone else here sees Iga be vanished by Null as it vanishes and disappears."
Ally: Did her box go with her?
Brennan: Box is still there on the ground.
"Ally: Okay, I grab the box."
Brennan: All of you look at each other in the hollow silence of both Null's absence from this space and Iga's as well.
"[solemn, quiet piano]"
Lou: Okay.
"Zac: Are we still fucked up in the same way? Like, is our Wisdom still gone?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Cody and Ricky are fucked up. You guys are not looking good."
"Ally: Will Dispel Magic work on getting them their, like, charisma and stuff back?"
Brennan: Greater Restoration will.
Lou: I go around with the detergent and I give a Cody a splash and I give Ricky a splash.
[heavenly sound effects]
"Murph: Appreciate it, appreciate it."
Zac mimes taking a drink.
Lou: As we kind of all deal with-
Ally: Do you give yourself a splash?
"Pete: You gotta put your own oxygen mask on first, Kingston."
"Kingston: If you can believe it, Pete, my grandfather who, yeah, my grandfather touched me and I don't know, magic happened, per usual."
"Zac: Oh yeah, I forgot."
"Kingston: So, I'm all good."
"Pete: Oh, I met Alejandro, young sexy Alejandro (laughs) before all the smoking. He's a vet."
Kingston: Incredible. So about Iga.
"Cody: So, Iga's in the same place as the other—"
"Pete: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Iga is in, it's a harmless demiplane, but it is Null's, like, space. It's timeless and not in the cool, like, a trench coat is timeless way."
Cody: Right.
"Pete: This isn't a time to laugh, you guys."
"Sofia: Well, Kingston, if you saw Misty in the painting, maybe she could come out of the painting?"
"Kingston: Oh, that's not a bad idea."
Pete: What?
"Kingston: I guess, should I, y'all want me to go grab Misty?"
"Soifa: Seems like it, right?"
Cody: I don’t know who that is.
"Pete: Yeah! Or Rowan, but no, it's cool."
"Kingston: Well, it didn't seem like, I mean, I was completely disassociated from her when I met her. 'Cause, you know, Null. but it did seem like she didn't wholly remember me."
Sofia: Oh.
Ricky: Kingston?
Kingston: Yeah?
Ricky: I want you to tell your family that I'm sorry.
"Kingston: Why would I need to tell my family that you're, why would you need to apologize to my family? I'm assuming you went in there and explained that you needed the bouquet and you hopped right out."
"Ricky: Well, I, you know. Sometimes things don't go down like you want them to and I guess your grandmother or great-grandmother slapped me in the face when I ripped the bouquet from her hands and I ran away. I'm a leprechaun and, uh, good luck."
Kingston: What?
"Ricky: But I mean, your family seems like it's done well, so..."
"Kingston: Thank you. Well, I guess I'll go talk to my, I guess I'll go apologize to the people who are still alive later once we figure this out. So am I gonna go grab Misty, is that the plan?"
"Pete: Well, yeah."
Ricky: I'd love to have Misty here but are there other more pressing things?
[Zac laughs]
"Kingston: Well, my question is, can we perform the ritual now? Like, do we have everything we need?"
"Brennan: Kingston, so you guys are sitting here and again, I think that there is, you guys are stunned by Iga's sudden departure from this place. Pete has that revelation about the nature of how Null consumes these things. But Iga is very much suddenly gone. As it always has, the stakes surrounding this of like, not only do you need to defeat Null to save New York, if you can not defeat Null in a meaningful enough way, Iga will be gone forever, even if she never makes that third death saving throw."
"Pete: We should've put her in that box, man."
Sofia: I know.
"Brennan: But you look up at these photos. You have all the others. Kingston, this is everything you need. Ricky can summon those totems whenever you want, you just have to return these totems to the hoard of the Dragon of Bleecker Street, and you can do this."
"Kingston: Well, I mean-"
Pete: Let's do it.
"Kingston: Yeah, we do have everything we need to pop this off and really take it to Null."
Cody: All right.
"Lou: But yeah, can I bring people out of the paintings? I didn't know if that was a thing. But, well I took the leg so who knows."
"Brennan: Kingston, you go over and approach that drawing and the person in it by the way, was not Misty Moore. That was actually Holly Branch who was an earlier incarnation of the being that has been Misty Moore and Rowan Berry. You approach it. Cody, you begin to see sparks coming out of your pocket."
"Murph: Oh. I pull out, is it the Fairyland thing?"
Brennan: It's the chunk of the Fairyland sign.
"Cody: This thing is freaking out. Kingston, help. What is this?"
"Kingston: I don't, I'm not sure."
"Lou: I guess, I hold it maybe closer to the..."
Brennan: (Brennan mimics spark sounds) All of you are surrounded
"in a swirl of sparks from the Fairyland sign. Holly Branch from that drawing turns out to look at you. And having driven Null away from this place. All of those photos momentarily come to life in a swirl of sparkles around you. Pete, you see those Irish immigrants wave to you with the coin in your hand. You see little Jackson waves at Kingston and Sofia as you guys move away. Sofia, you see that dad has his little girl on the handlebars of his bicycle and waves to you and says,"
"Bicicleta Ancestor: Sofia! Goodbye, farewell. It is so good to see you! [Italian hand gesture]"
"Sofia: Bye, sorry, I didn't get to meet you!"
"Bicicleta: It's okay! It happens! You know, sometimes the saving throws they don't work out!"
"Sofia: Sometimes you roll nothin' but sixes, you know? Metaphorically."
"Bicicleta: Metaphorically speaking, I get it!"
"Brennan: And he scoots away on his bicycle. Siobhan, you okay if I throw a curveball your way?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: You guys appear in a scintillating amusement park. Roller coasters, ferris wheels, all around. Faeries flying everywhere. And as you do so, you see getting funnel cake and some cotton candy are Stephen Sondheim and one Rowan Berry who turns around to face you. Siobhan, what does Rowan say as her friends appear here in Fairyland next to her?"
"Siobhan: I say,"
"Rowan: Oh, it's you!"
"Siobhan: And then I look at Pete,"
"Rowan: Oh, it's you?"
"Siobhan: And then I notice Cody. And I'm like,"
"Rowan: [disapproving glance] And this, what's the situation right here? What's going on here?"
"Cody: I'm actually… This is kind of the mall that I work at. I know it's not a mall now, but this is kind of the mall. If that makes sense."
Rowan: Mm.
Cody: Fuck.
(Brennan laughs)
Rowan: I'm Rowan. Hi.
(Brian laughs)
"Ricky: We should let them have a couple minutes, right?"
Sofia: Yeah.
Emily: I walk away.
Lou: What space and time are we in? Are we in the past or are we in the present in like the Faerie realm?
"Brennan: It looks like you are fully in the present in Fairyland. It looks like after Null left, Cody's little chunk of the Fairyland sign activated, and as you went to reach out to Holly Branch in that photo it alerted Rowan Berry. Siobhan, Rowan has been very busy running Fairyland these last couple years. Stephen Sondheim turns to you and goes,"
"Sondheim: Rowan, darling. These were the heroes I was telling you about. When I met Cody here, he was a nude man with a triple sword."
Rowan: Nightmare.
Sondheim: One man's nightmare is another man's... bad idea.
"Emily: Sofia quietly remembers Iga pulling, the three of wands in the very beginning and looks at Cody."
(everyone laughs)
"Sondheim: In any case, these were the individuals I was mentioning that, if you notice how outside of Faerie and Nod everything is crumbling and falling apart and turning into-"
"Rowan: Right, yes. No, I do know most of them."
"Kingston: Yeah, we go way back."
Sondheim: I remember.
"Rowan: So, why is the world crumbling? Why haven't you called me? What's going on? I'm very busy. I'm wearing a pantsuit. I wear pantsuits now."
"Brennan: Yeah, Rowan is in a beautiful yellow pantsuit with a little silver flag pin and a short hair, like, pixie haircut."
"Emily: I'm gonna put my arm around Pete just for, like, some moral support."
Pete: Thanks.
Emily: But I do it in a way like I need his support. (laughs)
Pete: I got you. This is probably pretty awkward for you.
"Sofia: Thank you so much, Pete. Thank you so much. I'm going through so much."
Rowan: Are you okay? You all look like somebody died.
"Kingston: Well, they're not dead."
Cody: Somebody got kind of erased. But they're okay maybe?
Rowan: Okay.
Cody: Are we in the past?
"Rowan: No. No, this is now."
"Kingston: Cody, this is another part of Nod."
"Rowan: Don't eat anything here. You'll have to stay, though."
Kingston: Okay.
Rowan: So you know.
Ricky: Cody.
Zac: Just knocking all the food out of Cody's hands.
"Brennan: Cotton candy, funnel cake, deep fried Oreos. It's amazing."
Zac mimes ninja swiping Cody’s food away.
Cody: What?
[cast laughins]
Ricky: It's really unhealthy.
"Kingston: We are kind of up against, uh, this kind of monarch of dreams. And it's kind of wrecked the Sixth Borough pretty hard. And it's making a solid push on New York and just kind of took one of our friends into a timeless demi-plane where they will be trapped for the rest of time because there is no time there and New York will join them unless we can do something. So, we've been busy. So I'm sorry we haven't, we just haven't had a chance to catch up but it's so good to see you. And you look well, and this is fantastic."
Rowan: Thank you. It's so good to see you too. I'm so sorry. I feel like I… I've been just so busy for three years. [presses her hands to her temples] It's so boring.
"Kingston: You run a land. I mean, I can only imagine."
"Rowan: Just so many meetings. You wouldn't imagine. Faeries, you'd think, all fun and games. No. Lots of legislation apparently."
Sofia: When I was First Fist it was a lot of paperwork.
Rowan: Right!
Sofia: I'm not anymore though.
Kingston: That also happened.
Rowan: Is that a good-
Sofia: It doesn't feel good.
"Brennan: Rowan, go ahead and make an Insight check for me if you'd be so kind."
"Siobhan: Oh, I'm not Blessed as Rowan. Dirty 20."
"Brennan: You watch your bedraggled human friends that have just been through a whole hell of a lot looking up at you, and have one of those moments where you remember how tender and sentimental human beings are. Your friend Sofia apparently is no longer First Fist of the Monastery. Three years does not seem like a long time to Rowan. You feel a heaviness here. Things have gotten very bad outside, and you have been busy, but you're looking at some people that are in dire need of like, that have sacrificed a lot to get these resources together and are fighting something very vast and powerful."
Rowan: Let's go sit down somewhere. Let's go sit down. It's very loud here.
Kingston: That'd be nice.
"[gentle, soft piano music]"
"Brennan: In a beautifully appointed room with moss, like, sort of moss around and cushions, you guys enter a part of, like, almost like Central Park-esque ramble. Rowan, you are given some food and drink. Your guests are not because they don't want to be trapped here forever. And for the rest of you, all of you are looking at these seven objects that you have collected and saved here. Victorious in having gone and gotten everything Kugrash said about these objects were destroyed but not fully destroyed. And realizing that it meant the memory of them was not destroyed and you have saved those memories. You sit down with the leader of the Faerie court of New York City. And Rowan, I think you also see that Fairyland sign. Either make a perception check or an Arcana check for me."
Siobhan: I will do Perception. Still not great. That's an 11.
"Brennan: You can't crack the riddle on an 11, but you know that you have been struggling for years because Fairy has been having a hard time rooting itself in the mortal world. And you look at that sign Cody is holding and see potential in that sign. The rest of you look and see Rowan regarding you with a sort of look of paying attention. Like, you guys arrived in a blast of magic and now looking at how truly dire things have become."
"Ricky: Rowan, I feel like we, you know, I don't know if you're mad at me, or, you know, the rest of us."
Rowan: Not a person on this world has ever been mad at you. Sweet soft child.
"Ricky: I don't know about that. I'm not sure, but it does feel like we need some help right now. I mean, we have a bunch of, I know that like I have this very specific task to do to, like, help bring about this dragon of New York. But I don't know if you know any more about that kind of thing."
Sofia: Did you know the Bleecker Street Dragon?
"Siobhan: Did I? I mean, I must've done, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you knew the Bleecker Street Dragon, absolutely."
"Rowan: Yes, no, he was… Delightful. Loved pie!"
"Kingston: Yeah, he loved pie. Dutch pie specifically."
"Rowan: Big pie fan, and who can blame him?"
Kingston: Yeah.
Rowan: It's the little things. When you have that much power it's the little things.
"Kingston: That's what's doing New York in right now, it's those same little things."
"Rowan: Oh, no."
"Kingston: But we got them. That's what, I ran into your, I guess a reincarnate, a previous version of, you know?"
Rowan: That was you?
"Kingston: Yeah. I was all crazy. Yeah, I'd been disassociated from my personality for a second. So I don't think there was any, it was a real, you met me at a very strange time."
"Rowan: [shaking her head] Honestly, pretty sure that I had ergot poisoning at the time, everybody was going off the rails—"
Ricky: What's an ergot?
Rowan: —with weird hallucinogenic. It gets into the wheat and then you see things.
Kingston: Wow.
Rowan: It was a big problem back then.
Pete: That's what all the witches had.
Ricky: ….Oh.
(Brennan laughs)
"Brennan: Rowan, you sense Pete being quite strange around you."
Pete: Which is why they thought that there were witches.
"Cody: Totally, I've heard that too, Pete."
"Pete: Yeah, that's like people thought that women were doing magic but they were just poisoned by the wheat and they were hallucinating."
"Rowan: So, you two are friends? You two are friends? This is what the situation is?"
"Pete: Yeah, we're roommates! This is my really good friend. [puts his arm around Cody and grins]"
Ricky: Why did they all three have their arms around?
Rowan: Fascinating.
Emily: Sofia's still in there.
(everyone laughs)
"Sofia: You know, honestly, I've spent the night there."
Cody: Sofie lives with us sometimes.
Sofia: When I don't want to go home to my mother.
Pete: Yeah. It’s pretty much us three all the time.
(Emily laughs)
Zac: I put my arm around Kingston.
"Sofia: Honestly, it's just nice to be included."
Rowan: [putting her arms up] I want to get in on this. This seems nice.
Siobhan: I definitely position myself as far away from Cody as possible.
Lou: I don't blame you.
"Kingston: But yeah, Rowan we're in a bad spot. And I don't know. It's not often that, you know, the waking world is called on, you know, y'all for help. But if there's anything you could do in this moment as the leader, New York is in big, big trouble."
"Rowan: Well, honestly, I mean whatever affects New York affects here as well. There was strange things going on here as well. I just assumed that, frankly, that I wasn't very good at my job, which to be fair I don't know if I am very good at my job but it's sort of nice to know that maybe it's other things as well. Kingston, it's so boring."
"Kingston: Oh, come on, you get to wear a pantsuit. What a dream! And you look fantastic!"
Rowan: But everyday I have to wear a pantsuit. And then I have to get these people to agree with me.
"Kingston: I mean, yeah, people. Hey, organizing is tough when you're trying to get a bunch of people to see things and you have all these different point of views. It's a lot of work."
"Rowan: I would say it's like corralling cats but honestly, corralling cats, I've done it many times. Pretty easy in comparison."
"Kingston: Yeah, I used to watch Kug corral cats, and it was a snap of a finger for him."
"Sofia: Yeah, Kug ran a really good trap, neuter, release."
(everyone laughs)
Kingston: It was fantastic. He could corral cats-
"Ricky: You should see the way these cats react to him. Giant rat man, bunch of cats. You'd think there'd be more conflict."
Kingston: Herds of cats he would lead through the streets like a shepherd.
"Rowan: Ahh, the pied rat man of Hamlin."
Pete: He played a little flute.
"Sofia: Honestly, he was so charming, he didn't even have to trap them sometimes. It was just neuter, release."
(everyone laughs)
Rowan: Stab them in the balls and let them go.
Pete: He would play a little flute.
"Sofia: Play a little flute. Flute, neuter, release."
"Kingston: Flute, neuter, release."
"Pete: I have a question. Do we have a feeling like maybe bringing Fairyland back to the waking world would be some sort of restoration of, like, tradition and fun and memory?"
"Rowan: Oh, playfulness."
"Pete: Just, like, Cody and I watched like Astroworld, the, like, Travis Scott documentary. And like, it was pretty sick. Like, you know, they closed down Astroworld, and he was like, the kids need a cool fun place to like, go hang out with and make memories. Like, maybe this is like Queens' Astroworld is Fairyworld. And we can make sure it's gonna have a big music festival."
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: Cody, as Pete's talking about Astroworld. You remember studying about that place called Fairyland in Queens."
"Ally: Fairyland, got it."
Brennan: Yeah. Make a fuckin' history check.
Lou: Make a fuckin' history check. [laughs]
Murph: 17.
"Brennan: I think you might feel like knowing the Unsleeping City, Fairyland may have been some actual, like, gate to Faerie in the past. Might've been some connection to, like, actual fairies moving throughout New York in the past."
Murph: Okay.
"Cody: I know I was super confused when I first showed up and I thought we were in the past, but-"
(Emily laughs)
"Cody: There is some stuff going on. I do think that the old Fairyland which was an amusement park with the same name, maybe it had some kind of connection between Faerie, maybe it was like a gate between Faerie and the waking world and it got closed. And maybe this could be that again."
"Rowan: Yes, and then they built a terribly depressing mall on top of it, just full of chain stores."
Cody: Well it wasn’t depressing—
Pete: Actually it was pretty cool!
Cody: It's complicated. It's actually super complicated.
"Rowan: Really hard to negotiate. Kind of fizzing fluorescence the whole time, you never know where you are—"
Pete: Have you ever had a cinnamon pretzel while you're spending like $29.99 on a shirt?
(Brennan laughs)
Cody: Thank you.
Pete: Has that ever happened to you?
"Rowan: Yes, not to mention the fairgrounds—"
Sofia: Not to mention there was a good Super Cuts there.
Cody: There was a solid Super Cuts. That’s why my hair’s so long.
Pete: That’s fun. Lemonade with a cinnamon pretzel. Delicious combo.
Ricky: So do you think that—
Cody: I haven't got a haircut since Super Cuts closed.
Ricky: Whenever we’re done talking about Super Cuts...
"Sofia: [laughs] A lot of really good hairdressers worked at that Super Cuts, I'm telling you."
Cody: You guys wanna talk about Super Cuts?
Ricky: I could talk about Super Cuts forever.
(everyone laughs)
Zac: Ricky loves Super Cuts.
Cody: You guys wanna go to Super Cuts?
"Sofia: Yeah, maybe I'll go apply to work at Super Cuts."
Zac: 90% of Ricky's haircuts are from Super Cuts.
"Ricky: Well, I mean, if it was a real gateway to Faerie, and it really existed in the waking world in the past, then it is a part of New York's past."
Rowan: Yes.
"Ricky: That feels like something, that feels important in some way, right?"
"Brennan: Rowan, yeah, you look at that piece of the Fairyland sign and feel power spreading out around you. I think Rowan probably feels like you maybe have some work to do here in Faerie. You've been trudging through bureaucracy and Fae nonsense for a long time. This may be a missing link of what you've been working on, that's been keeping you from your friends for years. I think Rowan probably feels like there's work to be done here. I know that the mortal human beings of the champions of New York definitely have shit to do back in the waking world."
"Sofia: Do you have a library here, Rowan?"
Siobhan: Is there?
"Brennan: Hell yeah! I mean, Siobhan, you're in charge of Fairyland in New York. You do it, whatever you think. There's a library there, there's a fuckin' library there. Hell yeah."
"Rowan: Yes, but it's mostly theater history."
(Brennan laughs)
Rowan: It's like VCRs of every Broadway show and lots of-
Ricky: Illegally taped footage?
Rowan: Illegally taped footage.
Sofia: I'd love to take out a bootleg of Kinky Boots.
(Murph laughs)
Ricky: Does that mean you would have to watch Kinky Boots forever? What are the rules here?
Rowan: I think your mom would love this one. Moms love Kinky Boots.
"Sofia: Okay, well then I won't try to use, I won't stick around and try and study in your library."
Brennan: Awesome. You guys part ways. It's not gonna be a sweat for you guys to get back to the waking world from here. You have Pete with you. You guys are mortal beings that will have an easy time getting back. You'll probably show up back around Broadway or the theater district.
"Rowan: Steve, darling, you're in charge. Sorry, I'll be back soon."
Brennan: And Rowan's going to go back out with them to the waking world?
"Siobhan: Yeah, I think so."
Brennan: Hell yes. You guys go back to the waking world.
"Ally: I mean, as we're walking, I feel like maybe I kind of like walk slower next to Rowan, and I'm like,"
"Pete: Hey, umm, so-"
Rowan: Hi. You disappeared off the face of the-
"Pete: Apologizing always feels, hm?"
Rowan: You disappeared off the face of the planet. Where did you go?
Pete: Me?
Rowan: Yeah!
(Zac laughs)
"Pete: I, well, see, so the thing is I… So as you know (laughs) I was just very, I was on a lot of drugs the last time we hung out, and I actually don't do drugs anymore."
Rowan: Where's your hat?
"Pete: What's up? I'm different now. You know, I work at a bookstore. I don't throw up and cry. I don't embarrass people in front of like all their friends in their cool apartment because I'm nervous. Just, you know-"
Rowan: Have you been avoiding me for three years because you threw up in front of me?
"Pete: Yeah, but then I cried."
"Rowan: Pete, I've been alive for hundreds of years."
"Pete: For sure. Of course, you've probably seen, you've seen dysentery. That's probably not dissimilar."
"Rowan: I mean, it was a lot of vomit and you did cry very snottily."
"Pete: I did. You know when someone's like too fucked up and they're like, I'm too fucked up (groans) and like they’re making you do a lot of labor."
Rowan: I do remember.
"Pete: Yeah, so that they can seem self-aware… Yeah, that's… That's what I remember. So anyway, I found vomit on my belt two weeks later which kind of memories started coming back, and I was just more and more embarrassed of what happened. And also what I didn't remember had happened. And I'm still pretty chaotic, but I'm working on not relying on that as a personality trait. And anyway, it's good to see you."
"Rowan: Yeah, good to see you."
Pete: This is my chip.
Siobhan: I ruffle Pete's hair a little bit.
Pete: (laughs) No… That's funny though.
"Rowan: Wait, let me see this chip."
Siobhan: I pull the chip out of Pete's hand.
"Pete: Been going to some meetings. It's an anonymous program, so you really aren't just supposed to show your chip around but to you, I needed you to know."
Rowan: [nods] Good job.
Pete: Thanks.
"Rowan: Yeah. You seem well, you seem really well. You don't seem like... skeletal."
Pete: What's up?
[Lou laughs]
Rowan: You don't seem skeletal.
"Ricky: Hey guys? It feels like we got a bunch of shit to do, I don’t know what’s-"
"Pete: For sure, for sure, for sure."
"Rowan: Yes, I haven't been here in ages, and I do need to have, like, anything from a bodega. Just anything."
Ricky: Let's get that on the way.
"Zac: I think Ricky is looking at his new watch, and is like,"
"Ricky: Why don’t we, we gotta fuckin' move, right? I don’t know what’s going on."
Kingston: Iga is suspended in time.
(everyone laughs)
Zac: I start slapping everyone in the face.
Rowan: Who’s Iga?
"Brennan: You guys, cool. You guys dip the fuck outta here. You guys tell me, what do you guys do?"
Lou: Can I use Word of Recall to get back to the dragon's hoard?
Brennan: Hold on one second.
Emily: Oh right. It's time to hatch the dragon.
Murph: Hell yeah.
"Lou: Or can I just go there? I don't know how to get there, but Word of Recall allows me to return to sanctuaries that I've been to."
Zac: Whoa.
Brennan: You did not have the ability to prepare the dragon's hoard as a sanctuary.
"Emily: Wait, it was magically hidden in the subway though, right?"
"Lou: Yeah, I know where it is."
Sofia: Maybe some of Kug's friends that we just met on that little hot dog stand.
Ricky: I can talk to Marty and he'll probably know.
"Rowan: Oh no, not the stinky cockroach."
Ricky: He's a juicy cockroach.
"Sofia: Juicy, yeah."
"Ricky: He maybe used to be stinky, but he's at least also juicy now."
Pete: He's wearing little sweat pants that say juicy on the butt.
(Emily laughs)
"Cody: But like the rat himself smells like shit, but the juicy cockroach actually smelled fine."
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You reach out to old friends of Kugrash. Rats, cockroaches, everything like that. And you hear back from Marty."
"Marty: Hey, buddy, you got it. We're gonna get all the bugs and everything. We're gonna find this fuckin' dragon's hoard. You better believe it, bud! We're on it, we're on it now!"
Ricky: Thank you. And I love the sweatpants. I feel like that's a great addition.
"Marty: Yeah, I just like to lounge around the house. You know, that's what I'm interested in doing."
Emily: It actually makes sense that they would have a pair of juicy sweatpants considering like that style is so old you could only find it at a thrift store.
Zac: It got so old that it became a doll's toy clothing.
Siobhan: Yes. Shrunken down.
Ally: Sometimes you say things just for the fan art.
(everyone laughs)
"Brennan: Cool. You guys get bugs on finding these. So Word of Recall will not get you there, Kingston. 'Cause you were not able to set that place up as a sanctuary."
Zac: I feel like we have to talk to Iga's family.
Brennan: Probably.
Lou: That feels good.
"Brennan: And Pete you have the chest, right? Yeah, who wants to bring the chest to Iga's family?"
"Ally: Definitely, I'll go and do that. Yeah, I have the chest."
Zac: Should we all go?
"Ally: Yeah, let's do it."
"Brennan: Cool. All of you head out. Oskar's there. Nick and Jess are there. They take the chest from you. Nick is very protective over it. (sighs) As much as Pete tries to explain the fact that Iga is in this place where it is eminently possible that she can be retrieved, it is hard for this family to hear, and you feel the mounting of the pressure on you to get this right. So much has already gone right for you guys. You have collected so many of the resources that you need to make this work. You have been so triumphant over and over again, but you've also realized that if you can't stick the landing, no pun intended, all will be lost."
"Zac: Wait, I don't want to say this in front of the family but can I ask everyone else, like,"
Ricky: Do you think it's worth talking to Nick—
Sofia: Dragon?
Ricky: And seeing if he can get us in the chest to talk to the dragon?
Kingston: Definitely.
Sofia: Sure.
Brennan: Nick shares with you that he is not powerful enough to get all of you into the chest.
"Emily: Oh, right, that was a special warlock ability."
"Brennan: But he can try to communicate something for you. He looks up, Jess looks very shaken. She's like,"
Jess: I got to talk to Ana and Amelia at the society about this.
"Brennan: And Nick looks up and says,"
Nick: What is it? What is it you want me to ask the dragon? I can try to ask something.
"Ricky: What do you think, Kingston? Is there anything that feels right to you?"
"Kingston: I mean, the things in my head are like, can you ask, oh, I've never truly had to say her name and I know I'm gonna say it wrong. So please correct me as soon as I say it, Nick. Smodka? Smishsmodka?"
Nick: Smoczmatka.
"Kingston: Smoczmatka, there you go. Will never say it wrong again. Is there a chance, like I think, like we're asking Smoczmatka, like, where a hoard would be or, yeah. How does a hoard move? Yeah. Or does a hoard move? I guess the nature of hoards."
Cody: Does it get buried with when the dragon dies?
"Brennan: You see later after you guys depart from the Lisowski family, Nick and Jessica vowing to, you know, make this right and help any way they can. Nick sends a message to all of you basically saying dragon hoards should be easy to find. And that if you're not able to find it, especially if you've been there before, something's wrong."
Pete: The memory of it was erased!
Lou: Is it still in my head?
"Brennan: Yes, still in your head. You got it."
Sofia: Do we have a piece of it at all? Because maybe we could use the time piece to go into the piece of it.
Lou: I hold up the eternal token.
"Brennan: You hold up the eternal token. It feels, you can definitely, it feels worth trying. You can experiment with that with the Gotham Timepiece and are busy putting this, sort of, putting this together. Nick says he's gonna keep trying to look into what Smoczmatka knows as you guys are all on top of this together. I'm going to move us forward in time now. The bugs begin to look for it. Days pass as the bugs are looking for the dragon's hoard. We are going to enter another period of downtime now. And it is a period of downtime marked by a growing sense of dread as Marty and the others prove unable to find the original hoard of the Dragon of Bleecker Street. What I'd like from all of you now is what your characters are doing in the interim while this place is being searched for and Christmas draws ever closer."
Lou: Kingston's at that phone every day.
"Brennan: Kingston, we're gonna do straight up two weeks of downtime right now. Go ahead and roll that percentile dice 14 times for me if you would be so kind."
"Lou: Yeah, I'd love to. God, this is not fun if they don't come up the way I want them to. [sorting through his dice] Okay, so I didn't like you last time. I didn't like you last time. Here we go. Okay."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Lou: 14 times?
Brennan: 14 times! Here we go.
"Lou: First one. It's gotta be 11 or less, right, on 2d10?"
Brennan: 11 or less on a 2d10.
Lou: First one is 16.
(everyone winces)
"Lou: Second one is 32. Third one's 30. Fourth one, 25. Fifth one, 72. Sixth one, 51. Okay, swapping out dice. Let's get a new team in there. See if they-"
Zac: How do you roll an 11 or lower?
"Lou: It'd be 10 and one or then zero, zero in anything. This is seven. 16 again."
Murph: Oh my God.
Lou: 99.
Siobhan: Oh my God.
Lou: How many more do I have?
Brennan: You have five more.
Lou: That's 40.
"Murph: Okay, this is the one. This is the one. It's happening. Guaranteed!"
Lou: 76.
Murph: Fuck!
Lou: Three more.
Brennan: Three more.
Lou: Three more?
Brennan: Three more.
Murph: This is insane.
Lou: [quietly] God dammit. 40.
Brennan: Two more.
Lou: Two more?
Brennan: Two more.
Lou: It's cocked. 26.
Brennan: Last one.
"Lou: Please. Kingston is like, doin' that thing where you like, press your head, like, against the like, just pressing just like before he puts the coin in, just like head against the metal, just praying. ...56."
"Brennan: Brutal. Kingston goes looking for that Divine Intervention every day. Do not find it. But you guys do have non-miraculous things at your disposal. What is everybody else doing during that two week period as the bugs, again, that mounting feeling of dread, the bugs are not finding it. What is everyone doing during this, like, tense mounting period of downtime?"
Zac: Do we think someone should talk to the Shen family maybe? Maybe they have any guidance for this? I don't know.
"Siobhan: Yeah, that's a good idea. I feel like Misty would probably know them. I think Misty could maybe do that. I mean Rowan. Rowan would probably know them."
"Brennan: Yeah, what do you want to go talk to them? Oh, you wanted to talk to them about the dragon's hoard?"
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: Cool. Go ahead and give me a DC 20, DC 20, we'll call it a Perception check."
Siobhan: Okay. I have a plus seven to perception.
Brennan: Cool.
"Siobhan: No, I don't make it. I get a 14."
"Brennan: The Shen family is as confused as you. They explained to you that the hoard should be easy to find. It should be on Bleecker Street. I think they do also explain that the hoard was on Bleecker Street because that's where the dragon wanted it. But that the hoard could actually be anywhere. Like, that hoard can appear at that secret subway stop wherever someone wants, wherever the dragon wants it to in the city."
Siobhan: Why don't we ask the egg?
"Brennan: Not a terrible idea. Rowan, that is your downtime activity. Towards the end, you're, like, out of answers. You're thinking about, like, it has to be the egg. Pete, or sorry, anyone else? What are you doing during that two weeks? As you can feel you're so close, and yet this last piece of the puzzle is eluding you."
"Murph: I guess… Maybe I'll text Ricky because I think we both have Locate Object. I wonder if we can like investigate areas that we, like, essentially ask Kingston, like what do you remember? Is there something you remember seeing there?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Murph: And then being like, okay, we'll check out Bleecker Street. We'll go to, if we know it was originally brought to, if we know the dragon was originally brought to Chinatown, we'll go to Chinatown, and I'll just ride around on my moped with, like, a homing beacon casting Locate Object every day, I guess."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Well, go ahead and give me like, as a downtime activity, give me an Investigation check."
Murph: 18.
Zac: Should I get one too?
"Brennan: Yeah, Ricky, you should give me one as well."
"Zac: Pretty good. Investigation, that would be a 19."
Murph: We should use Bless maybe. That would make things easier.
Brennan: I think over the span of time-
Murph: Over the span it's not gonna work?
"Brennan: Yeah. You guys are looking and looking and looking. You guys look hard, just like trying to sort of investigate, cast Locate Object yourself. Something is you guys get just like a sinking feeling. Something is weird."
Ally: [softly] Fuck.
Brennan: What is Pete getting up to during downtime?
Ally: I'm going to meetings with Lugash.
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: And then it’s maybe, like, Maddie's birthday or something. Like, I might just be, like,"
"Pete: Do you wanna like get a coffee? Or like, what do you usually do on your birthday, or, whatever? LOL."
"Brennan: “LOL.” Maddie hits you back up and is like, is like,"
"Maddie: I don't have a lot of close friends in the city. A lot of my friends are online, but it would be awesome to do something in person for my birthday."
Pete: Cool.
"Brennan: Pete, your sobriety die moves up to a d12, which is-"
"Ally: [resigned] No, it's a d10."
"Brennan: Oh, it's a d10. Copy that."
Ally: I shot down when Danny wanted to buy drugs from me.
(Brennan laughs)
"Ally: But we're back at a d10, baby! We're back at a d10!"
Brennan: Back at a d10.
Ally: This is where I'm comfortable. It's the most beautiful shape.
Brennan: You and Maddie have a lovely birthday celebration together for her birthday.
Ally: Cute.
Brennan: Truly lovely.
"Ally: I get her that book, ""Kitchen."""
Zac puts his face in his hand.
"Ally: That's like a really old like book. It just has like a really interesting trans character in it. And it's just, like, fun to read. Like,"
"Pete: Hey, it's by this writer Banana Yoshimoto. It's like pretty cool. It's like early magical realism from like the 80s or 90s. And I don't know. I just thought it was pretty cool. So..."
"Brennan: She smiles and says,"
"Maddie: Well, thanks. I always love a gift that like, you know, keeps on giving. It's like, oh, I'll be able to enjoy this for a while. That's awesome, Pete. Thank you. And you said you're Aquarius, right?"
Pete: Yeah.
"Maddie: So I got time to think of a gift for you. Good, good, good."
"Pete: Yeah, totally."
"Brennan: The only two people I need answers from are Sofia and Kingston. Kingston, I know you've been doing your Divine Intervention rolls, but you still have your downtime. What is Sofia doing during this time?"
"Emily: I think Sofia has been feeling like she's carrying this life in her, right? But she can't really celebrate it until she tells Dale, but she can't tell Dale until she figures out the best way to do it or a way to do it that's not just painful. But I think she's been feeling really, like, isolated and selfish because of this. So, I think she is gonna, like, she's just gonna use her time to try to help. So, I think two things she'd like to do, one, she'd like to, like, contact Nadia and see if she could get into the library to look for if they might have any information about a hoard and how to find it. And then she also kind of wants to contact Tony and ask him if he wanted to get coffee."
Brennan: Go ahead. I'm gonna let Sofia do both of these things. And I believe that's gonna move you down to a d8 if I'm not mistaken.
Emily: That's fine. I feel like I have been nothing for a while.
(Emily laughs)
Brennan: Oh no!
Emily: She wants to contribute.
"Brennan: I think you reach out. Go ahead and give me an Arcana check for Nadia and go ahead and give me a, I guess it can be Perception, it can be Insight for Tony."
"Emily: Okay. My Arcana was a six, and my perception is 18."
Brennan: 18\. You reach out to Nadia. Nadia gets back to you
"and is basically like,"
"Nadia: So sorry. So sorry, Sofia. Nothing about specific locations of the dragon hoard."
Sofia: Okay. Thank you so much for looking. How is everyone doing by the way?
"Brennan: She's like,"
Nadia: It's great. We just went on this retreat with the occult society. Went super well. We're gearing up for the expedition around New Year's.
Sofia: Amazing.
"Nadia: Really, really good."
"Brennan: You get a ping on your phone from Tony texting you back saying,"
Tony: Coffee sounds great.
Emily: Great. I think I'm gonna swing by and talk to my dad really quickly. 'Cause I want to get some information from him above the board.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You swing by your old family home and find your dad watching the game, drinking a cold one."
Emily: Sweet.
"Sofia: Hey, Dad. What's up? Long time no see."
"Anthony: Sofia, what the fuck are you doing here? It's cold as hell."
"Sofia: Yeah, it's just the holiday, so, you know, just figured I'd stop by. Anyways I ran into a friend of yours, Tony Simos. You remember him?"
"Anthony: Yeah, Tony. Yeah, I remember Tony. He's a fuckin' hothead. He's a lunatic."
"Sofia: Yeah, lunatic, right? 'Cause that he had some, some wife or something like that?"
"Anthony: Yeah, she left him though. She fuckin' bailed middle of the night. Fuckin' left his ass."
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah, cool, cool. Thanks so much. That's just the information I need."
Anthony: This is unreal. What the fuck?
(Emily laughs)
Anthony: What the fuck? You come here to talk to me about some fuckin' guy from the neighborhood?
"Emily: I send my unseen servant to go grab, like, a present from like a liquor store and I'm like,"
"Sofia: Yeah, actually I was here to drop off this. It's a can opener."
(everyone laughs)
"Sofia: You like Beck's, right? The beer?"
"Anthony: [placated] Yeah, yeah, I like Beck's. Shit, okay. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Shit, okay."
Murph: A Beck's bottle opener?!
(everyone laughs)
"Sofia: Merry Christmas, Dad."
Lou: A single bottle of Beck’s.
Ally: That is the funniest specific— (laughs) Oh my God.
(everyone laughs)
"Emily: And with that, I want to go meet up with Tony. I basically needed to get the information about him so that I could tell him that I heard from my dad without lying."
"Brennan: Copy that. You go and meet Tony for coffee. He's waiting for you when you get to the cafe, looks up and says,"
"Tony: Sofia, good to see you. How ya doin'?"
"Sofia: I'm good. I just wanted to talk to you because I learned something about you that I think we have in common, and I don't meet a lot of other people who experience it. And I guess I just wanted to reach out. I don't know if I'm looking for advice or consolation or maybe to say like, I see you in a different light now."
Tony: What's the different light you see me in?
"Sofia: I'm gonna bring up something that's personal, but I want you to know that it's coming from someone who also experienced it. I heard around the block about what happened with your wife."
(Tony exhales)
"Sofia: I just wanted to reach out because I obviously lost my husband. And it's something that I still don't fuckin' know how to deal with. And when I learned that, it just, I felt for you and I wish I had known that. And if I offended you by bringing this up, I'm super sorry."
"Tony: Nah, it's all right. You lost Dale. And I know how much that hurt you. I know there's bad blood here, but Dale was a good guy. And… Hurts, yeah, you know. Wife just up and left."
"Brennan: You see him like giving you the, like, waking world version of events. Like, not sharing the other stuff with you."
"Tony: Yeah, I don't know where she is. I hope wherever she is she's happy."
"Emily: Fuck, can I do, I'm like, I want to do some kind of check. I almost want to, like, I kind of want to tell him then he'll know. Fuck, I really want to tell him. I guess maybe I'm just gonna say, I just think I'm just gonna try to be human and say like,"
"Sofia: I don't know. I guess just, like, maybe just tell me how you moved on or tell me how you found a life after that. Maybe that'll help me. And I don't know. Maybe it's just nice to talk about with someone who's gone through the same thing."
Brennan: He nods.
"Tony: I don't know. I don't know if you ever do move on. You know, if you got a big heart, you can… The stronger you are, the more muscle you got inside to carry those hurts for a long time. I've been carrying mine for a while but no use in letting them make you weak, you know. It's hard. I tell you, Sofia, I give you credit, you know. Imma be honest. I feel like a fuckin' loser."
Sofia: Why?
"Tony: Coming back here, old dog fuckin' trying to be First Fist again, make up for something that happened so many years ago. Why would I even… Why would I do this to myself, put myself through all this hurt? Sitting here at this fuckin' retreat with the society, giving us the run around. Fuckin', you know, there's no fuckin', we're not going on an expedition. It's obvious that it's all a fuckin' hoax."
Sofia: What?
"Tony: You know, the expedition it's fugazi, it's not real. Like, you know, we're getting jerked around."
"Sofia: Why, how? I mean, I'm friends with Esther. I can talk to her."
Brennan: I'm gonna need Sofia to give me a deception roll.
"Emily: [sighs] Okay, wait, all of these dice have rolled poorly for me today. Six."
"Siobhan: God, these sixes."
"Brennan: Tony looks over at you and says,"
"Tony: Well, maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. Maybe it's all real. Maybe I'm just paranoid. Hey, this was real nice of you, Sof. I appreciate it."
Sofia: Yeah.
"Tony: I'm gonna head back to the monastery. Thank you for your time, Sof. Appreciate it."
"Emily: I mean, I guess I'm gonna text the group and be like,"
"Sofia: I was trying to get some context for him, suss him out. Obviously I fuckin' made things worse again. Should I just fuckin' tell him that we have a way to get Heather Simos back and maybe he'll just fuckin' get on board?"
[players mumble in thought]
Cody: Yeah.
"Emily: All right, I chase him out of the coffee shop."
Sofia: Tony!
Brennan: Cool. He turns around.
"Sofia: Tony. Look, yeah, okay. The meeting, look, I met with you under a pretense that wasn't true, but the core of why I wanted to meet with you was true. I know what happened with Heather. And I think we can get her back."
Tony: You know what happened with Heather?
Sofia: I know what happened with Heather. And I think we can get her back.
Tony: How?
"Sofia: We just lost, do you remember the woman with the chest?"
"Tony: Yeah, Lisowski."
Sofia: We just lost her to a timeless pocket dimension that Heather is in.
"Tony: Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's somewhere out there?"
"Sofia: Yes, she was, you know her magical purpose, right?"
"Tony: Yeah, she was the Vox Phantasma."
Sofia: Yes.
Tony: Nod made her the Vox Phantasma.
"Sofia: Yeah because Nod believed in her. And she brought so much enthusiasm that Nod couldn't totally work with just yet. And she went too deep into dreaming, and she got sucked up by something. And I think we can get her back."
Tony: Holy shit. Oh my God. How do we get her back?
"Sofia: I don't know. What we need to do is, well, we're trying to get a dragon. I know you don't believe in dreams, but this dragon could bring a lot of people back."
Brennan: Give me an insight check if you'd be so kind.
Emily: Oh no. It's gonna be another six.
Murph: Jesus Christ.
Zac: Are you kidding me?
Siobhan: Throw your dice away.
"Emily: Well it's plus three, so it's a nine. Yeah."
"Brennan: Tony says,"
"Tony: Look if this is true, that's fuckin' incredible. That's fuckin' incredible. Listen, we got to talk. You and me, let's talk tomorrow. Come by the monastery, you know, like four o'clock in the afternoon and we'll get it going. Absolutely."
"Sofia: Tony, don't fuck me for letting you in on this, okay?"
"Tony: I'm not gonna fuck you, okay?"
"Sofia: Okay. Well that could be not a lie, but also (laughs) You're gonna fuck me, aren't you?"
"Brennan: You see, he looks at you and says,"
Tony: You bringing this up means a lot.
Brennan: And Tony heads off into the night.
"Sofia: Okay, well, I did it, everyone. And I think it was probably a mistake."
(everyone laughs)
Ricky: Really interesting.
Kingston: I doubt it.
"Pete: No, trust your intuition. Trust your insight."
Rowan: Who is this guy? Do you want me to beat him up? He sounds bad.
Sofia: I feel as though pregnancy has been terrible for me and I haven't had a good day since-
Rowan: You're pregnant?
(everyone laughs)
"Rowan: Well, let me throw you a shower."
Sofia: I can't have a fuckin' shower until I tell my dead husband. And I can't tell my dead husband 'til I can figure out if I can fuckin' bring him back!
Pete: Understandable.
"Sofia: Thank you. Okay, I'm not crazy."
Rowan: Actually I've had a not dissimilar situation before so-
Sofia: Tell me more.
Rowan: Many lifetimes!
"Brennan: I'm gonna say, Sofia, give me one last, I'm gonna ask for a either Arcana or Religion check with advantage."
Emily: [laughs] Cool. Why not?
Siobhan: Two sixes.
"Emily: Ooh! Okay. Uh, 19."
"Brennan: You are talking and you remember years ago at the Clinton Hill Chantry there was a book of some kind specifically about, like, the dead and necromancy and stuff like that. And as you say this thing to Rowan of, like, ""I can't do any of this until I can figure out if there's a way to bring my dead husband back,"" your mind just goes to this thing at the Clinton Hill Chantry and you know that there's something that you should check out there. The last person I want to talk to-"
Emily: I also do one last thing. I just want to shoot a text to Esther that I fucked up. So that she's on her game.
"Brennan: She says,"
"Esther: Okay, I'm on it."
"Brennan: She says, she's like,"
Esther: Don't worry about it. I'm on it.
"Brennan: Cool. Kingston, what are you doing during those two weeks of downtime while the dragon's hoard is being searched for?"
"Lou: I think, Kingston is, like, talking to the egg. And if anything, I think I like take the egg with me out into the streets, like, in and around the areas that I used to, like, you know- like, walking that same path."
Zac: Is it in a stroller?
"Lou: Yeah, I have a little stroller out. And me and the egg are just like walking around, and I'm just like,"
Kingston: How do you feel about this place? Is this anything?
(Emily laughs)
"Kingston: Let's keep, let's keep moving. All right, here we go. Here we go."
"Lou: Yeah. Kingston, I would like even like burn my, like, Gotham timepiece, like, you know, level of exhaustion after downtime. Like, Kingston is upset and really wants to figure this out."
"Emily: I think you might not want to do that though, because you'll get disadvantage on ability checks. That's what exhaustion is."
Lou: Is that after the downtime?
"Brennan: That's after the downtime. Yes, yes, yes."
"Lou: I'll take it. If it's after, I'll take it."
"Brennan: Cool. Kingston is going with the egg. Go ahead and give me a, you can give me an insight check and then that extra action lets you do an extra downtime activity. So if there's something you want to do other than the dragon."
Lou: I guess I'll use it if this doesn't work.
"Brennan: Cool. Go for it. Yeah, yeah."
Lou: That will be a 28.
"Brennan: Kingston, it is the morning. It's been two weeks. The egg keeps stopping at this one area on Central Park North, the North side of Central Park. But it keeps stopping in a place where there is no, like, subway entrance. It's near 110th Street, but you keep stopping in this area. With that 28 perception, Kingston, you're holding the egg, and you haven't used your extra actions. You don't have exhaustion."
Lou: I haven't used it yet.
"Brennan: At the end of that downtime, Kingston, you're walking with the egg. You keep stopping at a place with no subway entrance. You look at yourself in a mirror. Umbra is pouring out of your eyes. This dragon's hoard is find-able, but not if it's being hidden from you. And there's only one thing powerful enough in this city to hide the unseen from those who see the unseen every day. Something is wrong with Gramercy."
Zac: Oh shit.
Ally: Holy shit!
Siobhan: God damn.
"Brennan: This is the next day. Sofia, Esther texted you this morning being like,"
"Esther: Hell yeah, come by the Clinton Hill Chantry to look for whatever you need. I'll be up, like, I should be upstairs in the apartment if you want to come say hi. Don't worry about Tony. I'm gonna handle him. Ricky will be out at Helping Hands tomorrow."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: And Sofia, you are riding, or I guess you're taking your car up through Clinton Hill."
Emily: Take the Verrazano Bridge.
"Brennan: Take the Verrazano Bridge. As you have said, Sofia is in not a great way right now."
Emily: I think I know what she needs to do.
"Brennan: As you are driving, you look over and see a flickering image just in the mirror of a passenger in your back seat that is a colorless silhouette."
Emily: Can I pull over and punch it?
"Brennan: Yeah, you turn around, punch it. It's not even really in your back seat. It's just in the reflection, and Sofia, you are a woman pulled over on the side of the road, punching the back seat of your own car."
"Sofia: This is not my low, if you can believe it."
(everyone laughs)
"Brennan: You hear a voice in your own mind ask you,"
Voice: It only hurts because you keep fighting. If you stopped fighting it wouldn't hurt anymore.
"Ally: Can I roll an intuition luck check? To maybe just shoot Sofia, like, a friendly text, like, ""Hey, just happened to be thinking about you."""
"Brennan: Yeah, I'm gonna let Sofia respond first. If she's going to respond and then I'll let Pete roll."
"Emily: I think that Sofia knows not to fully buy this. I think that part of her realized, like, you know, having a dream in your heart is amazing. But I think that in her very literal situation she needs to make peace with the fact that she can't necessarily fix this situation so that she can… I think she hasn't known what to do whether or not to tell Dale or not 'cause she keeps thinking I'm going to fix it. But the longer it goes on the more guilty she feels about not telling him. And it's just like, it just has to come to, it just has to stop. So, I think she's maybe just, like, does she know how to contact Dale?"
Brennan: She could try to go to JFK.
Emily: That sounds like a big endeavor.
(Brennan laughs)
"Emily: Okay, I think that she, I don't want to take up that much time."
(Ally laughs)
"Brennan: No, I think that's beautiful. I think you should. I think you, and Ally go ahead and roll that luck check for..."
Ally: Hey! 17.
"Brennan: Yeah, Sofia, you're thinking of not going to JFK. You get a text from Pete. What does the text from Pete say?"
"Pete: Hey, was just doing my morning pages and you came up as always. I'm just so appreciative of you and hope you're doing great. I went on a date this week, which felt kind of selfish. So just wondering if you need help with anything. I would love to help."
Ally: It's a lot. It's a wall of text.
"Eemily: Sofia writes back and she says,"
Sofia: I do need one thing. I need you to tell me all about your date.
(Brennan laughs)
Pete: Great! So I got her a freakin' book. I hope she likes it. I felt kinda stupid. What are you up to?
"Sofia: Pete, I think I'm gonna tell Dale. Do you think that's the right thing? I've been so fucked in my head about whether or not I should, whether or not I should tell him or not tell him. And I've just, I think it's felt so inhibiting."
"Pete: That's a really big decision and I'm here with you if you need help. I can even take you to Nod, and we can go to the magical JFK and try to see him."
"Sofia: Okay, yeah."
"Pete: It's better than the real JFK, I promise. We can just fly there. There's no Uber or Lyft."
"Sofia: Yeah, okay."
"Brennan: Pete and Sofia, you're at JFK, and you look up and see the pearly gates. You see the light up there. You know that what you say here will be heard by anybody waiting for you at the gates. You don't even have to go into the airport."
"Emily: I just have to shout it? (laughs) Oh, fuck me."
"Sofia: Pete, hold my fuckin' hand."
"Ally: Yeah, I'm holding your hand, and I'm just kind of squeezing it at, like, soothing intervals. Just like thinking about ya."
(Emily laughs)
"Emily: Okay. I guess I'll just say,"
"Sofia: Hey hun, I'm pregnant. It's obviously yours. I wanted to find a way to bring you back before I told you, but I need to stop hanging on to that. So at least I need to stop hanging on to that. I just had to fuckin' tell you. It felt so fucked up to not tell you. So that's the situation. I've been writing every single memory I can remember of you. And I promise no matter what you are gonna be in this child's life in every fuckin' way I can make that happen."
"Brennan: The light gleams, and you are followed back to the waking world by a beam of sunlight that even when you return to waking keeps clipping out through the clouds behind you. As you arrive at the Clinton Hill Chantry, did Sofia bring all the letters she's been writing about Dale with her or no?"
"Emily: No, I mean, she's definitely got that at home."
"Brennan: Gotcha, so is it weird for Sofia when she sees all of them in a book on the table in the Clinton Hill Chantry?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: A spot of sunlight is shining on a book in the Clinton Hill Chantry called ""The Axioms and Laws of Paradise."""
Emily: I pick it up and read it. I'm a pretty active reader now.
"Brennan: Pete, you're with Sofia in this moment."
"Ally: Yeah, I'm like doing the friend thing of like where I'm hugging you from behind. So we're both just kind of like walking as a unit."
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: Sofia, because you went to JFK and this sunlight is on this book in the Clinton Hill Chantry, and it's the one you remembered being here. You read a law that has to do with, paradise plays by the rules. And they don't return souls lightly because death is a part of life."
Emily: I know.
"Brennan: However, there have been numerous instances where a soul has been returned to the waking world. There had been resurrections. There have been raisings of the dead. Hell, Kingston's cast Revivify which is just a short term resurrection. But one of the things they do here, and where you find these Dale pages that you have spent weeks lovingly writing is in an area where basically they say heaven isn't stingy with souls. It's not like hell where they want to desperately cling on to souls. And in a case where either poor accounting on the part of angelic clerks would have a soul be in paradise when it shouldn't, examples are given like when a demon has stolen a soul and that soul gets liberated from the demon and brought straight to heaven. But the person that got their soul stolen never actually died in the world. Heaven of course returns those souls to the waking world right away. Obviously Dale actually was killed. So they wouldn't return a soul in that case. But if Dale had had his soul stolen by a demon and then showed up in heaven, but he had never actually died in the real waking world, of course Heaven would return his soul immediately. And as Sofia is processing what heaven's diligence about returning souls when they've made a mistake and someone actually isn't or wasn't dead, you hear some noise coming from upstairs. And Ricky, you walk in right about now as well. 'Cause you live here at the Clinton Hill Chantry. You see Sofia and Pete are downstairs."
"Ricky: Hey, guys."
(everyone laughs)
"Sofia: Hey, Ricky. I just sorta shouted at heaven about my pregnancy. So yeah."
"Ricky: Well, you know, let me know if you want me to also yell at heaven. Happy to scream at heaven as well."
"Emily: So, I mean, is there some hope in this clause? Like, what would be the..."
"Brennan: Sofia's trying to figure it out because you're basically like, okay, so heaven gives souls back, but, like, you're trying to work around right now the fact that like Isabella Infierno did murder Dale, but it doesn't seem like heaven is greedy about the souls they had. They would return Dale if you could prove that-"
Emily: If someone filed the right paperwork?
"Brennan: If you could prove that Dale was never killed by Isabella Infierno or that it was a mistake or a clerical error, they would return his soul in a heartbeat. You guys hear thunderous noise from upstairs in the Clinton Hill Chantry."
Zac: I run upstairs.
Ally: Same.
"Emily: Okay, I run upstairs."
"Brennan: You run upstairs. Ricky, your apartment's in disarray. There are lightning bolt marks on the walls. Everyone here, go ahead and give me an investigation check."
"Zac: Fuck, I got a nat one."
Brennan: Shit.
Emily: 11.
Ally: Five.
Brennan: You guys are looking around. There literally was just a struggle here.
Sofia: It's fucking Tony. Did I fuck up Esther?
Zac: Can I...
"Brennan: Sofia, you get a text on your phone from Tony saying,"
"Tony: Thanks for the heads up, kid."
"Brennan: Says,"
"Tony: I appreciate all you've done. I've had some fun doing some things of my own. I take it you guys have had a hard time finding that dragon's hoard. Sucks to be a sucker, don't it?"
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Tony: But after today, nobody's ever gonna have to worry about finding something magical ever again."
"Zac: I cast Locate Object on Esther, like Esther's, like, whatever jewelry that she might have or her staff."
Ally: I cast Haste on Ricky.
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: Have I texted people about me knowing something's going down at the Gramercy Occult Society?
Brennan: You guys get your texts from Kingston right now.
Zac: Okay.
Lou: I'm headed there immediately.
Siobhan: I will head there immediately.
Ally: I send photos of the room and what we've seen or whatever.
"Brennan: Sofia, you look down 'cause you're searching for clues. You look in the wastepaper basket of the bathroom. There is a full unopened box of Junior Mints that has some pee on it."
[beat]
Zac: What?
Emily: Can I sniff it to see if it smells like pregnant pheromones?
(everyone laughs)
"Brennan: Sofie, you don't have to sniff it. You look at a full box of Junior Mints with a little bit of pee in-"
Sofia: Esther's fuckin' pregnant?
Zac: Am I still there?
Brennan: Ricky is still there.
Ricky: What?
(everyone laughs)
"Ricky: Hold on, what?"
"Zac: I'm just like,"
Ricky: I have to go.
Sofia: I'm coming with you.
"Brennan: You're coming with. Tony sends one last text to you. Ricky, you see this on Sofie's phone. The last thing from Tony says,"
"Tony: And a sweet hello from me and your friend, Esther."
Brennan: Ricky.
Sofia: Why do I try? Why do I try to reach out to anyone?
"Zac: You know, at best we were non-entities to each other and now I really want to, I think Ricky is like ready to fuck this guy up and is going full, like, and like wants to just do something. I need a fuckin' weapon, you know?"
"Brennan: As you feel, I need a weapon. You guys hear, (Brennan mimics rustling sounds) A box in your attic shudders, raises, explodes, and coursing with lightning and radiance, Esther's baseball bat slams into your hand."
Zac: I take it and I'm off. I'm just sprinting out the door.
"Emily: Yeah, I want to try to follow him."
"Ally: Yeah, can we just ride on you? Or like what's going on?"
Zac: Probably.
"Brennan: Kingston, you take off. Are you bringing, you're bringing the egg with you, I assume?"
"Lou: Well, I mean, at this point, I'm just like pushing the stroller at full speed. And then I'm also gonna summon Alejandro."
Brennan: Hell yes. Incredible.
Lou: Ask him to fly us there with his angelic wings.
Brennan: Amazing.
Emily: I'm casting Jump on myself.
"Brennan: Yeah, as you're going, you're getting texts. You're getting texts from Nadia, Solomon, Cindy, Sofie, all saying the monastery's been attacked. It looks like Tony pulled some of Gramercy's wizards into the fold with him. He's like he stole-"
Emily: Like he flipped them?
"Brennan: Yeah, like he flipped them. Yes."
"Emily: Oh, so this was happening before. So I didn't absolutely fuck us."
Brennan: It was happening way before. Tony's been a worm for a while. He's flipped some Gramercy people. You're sprinting. Nadia says he stole some things from the monastery.
Sofia: What did he steal? Tell me what he stole. That'll give me a clue of what he's after. Obviously he's after Nod.
Nadia: A bunch of our scrolls. He stole Forms of the Greater Dreaming. He stole a bunch of other stuff.
Brennan: You see that...
Emily: I smile when I know that he stole a bunk form of the greater dreaming. (laughs)
"Brennan: You guys arrive. You guys all converge on the Gramercy Occult Society. You see Orlando and Rovias are completely stationary with banners wrapped around them saying “New York Public Library brought to you by Cypher Energy Fluid."""
Lou: God damn.
"Emily: Oh, my—"
"Brennan: You guys rush down the steps. Kingston, you summon Alejandro. Alejandro looks at you and says,"
"Alejandro: Thank goodness you summoned me. Kingston, I bring news from paradise. Dale heard what Sofia said."
Brennan: And you guys rush into the depths of the society. You hear battle breaking out.
Zac: I think Ricky is just running through the front door like the Kool-Aid man and shattering.
"Brennan: Yeah, you're like boom, through stone! JJ is there. JJ links up with you guys. He says, he looks,"
"JJ: The engine, Tony tampered with the engine!"
"Brennan: You know that JJ has been holding it down because if Tony grabbed Esther, it's broad daylight, Ana and Amelia aren't here. JJ rushes down with you. All of you begin to just descend, and you feel the umbral engine, not breaking, but being juiced. It is getting more and more powerful. Tony is getting more umbra into the city. And you realize what will happen if he does that. The thing that this has been doing to prevent regular people from seeing magic. Tony wants to jam this to 11, and every single magical thing in the city will forget that magic ever existed at all."
(cat meows)
(Ally laughs)
"Brennan: Tiny little cat meow. You guys rush the steps and see Tony and a cadre of Concrete Fist monks. He looks up and smiles and says,"
"Tony: Oh, I'm glad we get one last dance before we end this whole shit show once and for all."
"Brennan: I'm gonna need everybody here to roll initiative. And that's it for this episode of ""The Unsleeping City!"""
Emily: I got a fuckin' nat one!
Ally: Nat 20!
(Brennan laughs)
"Emily: Well, Tony, thank you for making it easy to fuckin' kill you now."

[the chill vibes of The Unsleeping City theme are here]
"[Brennan's tapping the table because, hey, things are tense]"
"Brennan: Hello one and all, and welcome to another thrilling episode of The Unsleeping City. I am your humble dungeon, Brennan Lee Mulligan, with me as always are our Intrepid Heroes. Say hi, Intrepid Heroes!"
"All: Hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"Brennan: Last we left off, it was mid December, winter in New York. Our champions-- Is that a big old Unsleeping City mug Ally just lifted up mid- recap?"
Ally: [feigning ignorance] What's that?
"Brennan: What's up? Hey, Ally, [raises a La Gran Gata mug] sláinte. You know what I mean?"
Ally: [raising their Unsleeping City mug in sync with Brennan] Hell yeah.
"Zac: Hey, Brennan, Ally. [raises and sips from a plain white mug]"
Ally: Oh.
[all laugh]
Ally: That's the… Is that a full-on bowl?
"Brennan: Yeah, part of the joke is that Ally and I both had Unsleeping City merch but the—"
Zac: The Unsleeping City trio.
[laughter]
"Brennan: Our champions of New York City were racing as fast as possible to the Gramercy Occult Society headquarters in the New York Public Library. For indeed, over the past month, the champions of New York realized an encroaching threat on the city of New York. Manifesting in Gladiator Industries, taking over the city in the waking world, manifested by an entity from beyond the depths of dreaming known as Null. This entity was confronted at Ellis Island where it captured the party's boon companion Iga Lisowski, the benefactor of the dragon. Who had birthed the egg of the new dragon of New York City, being held by Kingston Brown. Having collected all of the totems of Kugrash, the unicorn, the spicy pigeon, the juicy cockroach, And found the lost artifacts of the common world in Ellis Island. The bouquet of Marion Brown, Kingston's grandmother. Jackson Wei's baseball, a candle from the family being protected by Willie, the Golem of Williamsburg. A piece of ticker tape from the V-day parade from Alejandro Ortiz. A lucky coin, from, we never learned her name, but from Margaret McConnell, who's actually one of Pete's direct ancestors. A finger cymbal from Giancarlo Bicicleta, whose and with the eponymous bicycle in the photo. And Jackson's baseball pitched right to Cody, Jackson Wei's Mets baseball."
"Lou: Oh, the leg."
"Brennan: And Peter Stuyvesant's wooden leg from Holly Branch. You guys have all of these things, but had a devil of a time finding the hoard of the dragon of Bleecker Street. A feat that should have been easy given the arcane resources of the heroes of New York. Unless, it was being hidden from you purposefully. Unless somebody had tampered with the umbral engine in the heart of the Gramercy Occult Society. Which is exactly what you found out during, from Kingston Brown noticing there was Umbra in his own eyes, as he was unable to find the hoard. Having cracked that open, Sofia discovered a strange ray of sunlight illuminating pages of her memories of Dale Lee, that had been teleported to the Clinton Hill Chantry. Immediately after you discovered not only was Esther Sinclair gone, having been kidnapped by Tony Simos, but also our dear friend Ricky Matsui and Esther Sinclair joined to create a trio of expecting parents within the party. Gang, you have--"
Zac: Wow. It’s a very dense moment.
Emily: It was nice to have someone to do it with.
[all laugh loudly]
"Brennan: A very, dense is right. This story is heating up, and we are here at the Gramercy Occult Society where you face down Tony Simos but see Esther Sinclair nowhere. I'm gonna ask everybody to log in to Roll20 and go check this out."
Emily: I am there.
Zac: Whoa. Whoa.
Siobhan: Whoa.
Emily: Is this the Umbral engine?
"Brennan: This is the Umbral engine, and in fact, you see Tony has juiced it already. That Umbra is, you are floating in Nod. Umbra is coursing into the city [explodes] and everything else is fading away. Anyone here that wants to can make an arcana check, an insight check--"
Emily: Can we get close-up of the Tony character?
Brennan: Actually…
Lou: Yeah.
Zac: These Concrete Fist monks look like--
Siobhan: They're so buff.
"Zac: Yeah, they're just so muscular in these tiny little tokens."
Lou: They look juicy.
"Ally: It's very like Bad Boys Club, remember those?"
Zac: It's like Streets of Rage.
"Murph: Yes. Oh, there you go."
[all laugh]
Siobhan: They did not skip arm day!
Zac throws some punches.
Murph: [slowly punching] These meaty NES arms.
Emily: Do I know them? Are they people that I would actually know?
"Brennan: Sofia, you know all these people."
Emily: This is Tony?
Brennan: This is Tony right here.
Ally: Wow. What's with the beard?
"Siobhan: Oh my god, those 90’s tribal tattoos."
Zac: He looks like a guy who will help you find a pair of running shoes that really support your heel.
[all laugh]
"Emily: I know! Wait, he looks kind of nice."
Brennan: He was kind of nice at first.
Ally: No.
"Brennan: So, I'm gonna say anyone here real quick as you're approaching, give me an arcana check. If there's not enough time to try to understand all of it If you're trying to understand what's happening magically here, give me arcana. If you're trying to look at what Tony or the monks are doing, go ahead and give me insight. If you're trying to look at like what physically is happening in this space, go ahead and give me perception."
Lou: 26 perception.
Emily: Perception you said?
"Brennan: Perception is good too, yeah."
"Siobhan: I got it. Yeah, I got a 21 insight."
"Ally: Ooh, baby."
"Emily: I got 25 Perception, unless we need arcana in which case a 19 arcana."
Ally: I got 22 arcana.
Brennan: Okay.
"Emily: So 25 perception,"
"Brennan: 25 perception,"
Zac: 9 insight.
"Brennan: Cool. So we got, who rolled perceptions here? We had a 29, a 25..."
"Murph: I got a 15 perception,"
"Brennan: 15\. Awesome. Kingston and Sofie, immediately what you see is the Umbral engine, glowing brighter and spinning faster than you've ever seen it before. You can tell that your rushing here... you will probably, anyone trying to join you will have a harder and harder time because you remember back in the Holland Tunnel fight, when the readout for the umbral engine was up at about 150%? It's at about 300% right now, it is all being thrown wider and wider to pour more and more raw umbra into the city."
"Emily: With that perception check, am I seeing any kind of control panel?"
"Brennan: You guys both specifically see that you are not seeing control panel and immediately also understand that… you guys immediately also understand that there isn't a like control panel for this because the wizards are very careful with it. Like Gramercy handles this stuff magically but I think on a 25 and a 29, both of you know Tony is manipulating this somehow in a way that you guys can't see. Like something, you're immediately like you're immediately, like, there's a there's like, you're like, there's a puzzle here. Something's going on with Tony. And Sofia, you would know that these Concrete Fist monks don't have a way to tamper with this unless they're being helped by wizards."
Emily: Yeah.
Murph: But we don't see the wizards right?
Brennan: You don't see the wizards.
Emily: Wizards might be invisible.
Siobhan: I have a way to see invisibility.
"Brennan: So also Sofia, you recognize these Concrete Fist monks. These are one or two old-school monks from back in Tony's day. You would know that, you're not too.. These are tough. They're, they're skilled monks. They're nowhere near your level. And they're nowhere in your Tony's level, but they have, they some skills, right?"
"Emily: Okay. I guess I shout out to Tony,"
Sofia: This was the best you could recruit?
[laughs]
"Brennan: He looks up… there's also a couple of young kids here that are hot shots, but are clearly the people that got like bamboozled by Tony's spiel, right? Yeah. Tony calls back to you and goes… [changing his mind] or, you know, he's focusing on the Umbral engine right now. Did anyone get above a 15 on an Insight check?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I got a 21."
"Brennan: 21, Rowan, you immediately see Tony looking regretful that he gloated over text message to Sofie. Now everybody's here, but you can see on a 22 Insight, full zealot, true believer mania in his eyes. You also see his, the way his blood is pumping is like intense, his veins are like throbbing right now. And I think you also see, he, it looks like he feels like he's close to something, but you can see I think an awareness that these monks are not the only people he's working with right now."
"Emily: Can I, with my perception, would I understand anything about his ki or is what's happening nothing to do with it?"
"Brennan: You got a 20, you got a 25, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You have that memory of Tony fucking up his heart. I think on a 25 perception, Sofia, you know that Tony is going to be immune to charmed and frightened conditions. And if he fucked up his heart badly enough, he may also be immune to stunning. Like he may have changed his physiology fully and completely in his body."
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: Arcana. Who's looking at the engine?
Ally: Me.
"Brennan: Pete, JJ's research is being used here. Two things are happening simultaneously. Tony is attempting to flood so much umbra into this city, that nobody can perceive magic ever again. It will basically be...Tony doesn't understand what he's doing, but you remember talking to JJ about that quantum thing, which is basically like if nobody can perceive magic on a quantum level magic doesn't exist anymore. So Tony is just trying to complete his idea of the mission of the Concrete Fist, which is sever New York from dreams forever. You wonder, cause clearly Tony is the mastermind behind how this got tampered with and how the hoard got hidden from you. And you're like, how the fuck did Tony catch wise to that? And you see some of the stuff happened with the umbral engine, that in the way that it's been tampered with that is, I think on that, would you roll for arcana?"
"Ally: 22? 22, yeah."
"Brennan: Not only do you see the ways in which the engine has been canceled to redirect Umbra to the hoard of the dragon of Bleecker Street to hide it from you, you also see that some of the arcane tampering with it aren't arcana from Gramercy wizards. They are from, the best way you can put it is corporate magic. There is an effect here that it looks like Tony is unaware of, like Tony, you realize is chasing his zealot's dream but the schematics that he has used or perhaps been given are bringing New York minutes in on the raw umbra and flattening them. This is the thing that didn't work in the machine in Queens that Iga found, will work here. And it will potentially work here right now."
Ally: Wow.
Emily: Oh god.
Brennan: So you are fighting one villain but you're fighting two different schemes happening in this moment.
"Ally: Can I roll some sort of arcana or something to try to find the presence of Null, in this room?"
"Brennan: I'm gonna say on that 22 arcana, you know, the presence of Null. If the city is successfully flooded with raw umbra like you remember the fight at Ellis Island, Null had to retreat because A) you guys were successfully fighting it. But B) every time it was getting hurt, it was burning up more raw umbra. And you think about Nod. When Nod came to the Waking World, they were being burnt alive. When you had, when you saved them from the vampire nightclub back in season one, and you realize Null's the same way, Null can't… Null's a dream entity. They can't, Null, can't be here physically in the Waking World unless the world is so suffused with raw umbra that Null could move here openly because the world has become so divorced from magic, that it basically is void, the deep dreaming, right? So you realize Null is going to be able to show up and I'll tell you, like, you think if this thing gets to a thousand percent, if it fully gets like warp speed, Null will be able to manifest here physically, just like it did on Ellis Island."
Ally: Wow.
"Brennan: That's what you guys all see there. Tony opens his arms wide as you guys rush up, you don't see Esther. He just goes,"
"Tony: Hey, welcome to Last Dance, everybody. Thanks for joining me. Glad you could be here to witness the completion of our mission."
"Brennan: And he says this right to you, Sofie."
"Sofia: I just want to say right now, what do you want me to tell Heather Simos when I find her and I say, ""I'm sorry, Tony passed""?"
[Brennan and Murph laugh hysterically]
"Brennan: He looks at you and you see his eyes go static for a second. And something throbs in his chest. And you see, he says,"
"Tony: [growling] The fact that I restrained myself from snapping your fucking neck when you put her name in your mouth is a testament to my good graces, which are—"
"Sofia: Well, I know when I met you, you called me Sofia Bicicleta several times instead of Sofia Lee so I think we've both been butchering names that matter to each other, all right? So, you know what? I'm gonna go ahead and say, don't restrain yourself. Come snap my fucking neck."
"Brennan: [chuckles] He grimaces with a rage that lets you know he is going to take you up on that offer. Pete, kick us off, baby. You are first in the initiative order."
Lou: Woo.
Ally: Okay.
[cast members woo in the background]
Ally: I guess...
"Cody: Fucking kick his ass, Pete!"
Pete: It's all on me!
[all laugh]
Cody: This is personal for us. He was a dick to us.
"Pete: I'm gonna freak him, honey."
"Sofia: No, you guys showed everyone shoot to kill. [laughs] I'm not fucking saving this fucker. He had his chance."
"Ricky: I mean like we don't do, we want to kill these other people?"
"Sofia: No, they're.."
"Ricky: They seem like normal people, right?"
"Cody: Man, fuck this dudes."
Sofia: Tony deserves death in my opinion. [laughs] He had his redemption chance yesterday and he fucking failed.
[Brennan laughs]
Ally: I am going to run… Lemme see. Where am I going?
Zac: [laughs] You leave.
[all laugh]
Ally: [laughs] I'm gonna run.
"Brennan: “I'm scared, I'm leaving.”"
Ally: Right here.
Siobhan: Just go to a bodega… Get a pack of cigarettes.
"Brennan: Cool. Hell yeah, perfect."
"Ally: Okay. And then I'm going to… I'm gonna cast Cone of Cold, right at the machine and Tony."
"Brennan: Shit, you're gonna attack the Umbral Engine?"
Ally: I guess?
Murph: Won't it kind of like explode and kill all of us?
Brennan: I will say--
"Ally: I'm gonna use Careful Spell, and I'm gonna exclude it."
[all laugh]
Murph: Doesn’t it contain the--
"Emily: But what if that is the, what if that is...?"
"Ally: I mean that's kind of a last case scenario, is like then everyone sees magic & we just work from there."
"Brennan: I think you guys, I think Pete would recognize that destroying the machine will-- I like, I'll tell you I'm not going to, I don't wanna choose to know what will happen if you guys just break the umbral engine while it's going faster than it's ever gone. I'll probably roll a bunch of dice on some kind of wild magic table to find out. It won't be, it won't be normal if you break the machine."
[Siobhan and Murph laugh]
"Brennan: However, I fully leave that up to you. If the fight's going bad, like if the fight is going bad and it's gonna save the world?"
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, exactly. First move out the gate, I'm not going to attack."
"Murph: Just seems like, Pete, like the wizards worked really hard on it."
"Brennan: Yeah. First quarter, first down Hail Mary doesn't feel like the move right here, but let's..."
Murph: [chuckles] Just instantly.
"Zac: Our webcams all turn off, like..."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Awesome. So yeah. You're gonna go, you're gonna try to hit Tony. I think he might need to move a little bit closer to to like this corner right here to be, maybe Pete, you wanna move like right here to hit Tony in the edge of that."
Ally: Oh gotcha. Sure. Yoink.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: Cool. [high fantasy wizard voice, I guess?] One sorcery point."
[Murph and Siobhan laugh]
Ally: Okay.
Emily: Wow. Wish we'd been doing this all season… [high wizardly voice] Two sorcery points!
Ally: [high wizardly voice] Two sorcery points.
Siobhan: [wizarding] That’s a lot of sorcery points.
"Ally: Oh, sorry, I do backslash roll."
"Brennan: And actually Pete, I'm gonna need, before you do that—"
Zac: I knew it.
"Brennan: Before you do that, we're gonna do something else really quickly."
"Ally: It is a quick thing, right? Like just a little.."
Siobhan: Just a quick little...
Emily: Brennan just has an email to shoot off to someone.
[all laugh]
[crosstalk]
"Brennan: Yeah, got to do a real quick email."
"Ally: [laughs] “Hey, do you like these shoes?”"
"Siobhan: Email my accountant, there were some receipts I forgot to send them."
Zac: “Following up about that Craigslist ad…”
"Murph: Just in case there's saving throws coming up, cause I know people were doing spells just as we came in. Can I have cast on the melee? So me, Sofie and Ricky, Bless. As, like, people were doing Haste and stuff as we were coming in."
"Brennan: Ricky, I know that Ricky's got Haste. Does anyone else have concentration spells active right now? So are you, so you hit people with Bless, right Cody?"
Murph: Yeah. On the way up.
"Zac: Oh, I actually, yeah. I should bring this up cause I forgot to talk about it. At the start of the fight, I guess I still have Locate Object on… And it was at, for one of something of Esther's."
Brennan: Oh. Shit.
Emily: Ooh.
"Brennan: Yes you do. Ricky, something of Esther's is here, but not here. And that's all I can say."
Zac: Sure.
"Brennan: You sense that it's here, but not here."
Zac: She's a ghost!
[all laugh]
"Brennan: Any other… then Kingston, you have a concentration spell cause Alejandro is here correct?"
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Anyone else have any, anything concentration--"
"Emily: And I have Hexblade Curse on Tony, but that's not concentration."
"Brennan: Cool. No one else has concentration up right now. That's okay. Awesome. Pete, right now, I'm gonna tell ya. You, what you don't want, you're casting Cone of Cold. What you don't want, is a 12 or higher I'm gonna roll in front of the board."
"Zac: If I know what this is, I'm gonna Counterspell it."
"Brennan: Okay. Let me see. Let me see what 60 feet on you looks like because, well first of all, already--"
"Zac: Oh, I may not be able to Counterspell if I can't see the target."
"Brennan: However, them, let me just double check something real quick. [singing merrily] Ooh, complex, magic fight. Lots of magic going on!"
Murph: Does the engine fuck up our spells I guess?
Brennan: The engine does not fuck up your spells.
Emily: I think there's invisible wizards.
Brennan: Bam.
Emily: Does anyone have Faerie Fire?
"Siobhan: I don't, but I have See Invisibility."
"Brennan: A Gramercy wizard appears from Invisibility, slinging a Counterspell. Ricky, if that is within 60 feet you can go for it."
Zac: I think it's a little further.
Emily: It is within 60 feet of me.
[Sofia and Ricky are next to each other on the map]
"Brennan: No fucking, what are the odds? That was a totally random placement. Ricky. Okay. You cast Counterspell, right?"
Zac: Yes. Do I roll?
"Brennan: They all, no roll needed, Counterspell is a third level spell and that's the level they cast it at. So a Gramercy wizard, a traitor to the society, tries to rip that spell out of the Vox Phantasma's hands. Ricky, what do you do as they appear?"
"Zac: I think I'll like, literally baseball bat their Counterspell back at them."
[laughs hysterically]
"Brennan: Ricky, wielding a magic bat feels so good."
Zac: Hell yes.
"Brennan: Cause you realize like your old thing, used like you said as a tool. A bat isn't, a bat isn't an aggressive thing. It's a tool you can get that fucking spell right out of here."
"Zac: Not aggressive at all. I just, as I hit a Counterspell into this wizard's face."
"Brennan: Yeah… BAM! You can- you hear from the Hall of Heroes… [bugle call] Charge! Incredible. Pete, your spell goes off. Go ahead and roll damage for that Cone of Cold."
Ally: Yes. Okay. Sorry. I do backslash roll?
"Brennan: Back, yeah, slash roll."
Ally: 8d8.
"Brennan: Jesus… amazing, 38."
Siobhan: Nice.
"Brennan: I'm gonna actually, just to make sure that we are totally above board. I'm gonna see what a 60 foot aura on you would look like real quick."
Emily: Is Cone of Cold dex save? What kind of save is it?
"Brennan: Okay. So Pete, hold on one second. Cause that's what the edge of your aura would look like. So I think actually just to be clear because the arrows are a little bit screwy when you're moving diagonal. Pete, you may need to jump up on to the edge of the umbral engine to cast this spell."
"Ally: Oh, like I can't move up a little bit, like right here to move my aura."
"Brennan: Oh, shit, yes. You can move right there. That's perfect."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: So that'll get… Yes, yes, yes. Awesome. So you can see there you're gonna be able to get Tony and those first two monks just fine. So you roll damage, we're gonna roll some saves for them. I'm gonna decrease your aura again. That sounds very spiritual in a way."
[Zac laughs]
Ally: Don't try to decrease my aura.
"Emily: Sometimes you need to decrease your aura, though, to protect yourself from other people's."
Brennan: It's true. Okay.
Emily: [laughs] I was joking…
"Brennan: And these are con saves, correct?"
Zac: Absolute.
"Ally: These are con saves, honey."
Brennan: Okay.
"Emily: So just so the spellcasters know, if, with monks, if you, we have Evasion. So like if we fai… if we..."
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, if they succeed… they take no..."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: I’ll also say on Sofie's high perception check, you think that these junior monks are not, are not proficient enough to have that Eva--"
"Emily: They don't have Evasion yet. Never mind, dex away, baby."
[all laugh]
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Okay. We're gonna go, Tony makes his save, he's gonna take half damage. These dudes… However, these are Concrete Fist, so they are trained to fight magic sort of specifically. So they do have magic resistance. Okay. Oh, that's cocked, 9 plus 4 doesn't do it. Okay. So one of them takes full 38. The others are gonna take 19."
Ally: Including Tony?
"Brennan: Including Tony, Tony takes 19 cold damage as well."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Pete: Add this to your cold heart.
[Emily laughs]
"Pete: Hurt people hurt people, Tony! Can’t muscle your way through heartbreak."
[Emily and Brennan laugh]
"Sofia: No let's not categorize him as a hurt person. He's a fucking piece of shit. I reached out to him, there was nothing left."
Pete: He's just decades hurt. He's calcified.
Cody: Throw a fucking Big Gulp at him.
Murph: I throw a Big Gulp at him.
Zac: It’s whipped up into the engine.
"Pete: Dude, remember Big Gulp is Gladiator!"
"Cody: I stole it, I stole it!"
"Pete: Oh, okay, okay."
"Brennan: Hey Pete, I'm gonna need a wild magic surge. You're on 1 through 10 right now."
Murph: No!
[everyone screams]
"Ally: Oh, I’ll roll this in front of the board."
"Emily: I like them, they're cool."
"Brennan: That's a 3, baby."
"Siobhan: Okay, there we go."
Brennan: We're surgin'!
Lou: Here we go.
"Brennan: Uh Pete, go ahead and give me 2d100 rolls."
Ally: You got it. 2?.
Brennan: Yeah. Cause you can have advantage.
Siobhan: Yes. You roll with advantage.
Ally: Oh incredible. 18. 58.
"Brennan: You see, one of these is like, you feel two surges. One of them is harmless, dream frivolity. The other one is extreme danger that you might not be able to control that well."
Ally: [thinks and smiles] You know… I am gonna have to go with harmless dream frivolity. Because I'm a new guy.
[all laugh]
Zac: I know how much that hurt.
[laughs]
Ally: That hurt me a lot.
"Emily: I know how much that hurt, I think that was cool."
"Siobhan: [indistinct] Wow, Pete has changed."
"Ally: Give me the blue feathers, Brennan."
[all laugh]
"Brennan: Incredible. So what this says in the wild magic surge, is you grow a long beard made of feathers- that remains until you sneeze-"
Emily: He feather-bearded!
"Brennan: At which point, the feathers explode out from your face."
"Sofia: Pete, the testosterone salve is working."
"Pete: Oh my God, crazy. They're feathers though."
[all laugh]
"Sofia: I mean, yeah if--"
"Pete: Cody, is this a dude thing?"
[all laugh]
"Brennan: Incredible. Yeah. Pete you grow a long wizard beard of feathers, as you approach here as a sorcerer in the home of these wizards, Tony, as you do this, Tony looks at you with his beard. He's like,"
"Tony: You fucking making fun of me, dude?"
"Pete: Dude, Honestly, I just feel bad for you. You kind of remind me of my dad and I watched him get scared straight, it's really beautiful now."
[all laugh hysterically]
"Emily: I have a question, what does Pete's mustache look like with the beard? Or do the feathers?"
"Brennan: You have two small, actually the mustache is two fully functional, but small wings. There's just two little wings, flap, flap, flap."
[all laugh]
Ally moves their torso up as if floating up from the wings.
Zac: Your lip is just detaching from your gums a little bit.
Siobhan: Your top teeth are so dry.
Ally: What was the other thing? Fucking million cool fireballs go out—
Brennan: The other thing was anything you touch catches on fire.
[laughs]
"Ally: I mean... okay, we did make the right choice. That's the first round of the game, so."
"Brennan: Okay. Pete, anything else from you that turn?"
Ally: Nah.
"Brennan: Cody, that's you baby."
"Murph: Sweet. I'm going to look at this wizard and go,"
"Cody: The ninth level of hell awaits for traitors. That's right, I read a fuckin' book!"
Murph: And then I'm going to--
"Emily: [laughing] Wait, Cody read Dante's Inferno?"
Murph: He read Dante's Inferno.
Ricky: You read Dante's Inferno?
"Cody: Yeah. I needed to know about, like, Hell and shit. Cause I'm like a fucking demon."
"Lou: Go off, Cody."
"Murph: He's gonna ride at this mage. He, now at level 12, is a Mounted Combatant on his moped, so he rolls with advantage. I'm gonna do, I'm going to bonus action Thunderous Smite."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: Which I think actually does that do an area of effect? No. Okay.
[Cody’s nu metal theme starts playing]
Murph: So I'll do Thunderous Smite bonus action. And then I'm gonna do Great Weapon Master to do minus 5 to the attack roll to hope to do more.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Just taking the questing blade trying to… cut down on…
[Brennan laughs]
"Murph: That is, with Bless..."
Zac: Oh right.
Murph: That is a 16 to hit.
"Brennan: 16 to hit that Gramercy… The Gramercy traitor there, that is a hit absolutely."
"Murph: Ooo, thank God."
"Brennan: You said 17, right?"
"Murph: Yeah, no, 16 I said."
"Murph: 16? 16 is a hit, this person really regretting that Counterspell right now cause a Shield woulda come in quite handy."
[Emily and Murph laugh]
Emily: What is this person's name?
Cody: What’s your name?
Emily: How have I seen them around before?
"Cody: I know their name, it's Judas."
[all laugh]
"Emily: Okay, Judas it is."
Cody: And you live in fucking hell now. Ninth level. Good luck fucking crawling out.
"Ally: Oh my god. Guys like Cody are obsessed with Judas, yeah."
[all laugh]
Zac: Betrayal is such a huge part of this.
"Ally: Yes, huge part of it. A driving force."
"Siobhan: Hope those 30 pieces of silver was worth it, bitch."
Brennan: Incredible.
Ally: Oh my god.
"Murph: Sweet. Okay. So, okay. So 4d6 for the great, for the sword plus the Thunderous Smite and then I will do a first level smite, to do another 3d8 plus another d8, I have my greater smite thing that gives me a d8 every time plus 19, cause of Great Weapon Master."
Brennan: Um.
Murph rolls a tremendous amount of dice.
Brennan: Jesus.
[all laugh]
Murph: 50\. [screams]
Brennan: Good God.
Ally: You just drive your moped up and kill a woman?
[all laugh]
"Brennan: Up to you, If you wanna do lethal or non-lethal damage here."
Murph: Jesus Christ. Don't make me choose that. Non-lethal I guess. After I say—
[all laugh]
Emily: I think that's for the best.
Murph: Yeah.
Cody: Judas is waiting to meet you in hell.
Murph: And I just punch them so hard. [yells]
"Brennan: I mean, these people are trying to like destroy magic. These are not good people, but.."
"Ally: I mean, we can't find Esther, yeah we're all really scared."
Emily: Yeah. We might as well keep Gramercy people around in case they can tell us where Esther is and I feel we should keep these little sad monks--
"Murph: I think the wording of you just ride up on your moped and kill a woman followed by, do you wanna do lethal or non-lethal damage? Of course non-lethal damage, thank you very much."
"Brennan: Hey, I tried to help you out. I let you guys fight fucking balloons and armor all season, you know?"
"Murph: Nonlethal damage, baby. Yeah."
"Brennan: Yeah. Cody, you ride up and I honestly think, just run this woman over with your moped just. [enging noises] She of course, 50 damage, she's fucking done, dude. She's unconscious. She's toast."
Murph: Great.
Ally: Judas! [mimes driving over a bump] Kuh-kah-huhhh!
"Murph: And then… Yeah, somehow Judas is an atheist who hates Judas, I think is his deal. I am going to also, so I get a second attack but there's, I guess I have more movement ‘cause of my moped. Can I just ride up and go after this next monk here? Oh, let's see here, so this is, that's 40 feet I came down. I did about, I did about 70 feet already. I did 65, so with a dash, my warhorse can do 120."
Brennan: Yes.
Murph: So provided I can split up my movement I have enough.
"Brennan: Yes, yes, yes, yes. You can split up your movement cause it's just happening on your, on your steed."
Murph: Great. Okay. I'm just gonna keep going. Part of me just wants to like swing around and hope to hit another invisible person. But that's just so dumb right?
Ally: I mean...
"Zac: I mean, they gotta be somewhere, but I think that's, I mean the odds of it are pretty low."
"Murph: [laughs] Yeah. It's like Brennan, can I just move to a square and just swing? They need to be literally exactly on that spot. It would be so funny."
"Ally: I bet you could kill one of these like buff guys, cause one of them just took full damage from Cone of Cold."
Emily: Oh yeah.
Ally: I bet you could fully like take one out.
"Murph: I will be not a complete moron, and I will go and I will go after..."
"Brennan: The dude closest to the engine, took the most cold damage."
Murph: Got it. Okay. I'll go after this monk.
Ally: Red hair.
"Ricky: Use the sword art, Cody!"
Sofia: Tell him that he fucked over Cindy. See if he feels bad.
[Murph laughs]
"Cody: Sword art, finishing blow."
"Murph: And then I will, oh, shit Jesus. Should I do? I'm not gonna do Great Weapon Fighting cause that was, I almost missed the mage."
[Emily laughs]
"Murph: And it's a good thing I didn't. That is 13 plus 9, 22."
Ally: Hell yeah.
Brennan: 22 to hit or 22 damage?
Murph: 22 to hit.
Brennan: 22 hits. Absolutely.
Murph: Great. Okay. I will do a second level smite on this person.
"Brennan: Actually, this dude casts Shield, and you still hit."
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Cody: Nice job, you fucking idiot."
"Emily: Wait, the monk casts Shield?"
"Brennan: Yes. You see that they, some kind of Gramercy, like the wizards are helping--"
"Emily: Okay, it wasn't another Hexblade monk, okay."
Brennan: No.
"Murph: Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and roll my damage with a second level of smite. So it's 2d6 plus a second level smite with my bonus is 4d8 plus... terrible rolls. Yikes. Okay. That's still pretty good."
Brennan: How much damage is it?
Murph: 23.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. This dude is looking hurt-hurt. As you slash into that monk there, boom."
Cody: He survived Sword Art Finishing Blow? Impossible.
[all laugh]
"Brennan: Awesome. After Cody, it's gonna be Tony Simos."
Emily: I wanna see what this fucker does.
Brennan: Okay. He's gonna use 15 feet of his movement.
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: Tony strides over, is going to take his first attack. He is going to make an attack on your moped, Cody."
"Murph: Oh, I can make it hit me instead. Cause I'm a mounted combatant. So I just stick my face down."
[all laugh]
"Cody: Punch me, you fucking dick."
Brennan: He hits you. How many times can you do that?
Murph: Lemme see.
Brennan: Is there a reaction to do it?
"Murph: No, I don't believe so. I think it's just… [reads] ""Mounted Combatant: While you are mounted and aren't incapacitated you have advantage a melee rolls against unmagic creatures that are smaller than your mount. You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.”"
"Brennan: Damn, wow. Okay. Cool. So he's just gonna go after you."
"Emily: Wow Tony, off to a good start, huh?"
Murph ducks about.
"Ally: What's your AC, Cody?"
"Murph: Bad, 16."
"Ally: Eh, that sounds good."
"Brennan: Okay. He comes up, hits you for two attacks. The first attack he hits you for does… 22 points of damage."
Murph: Okay. I'm gonna Hellish Rebuke.
Brennan: Cool. And give me a concentration saving throw.
Murph: Ooh. Okay.
Brennan: That's a DC 11.
Murph: Ooh baby. Nat 19.
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: There's the rolls.
"Murph: I'm gonna Hellish Rebuke, I'm trying to think what level I should do. You know what? I'm gonna hit him with a, this is kind of crazy, but I'm gonna hit him with the third level Hellish Rebuke--"
Lou: Wow.
Murph: \--to do 4d10s.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: Hit him with ice, then hit him with fire. [laughs] This is like--"
Zac: The two dragons.
[Ally laughs]
Emily: Yeah. [laughs]
"Murph: Yeah, I'm wearing the dragon shirt. You know what actually I'm just gonna do a first level because it's, I think it's a dex save so. I know he's just gonna take half. But this is the Hellish Rebuke damage."
Ally: Hey.
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: We’ll take it.
Siobhan: We'll take it.
Murph: 12.
"Brennan: You see Tony does have Evasion. He dodges fire… as you summon that, he says,"
Tony: Fucking cut it out with that goth bullshit!
Brennan: And smacks the flames out of the…
[Siobhan laughs]
"Brennan: [chuckles] Just like, just his personal lack of playfulness and whimsy appears to be protecting him from a lot of forms of magic."
Cody: Have you even seen The Nightmare Before Christmas?
"Tony: What the fuck? Dude, I watch Death Wish every day."
Murph: [laughs] Death Wish?
"Tony: Fucking love Bronson, dude."
Ricky: You just kill people on the subway all day?
"Brennan: The second, his second attack does 23 points of damage. I'm gonna need another saving throw, or another concentration check."
"Murph: [groans] Oh my god, a nat 18."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Hell yeah.
Zac: It's hard to tell with Murph.
"Murph: Literally, the only dice I've had that have rolled well, are these red, white and blue dice that I got from a random pack."
Emily: I got those for you. I got those for you because we had just been to England for NADDPod.
"Brennan: So here's so here's the deal. Here's the deal Murph. I'm gonna need, I'm gonna need a DC 19. I'm gonna ask for three saving throws in a row. Tony is not even close to done."
Murph: Cool.
"Brennan: Give me a, I'm gonna need a strength saving throw."
"Murph: Okay. Strength is good. I'm Blessed. I might be okay. Okay, 22."
Brennan: Cool. Give me another strength saving throw.
"Murph: Okay. Oh my god. So good, 28."
[Emily and Siobhan laugh]
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Now I'm gonna need a final one. This one's only a DC 15, but this one's for the stun."
Murph: Okay. Is this dex or strength?
Brennan: This one is constitution. DC 15 constitution. To… He's attempting to stun you.
"Murph: Okay. 6, fuck! 12."
Ally: Bend Luck!
"Brennan: 12, Bend Luck? Okay. This is, is there a range on Bend Luck? Number one?"
Ally: Let's find out.
"Murph: Please Bend Luck, being stunned sucks so bad."
"Brennan: Oh, you can see. Okay. So you got a 12, so all right. Roll in front of the board. You need to hit a three or higher here."
"Cody: Come on, Pete."
Ally: You got it.
"Pete: I got you dude, cool shirt!"
Ally rolls a 1.
Zac: Fire and miss.
[all scream] Ooh!
Ally: Fucking damn it.
"Brennan: Okay, so this is not as bad as Null's stun. This isn't until the end of Tony's next turn. You… this is a more classic monk stun."
Murph: Okay.
"Brennan: But he hits you with that, with that. So you were stunned until the end of Tony's next turn. You also feels he stuns you, I'm gonna say Sofia or Pete, make perception checks here for me with Tony's stun."
Ally: Absolutely.
"Emily: Okay. That is, hold on. I gotta go back to perception. That is a 15."
"Brennan: 15\. Cool. Pete, did you get a 15? Nope. Are you muted Ally?"
Ally: [barely audible] That's a nat one.
"Brennan: Pete, you have no idea what the fuck is going on. Sofia, you see something in Tony's stunning attack. The ways he's protected himself with his, the way he fucked up his heart, ki doesn't flow through him normally anymore. You can tell that there's something wrong with his stunning technique. Cody did not have a way to overcome it but you feel that there might be a way for other people here in the party to deal with Tony's stunning strikes ‘cause you see he didn't spend ki to do that stunning strike which makes you think that it would be possible for someone to potentially spend ki to resist it."
"Emily: Oh. Does that look like someone could Dispel Magic on it or something? Or it's much more of like a, oh it's bad ki."
"Brennan: It looks like it's bad, you think that someone with ki could potentially resist Tony's stunning strikes. However, the stunning could be done away with with like a Lesser Restoration, but that's someone taking their whole turn to give Cody his whole turn."
"Emily: Yeah, okay, cool. [laughs]"
"Murph: Not to tell on myself, but does Bless break? Does stun break concentration? I don't know if it does."
Brennan: Let me look that up real quick.
"Emily: I don't know that it does, ‘cause you can still, you can still speak falteringly."
[Murph laughs]
"Siobhan: Your brain is still working, your body just isn't."
"Emily: You're just, you're Blessed, you're Blessed."
Brennan: Anything that makes you incapacitated will end concentration.
"Emily: Okay, I think stun is incapacitated."
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. Let's just double check that real quick so we're being as diligent as possible. Stunned is incapacitated. Bless is gone."
Emily: But you got to use it to make some strength saves. So that's worth it.
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
Murph: I might've been knocked out if it was really bad.
"Zac: Yeah, he could've ripped you in half."
[all laugh]
Ally: Like a phone book.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Tony, Tony has 70 feet of movement. Let's see if he can make it to Pete."
"Zac: Hold on, how many turns does Tony have? God damn."
Siobhan: Monks just keep going.
"Emily: Well, no, he's doing stuff that Sofia can't do."
"Zac: He’s made like six attacks. And then, he's going to move 70 feet and then maybe attack again."
Siobhan: Maybe he has like Haste cast on him.
Zac: Yeah.
"Emily: Ooh, yeah."
"Brennan: You guys, Tony is, you guys know Tony is a legendary opponent. He closes with Pete, is gonna make his last two attacks on Pete."
Zac: He has eight attacks?
Brennan: Four attacks.
Zac: Four? How did I get eight?
"Murph: Yeah, I only got hit twice."
Lou: Tony Simos has 15 attacks?
Brennan: 15?
"Zac: He's gonna close on Pete, take 9 more attacks."
"Sofia: I just want you to know every hit you make, I'm not gonna tell Heather Simos about. She's gonna think you died a coward not having landed a single hit."
Rowan: Just shit yourself in front of everybody.
"Brennan: Pete, you are hit twice by Tony."
"Ally: Damn, used my reaction."
"Brennan: Yes, that's right. Tony hits you twice and he is going to...first attack deals… 7, 2, 9… deals 19 damage. Give me a DC 10 concentration check."
Ally: 19.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Next one deals 16 damage. Go ahead and give me a DC 10 concentration check.
Ally: So that was 10 and 16?
Brennan: Yep.
"Ally: Ooh, that's only a nine."
Brennan: You lose Haste.
"Ally: Oh wait, no, no, sorry. What do I add to that?"
Brennan: Whatever your...
Zac: ...con saving throw is?
Brennan: Con saving throw is. You got a +6.
"Ally: Oh, we got it. Okay, yeah."
Emily: Ooh yeah.
"Lou: Oooh, my heart."
"Ally: Yeah, sorry."
"Murph: Doesn't after you lose Haste, doesn't the person lose a turn?"
"Siobhan: Yes, they do."
Brennan: Yeah. Absolutely.
Zac: But he didn't lose it right?
Brennan: Did not lose it.
"Siobhan: No, he didn't."
[suspenseful music]
"Brennan: Okay, now I'm gonna need, let's go ahead and do that. Let's go ahead and do that, I'm gonna need three Constitution saving throws in a row from Pete."
Siobhan: Counterspell.
Brennan: They're not spells.
"Siobhan: Oh no, this is stunning."
Brennan: It's stunning and two other effects that Tony's got planned for Pete.
"Ally: So I have plus 6, to these rolls."
Brennan: You have plus 6 to these rolls.
"Ally: Yeah, that's right, bitch. 23."
Brennan: You avoid the stun.
Ally: 21.
Murph: Nice.
Brennan: You avoid the next thing.
"Ally: Oh, 9."
"Brennan: Pete, you rush up. Tony, bam! Bam! Is just laying into you and goes,"
"Ally: I'm like,"
"Cody: Hey man, the first two people you attacked in his fight were a moped and a guy with a feather beard. You fucking coward."
[all laugh]
"Brennan: You see, he looks at you and says"
Tony: I know what you fucking are.
"Pete: You the kind of guy who only attacks people you think you can beat, you're so fucking sad."
"Sofia: Yeah, it's kind of pathetic you didn't come after me."
Pete: Yeah. You have a clear number one rival here.
"Brennan: Pete, as you were fighting, throwing magic up. Tony leans in grabs the back of your neck with his left hand--"
Ally: I kiss him.
"Brennan: Right after you kiss him, he crushes your wind pipe with an elbow strike."
Pete: Oh no.
"Brennan: You are, Pete, he damages your ability to, you cannot create the verbal components of spells right now. He has special Concrete Fist techniques for spellcasters. He removes your ability to create the verbal components of spellcasting. That's the end of Tony's turn. Ricky. That is you."
Zac: Is… is Haste still up? Did that stop his-? [touches his throat]
"Brennan: Haste is still up. Yeah. You see he's just, he was like,"
"Tony: Yeah, Keep talking shit."
Brennan: And you see this like elbow strike into your throat.
"Ally: I have Subtle Spell. You sad, sad man."
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: [loudly gasps] Oh, shit, wait, you took Subtle Spell?"
"Ally: Didn't change shit. As I'm being crushed, I pull a copy of the Artist's Way out of my pocket and I slip it into his jacket and I go"
Pete: [weakly] Take the silverware too.
"Brennan: Ricky, that's you. Oh my god. I thought I had this cool mechanic to be scary and Pete is unstoppable."
Ally sticks their tongue out and mugs for the camera.
Zac: Jesus. I— Ricky's gonna use Ox's movement to get up in the mix.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Zac: I mean, I don't really have to but I think it might as well, to get here."
Ally: That's right baby.
"Zac: And I'm just freaking um, trying to, fucking home run derby over here."
[all laugh]
"Cody: Omni-bat Ricky, Omni-bat!"
Ricky: Hell yes. What's an Omni-bat?
"Murph: It’s like Omnislash, but with a bat!"
Ricky: Okay.
Zac: And I get...with Haste I get an extra attack or an extra round? Like...
Brennan: You get an extra attack.
Zac: So I'm gonna take three attacks--
Brennan: Jesus.
"Zac: \--on him. First attack… Does a 12 hit? No, probably not. Second attack, does a nat one hit?"
Emily: Oh no.
Murph: Dude. Brutal.
"Emily: Hey, I've been there Ricky, I've been there, you know."
"Lou: We got one more, we've got one more."
"Zac: Does a 21 hit? I'm sorry, 22 hit?"
"Brennan: Zac, 22 exactly hits."
Lou: Fuck.
Ally: Hell yeah.
Zac: Okay. Yeah. Third level divine smite.
Murph: Nice.
"Zac: And wait, I can stack smites too, right?"
"Brennan: If you do, did you cast a bonus action smite this turn?"
"Zac: No. ‘Cause I haven't hit. Oh, do I have to cast before I hit?"
"Brennan: You have to cast it before. I'll let you throw it on there if you want to. But in general, you have to cast it before."
"Zac: You know what, weirdly I don't have it in my, I think I accidentally forgot to prepare that."
[Emily laughs loudly]
Murph: Do you have Thunderous Smite or anything?
"Zac: No, I have Branding Smite but I don't have it on my spell list I realize, well, I fucked up. Okay, well let's just do a third level Divine Smite. And then, so that's how many d8 is that?"
Brennan: It's going to be 4d8 plus 1d6. Lightning damage.
"Zac: Oh yeah. 4d8 plus 1d6, and that's including improved divine smite or no?"
"Brennan: Oh no, that should be, if you're doing a third. You're doing a third level divine smite? That's already 4d8, so it should be 6d8 plus 1d6."
"Zac: 6d8 plus 1d6, okay."
Brennan: 6d8 plus 1d6 plus...
"Zac: Sorry, I'm gonna do it in front of the board. Plus 1d6, umm, yeah."
"Brennan: Wait a minute. Yeah, hold on. This should be, yeah, it's plus seven at the end. So 6d8 plus one D6 plus seven."
"Zac: Okay. All right. Not amazing. 6d8, so that's 27 damage. Damn, those are low rolls and I'm gonna push him five feet into the engine."
[chuckles]
Brennan: Hell yeah. Awesome. You push him. Let me just double check. Does he get any save as to that?
"Zac: Well, let me double check. “Once per turn when you hit a creature with your attack deals bludgeoning damage, you can push them five feet.” I won't, I mean like if that feels like--"
Brennan: I think this is UA right now. I'm gonna give him a strength save because the fact that you can do that on every single attack is pretty--
"Zac: You can't, it's only once per turn."
"Brennan: Oh, it’s only once per turn, okay, cool. I'm gonna give him a strength save. Your DC here is 16. I will roll in front of the board. He's really got to make this, but he does have a high, his saves are bananas. So he just needs a four or higher here. If he rolls a 1-3, he's in a lot of trouble. 18\. Okay. But you crack into him. How much damage does that again? You did 27 damage?"
Zac: 27 damage.
Brennan: Okay.
Zac: Not the best rolls over here.
Brennan: Yeah. That's gonna be...
Emily: I've been there.
"Brennan: Uh, hell yeah. Huah! Into the side of him. Ricky, at the end of your turn, you see he calls back. He just says,"
Tony: Keep juicing it!
Brennan: And does something on his legendary action to bolster all of his allies.
"Emily: [sighs] With that perception check, do I get like earlier, do I get the sense that they need line of sight on this machine?"
Brennan: You do get the sense that they need some kind of line of sight on this machine.
"Zac: Oh, can Ox take his attack? [laughs]"
Brennan: Yeah.
Emily: Yeah! Dalmatian go after Tony!
"Zac: Pack Tactics, baby. He rolled like 18. He's not going to hit Tony."
"Brennan: Cool. That's going to now be… Buh-buh-buhmm… JJ looks over at Kingston and Sofia who are still with him. He's got a spell ready to cast on somebody and he goes,"
JJ: Who needs protection?
"Sofia: Ah, give it to Kingston."
Kingston: Are you sure? You're about to go toe to toe.
Rowan: You’re about to...
"Sofia: Yeah, but I'm cool with a little damage, remember? And you're our healer."
Kingston: You heard the lady.
"Brennan: JJ steps forward and… grabs on this Umbra, spins Umbral arcana in a protective shield around Kingston. Kingston, you have the Blur spell active on you."
Lou: Okay.
"Sofia: Wow, Kingston this is trippy."
"Kingston: Yeah. JJ, what the hell did you do to me?"
"JJ: Kingston, it’s just that you're hard to see, people will have a hard time and so they won't be able to really hit you as well."
Kingston: Okay.
Brennan: People have disadvantage on attack rolls against Kingston.
Lou: Sick.
Emily: Amazing.
Brennan: Awesome.
"Lou: There you go JJ, there you go, JJ."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. That's going to now be Rowan, that's your turn."
"Siobhan: Pete, are there any spells that you can do without verbal?"
"Emily: Yeah, Subtle Spell."
"Ally: Oh, I can use sorcery points and still cast spells."
"Siobhan: Oh, great. Okay. So it seems like Tony's pretty immune to magic, right? He seems to have some kind of immunity against magic."
"Brennan: He has, all of his training is in fighting extraplanar and magical beings, yeah."
"Siobhan: Sick. Oh, does using my Mirror of Manannan to See Invisibility, is that an object interaction?"
"Brennan: No, that's casting a spell."
Siobhan: Okay. Well then I will do that so that we know where all of these dang wizards are.
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Oh, baby. Hold on one second."
Ally: This is gonna be insane.
"Brennan: Might not be as insane as you imagined. Rowan, you, so you're right there right? Oh, but the walls are all gone. Cause you're in trippy land. So that doesn't actually matter too much."
"Siobhan: And there's no range on it, I can just see them."
Brennan: Rowan… blam. 3 wizards appear on the various staircases around you as you cast See Invisibility.
Siobhan: Great. And does it count as me casting that or does that count as the mirror casting that?
Brennan: You cast it using the magic item.
"Siobhan: Mm. Okay. So I can't use a bonus action spell. Interesting. Interesting. Then I will cast Vicious Mockery on our boy, Tony Simos. And I'll say,"
Rowan: Those tribal tattoos are derivative.
[Brennan laughs]
"Siobhan: And it's, so it's just.."
Brennan: He succeeds on his Wisdom save to resist that spell.
Siobhan: Oh damn. Well
Brennan: Also I think Vicious Mockery is an action. Casting time is one action.
"Siobhan: Yeah. Well, I, what do I do? I guess I move towards where..."
"Brennan: Your bonus actions are Misty Step, Blinding Smite or Bardic Inspiration."
"Siobhan: Oh, I can.. [laughs] I haven’t played this character in a while. I can give people Bardic inspiration."
"Rowan: Sofie, I can't wait to see you absolutely just destroy this man in the most revolting and humiliating way possible."
Siobhan: And you have bardic inspiration.
"Sofia: Rowan, thank you so much. And if we have time after this I'd love to go pantsuit shopping."
Rowan: Oh my goodness. What a delight. What a joy.
Siobhan: And it's a d10 Bardic Inspiration.
Ally: Oooh!
Emily: Yeah.
Ally: Holy shit.
"Brennan: Incredible, Kingston, that is your turn."
"Lou: Can I turn to Alejandro and just be like,"
"Kingston: Well, how are they juicing this?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Alejandro says,"
Alejandro: Announcing this to all of the Gramercy traitor wizards here in this room. So deeply disappointed. You were around when I was still here. So I don't know why this..
"Brennan: You see Alejandro looks and says,"
"Alejandro: They are casting Dispel Magic into the Umbral engine. They are removing the, we had restraints because we knew this was a possibility. So they are dispelling the wards on the inside of the engine. We have to stop them from doing this."
"Emily: Now that we see them, will we be able to see-- Oh wait, but they're too far away."
"Brennan: Only Rowan can see them. So Rowan has called out where they are. Cool. So like, you guys will still need to hit high perception checks to be able to, even if Rowan's like, “There's one on the middle of the staircase.”"
"Emily: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Brennan: Cool. But that's what Alejandro says that the wizards are casting dispels on the engine.
Ally: Incredible.
"Lou: Great. I look at Sofie and I'm like,"
Kingston: You go kick his ass. We’ll go figure these wizards--
"Sofia: Okay, I can also go stun wizards or something."
"Kingston: Hey, your choice. Me and Alejandro, we'll go drive, fuck some shit up."
Sofia: [laughing] Okay.
Lou: And I think me and Alejandro will take off to the right side.
"Brennan: Actually. You know what Kingston? Alejandro is going to take a full dash, pick you up and fly you over there."
Lou: Wow. Look at that.
[group cheers]
"Brennan: So that's... Alejandro can get 80 feet. So, picks you up."
Zac: [laughs] Like carrying you through the threshold.
Kingston: I hate this. Ricky was trying to get me to go on his shoulders earlier. I do not like being picked up. All right? I'm a grown man. I have two feet. I like to use them.
"Brennan: You see Alejandro is just going like,"
"Alejandro: Don't you see how strong I am now? It's incredible! This body is made up of celestial. Let me have some fun! You're a big guy, I never get to pick you up when—"
"Kingston: Put me down! Okay, okay fine. Oh, you had your fun, now drop me."
"Lou: And I'm gonna cast, fuck it I'm gonna cast True Seeing on myself."
Ally: Hell yeah.
[cast oohs]
"Lou: Hey, go burn my sixth level spell but I could see these fucking wizards, but yeah we'll fly over there and I think that's, I think that's my turn."
"Brennan: Cool. Hell yeah. That's going to be, That's gonna be these Concrete Fist monks. Let's see here."
Lou measures the distance between Kingston and a monk.
"Lou: It's 31.8, you know? So I don't know if it's--"
Ally: So that's with disadvantage if I've ever seen it.
"Lou: Yeah, exactly."
Siobhan: Sure seems like disadvantage to me.
Ally: A whole foot point eight?
Lou: Yeah.
"Kingston: Yo, Alejandro, don't drop me yet. Let's stay up in the air. Stay up in the air. I'm sorry. I was joking. I was joking. Please don't put me down."
[group laughs]
"Brennan: Oh, incredible. Kingston's armor class is 18."
"Emily: Isn't it buffed though, because, oh, but you're blurred."
"Brennan: Yeah, they have disadvantage on all of these. That's a miss, would have been a nat 20. That is still a hit."
Lou: Okay.
"Brennan: Miss… ...bare miss. That's a hit… ...and a miss. Two of them hit. Kingston you take 4, 10. You take 22 points of damage, need two DC 10 concentration saving throws."
"Emily: From what I can tell though, those are probably for stun, but from what I can tell, True Seeing is not concentration. So you wouldn't lose it right? If you became stunned."
"Lou: True seeing I'm good. It's about keeping Alejandro in the mix. But wait are these, these are to hold my spell, right?"
Brennan: Yes will hold your spell.
"Lou: Okay, Great. First one, first one… it's DC 10?"
Brennan: DC 10.
"Lou: First one, pass. Don't even need advantage yet. Second one, plus 7...11."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you're good."
Lou: We’re good.
"Kingston: Alejandro, you ain't done yet."
"Alejandro: Please, Kingston, I know it can be hard for you. Not the toughest guy in the world, but try to hold onto this spell to keep me around."
"Kingston: All right. I'm pretty tough, all right. I don't know why everyone's trying to act like I can't scrap. All right. We gon’ scrap."
"Alejandro: You are the one who is three years older, I stopped aging, so."
"Kingston: Do not, do not right now."
[all laugh]
Brennan: Alejandro's so happy to be with Kingston again. These other monks are gonna wail on Cody's ass hard.
[Murph laughs]
"Cody: Oh God, this is high school all over again."
[Emily and Siobhan laugh]
"Brennan: And they are all, unlike Kingston, they are all rolling with advantage."
Zac: Oh no.
"Murph: Cody’s like,"
Cody: Check out my new moped.
"Emily: Oh, cause you’re stunned."
"Zac: Cody, are you okay? What’s--?"
Murph: Yeah. We'll see. I've taken a lot of damage already. I'm at 55.
Brennan: Hits… Miss...
"Murph: Miss? Wow, incredible."
"Brennan: Two hits, a crit…"
[cast groans]
"Ally: Oh, okay, those you were quiet about."
Brennan: Three hits and a crit. You don't have concentration or anything right?
"Murph: No, I'm absolutely stunned."
Brennan: So that's gonna be..
"Murph: Stunned thinking about whether or not Cody would like Death Wish, he's grappling with himself."
Zac: It just feels old.
[all laugh]
Murph: Yeah.
Zac: It's too old.
Murph: He doesn't wanna connect with Tony in any way.
"Brennan: And we're gonna roll this in front of the board, Cody. It's gonna be 10d6 plus..."
Murph: No!
Brennan: 16.
Zac: [in disbelief] 10d6 plus 16?
Murph: You fucking absolutely hate to see it.
Brennan: 53 damage.
Murph: Oh! I'm still up. I’m still up!
[Emily laughs]
"Murph: Barely, good lord!"
"Sofia: Cody, you deserve it at this point.. I feel like you're still up because of the work you've done on yourself."
Brennan: Yeah. A stunned Cody. These dudes just fucking are wailing on like a Cody with his bell rung. [mimics impacts]
"Ally: I mean, can your moped take damage for you? Or are you just kind of in an uneven relationship with it?"
Murph: I'm just happy they haven't touched my moped.
"Brennan: Sofia, that is--"
Ally: It just sparkles.
"Brennan: Sofia, that's gonna be you."
"Emily: That's me. Okay. So I've got Bardic but I'm not Blessed. I know that I've got this like idea to use Darkness to hide the Umbral engine in the, in my back pocket. But I just, I spent the entire last fight stunned. I would like to fight someone."
"Brennan: Also Darkness is 20 feet, right?"
Emily: Darkness is a 15 foot radius.
"Brennan: So 15 foot radius. So you would not, you'd be able to cover a large amount of the Umbral engine?"
"Siobhan: Radius, 60 foot diameter."
"Emily: No, 15 foot radius. So 30 foot diameter."
"Brennan: 15 foot radius. Cool. So, Sofia go for it."
"Emily: Okay. Yeah. I'm just gonna run up to Tony and let's do this, I won't be using any Stunning Strikes on him, but wait, where is he? Yeah, I'm just gonna throw myself in the mix. He's got a Hexblade Curse on him. You know, I'm hoping for the gods to be good to me. [rolls] Oh my god. My first roll was a 3."
Brennan: Oh no.
"Emily: Let us see a three, 12 with a Bardic. I would need to roll a 10. Okay. Miss with my first one, a 4."
Brennan: Oh God.
"Emily: I'm not going to use that. I'm not going to use Bardic yet. Cause I don't think that would necessarily hit. Okay, 18. I'm going to Flurry of Blows. Unfortunately these are my regular attacks. So that's 8 plus 4, 12. And then one final one, which is a 10 plus 9. I will use my Bardic for that. Okay. That's going to hit and a seven plus, 7 plus a 4...plus 4, 11. So 11 and 12. Sofia feels like fucking shit."
[all laugh]
"Emily: Yeah. Pretty much since I've been pregnant, my life sucks."
"Brennan: I will say Sofia, you did move Tony to having taken 69 points of damage exactly. So that's fun."
Ally: Nice.
Emily: You know it doesn't cheer Sofia up.
"Brennan: Okay. That, Sofia rushes in, starts to combat Tony. At the end of Tony's turn, he's gonna take another legendary action to, he's gonna take another legendary action to make a just an unarmed strike against Sofia."
Emily: I'm not even gonna Shield because I want the damage.
"Brennan: That's a hit. I'm gonna need, but he doesn't. The stunning effect does not happen yet. Go ahead. But he's going to deal you. Ooh, 14, 24 points of damage. He deals 24 points of damage to you and I'm gonna need a strength saving throw."
Emily: The strength saving throw. Okay. Hm. What low number will I roll today?
[Ally laughs]
"Zac: Sofia, let's… [chuckles]"
"Emily: Okay, a 21."
"Brennan: Cool. You are not knocked prone. He goes for the legs, you leap over it. He hits you for that damage. It is gonna be Pete's turn again."
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: Oh, sorry, sorry. I almost skipped past some other people I should really not have skipped past, which are the fucking wizards themselves. You guys see upper left, this wizard, hits the umbral arc… sorry. Actually, this wizard upper right, hits the engine with a Dispel Magic. It goes-"
Siobhan: Counterspell!
Brennan: Way past 60 feet from you.
Siobhan: Dang. Oh it's this one over here.
Brennan: Upper right. Yeah.
Emily: Can we say that I actually used my... oh no.
"Brennan: Actually you know what, It is the one on the upper left hand side. So upper left hand...."
Siobhan: No. It's still too far.
"Brennan: Still too far, does it--"
"Emily: Can I have used the rest of my movement? Although I guess no, I couldn't, whatever."
"Brennan: So hits the, the Umbral engine..."
Umbral Engine: [pleasant computer voice] 450%.
Brennan: You see... Kingston. I am going to need a Charisma saving throw from you. I'm gonna need a DC 14 Charisma saving throw.
"Lou: Whoa, baby. 15."
"Brennan: [laughs, impressed] The wizard on the lower right, attempts to Banish you. You resist that."
Kingston: I don't leave New York.
[all laugh]
"Brennan: Incredible. And this other one, okay. Is gonna make some attacks on Cody with advantage, three different attacks."
Ally: Whoa.
"Brennan: Scorching Ray. That's gonna be, that's a hit."
"Emily: Wait, who's-? Oh, the one up there."
"Brennan: Upper right, miss on the second ray, hit on the next one. One, two, three… Cod-"
"Murph: I'm down, I'm down no matter what. I'm at two."
"Brennan: Cool. Cody, you hit the deck. You hit the deck at zero making death saves. Those are those Gramercies there. That's going to go to the top. Pete, that's you."
"Ally: Okay. So I would like to, I'm like,"
[Pete makes choking noises]
"Ally: And then I want to look at Tony and pretend like I'm realizing I can't use any of my spells, like,"
[Pete continues choking with a startled expression]
"Ally: And then look up at him and go,"
Pete smiles and holds a finger to his mouth.
"Ally: And cast a let's see, we'll do fifth level Fireball on that wizard up in the corner. So since it's like a 20 foot radius I think I should be able to hit them without any like disadvantage or anything. Cause it's that whole area."
"Brennan: Yeah. Where are you hitting them? You're hitting them, which one, sorry?"
Ally: The one in the top left. Top left. It's a 20 foot radius sphere.
"Brennan: Are you doing, are you doing Fireball on them?"
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll damage. I think it's 10d6 fire damage.
[someone whistles]
"Ally: 30, 9d6."
"Brennan: Oh, 9d6. Okay."
"Ally: So that's my sassy little moment where I'm like, Oh no. And then I'm like, [grins and puts a finger to their lips] Fireball shoots out from me to one of his little wizards."
"Brennan: Past 60 feet, can't counter, takes 30. That wizard is looking badly hurt. And Pete yeah, you don't need your, you see Tony looks horrified, that his like anti-magic shit does not seem to affect you in any meaningful way."
"Ally: And then I'm going to take a little dash? I mean not a dash, sorry, but I am just gonna run towards Cody."
Brennan: Go for it.
[Ally makes a cool noise]
"Brennan: As you leave, Tony's gonna take an attack of opportunity on you. Hits."
Ally: Shield.
Brennan: Still hits and deals you—
"Ally: Oh wait, hold on. Okay, Yeah. Whatever."
"Brennan: Deals you 20 points of damage. Deals you 20 points of damage and hold on. And I'm going to need a, I'm gonna need a dex saving throw from Pete."
Ally: Nat 20.
Murph: Nice.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you dodge, end of Pete's turn. He's gonna take another attack, hits Sofia and deals Sofia 20 points of damage as well. Also—"
"Emily: Cool. I might as well, what're you gonna say?"
"Brennan: Give me a strength saving throw, and a con saving throw."
"Emily: Okay. Strength save. Oh boy, I think that's gonna save. Strength save, that's gonna be a 20."
Brennan: You do not go prone again. Give me that con save.
"Emily: Con save is definitely gonna fucking save. That's a... Oh, okay, that's just 20."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You are good on both counts. Cody, I'm gonna need a death saving throw."
"Murph: Yeah, I'll roll it in front of the table."
"Zac: Come on, Cody."
"Siobhan: Come on, Cody."
Murph rolls a 17.
"Siobhan: Yes, Cody."
Murph: Nice.
"Zac: Yes, Cody."
Ally: Hell yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: This is, one time Cody at the mall threw a Big Gulp at the dudes at Modell's who had bullied him at the Hot Topic. And then they kicked his ass in the parking lot near mopeds. Cody's getting flashbacks. This is nothing out of the ordinary."
"Ally: They beat you with those little like weird wire mixing balls from their, like, protein shakes."
[Murph laughs]
"Ally: Just like, [makes a metal clanging noise]."
"Brennan: That's gonna be Tony, Tony is gonna go in four attacks on Sofia."
"Ally: Well, that's gonna be Tony? It's finally his turn?"
"Brennan: [laughs] Oh God, everyone's got some fucking shit to say, huh?"
[Ally laughs]
"Zac: He's got 15 attacks, and they're going in on Sofia right now."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Lou: Tony will now take his 15 attacks. If everyone in 120 foot radius can make a chaos throw, a chaos saving throw."
[Ally and Murph laugh]
Brennan: Sofia's AC is 19 right?
Emily: Yep. Let me know one by one because I might take one attack and then cast Shield.
"Brennan: Okay. That's a miss on the first attack. Ah, incredible. Hold on. That was cocked. That's a hit."
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: That's it. That's a hit.
Emily: Okay. I cast Shield after the first hit.
"Brennan: After the first, okay. He rolled a 9. Yours is 24. He misses on his third attack. La Gran Gata swirls around. He says,"
Tony: Get that fucking cat out of here!
"Sofia: Thank you for the damage. Now I'm gonna do radiant, extra radiant damage. And I really appreciate that, Tony."
Brennan: Incredible. He hits you twice.
Emily: Even with the Shield after that?
"Brennan: Oh, no. The two out of four attacks on his turn hit you."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: So he, that's gonna be 10, 14. He deals 34 points of damage to Sofia. Boom, boom, boom! You've still got Shield active. Oof, Tony, you should have imposed the no reactions thing instead of that prone thing, buddy."
"Zac: I'll take a, one of my, one of those attacks. Would you like to not be hit by one of those Sofia?"
"Emily: Yeah, that's fine with me. I only needed 6 damage to get down to radiant damage."
"Zac: Okay, the one that was 14 damage, the second one, I guess? Could I take that hit from my Aura of Guardian?"
"Brennan: Oh, sure. You wanna take the second one?"
"Zac: Yeah. So I'll just take the damage of that. I don't take any… the status stuff still happens, but--"
"Brennan: Sofia, you take 20. Ricky, you take 14 points of damage. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Oh, Pete? Did you get hit by that opportunity attack or no? No, you did not."
"Ally: I did. Yeah, I did."
Brennan: Give me a concentration check for Haste. Yeah.
Ally: Oh yeah. That's 18.
"Brennan: Cool. Good, good, good."
"Ally: I keep forgetting what my, I really can't find where it says plus 6 about this, but I do believe you."
"Zac: On D&D Beyond, there should be on, like top left under your stats."
Ally: Ohh!
Zac: Saving throws.
"Brennan: Sofia, go ahead, give me a dex saving throw."
Emily: Okay. Yeah. That's gonna be good. That's a 22.
Brennan: Give me another dex saving throw and then a con saving throw.
Emily: Why three? Oh. Cause he's using multiple ki points.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: Only 13 for the second dex and then 19 for the con. Oh wait. No, no, no no. 17 for the con."
"Brennan: Cool. You are not stunned. You do go prone, he, bam! Moves you to the ground. Ricky, that's gonna be your turn."
"Ally: Oh. And with Haste, your added action can be an attack or a disengage or a object interaction. It's just like an extra."
"Zac: Oh, okay. It's just like a physical thing? Yeah. Okay. Let's see. Ox is just gonna get in there. Like, might as well, Pack Tactics. My buddy is gonna do, he's not gonna hit cause it's 22 is the AC, right?"
Brennan: Uh-huh.
Zac: Okay. Now Ricky is gonna take his attacks. First attack… Does… a 20 hit?
Brennan: 20 does not hit.
"Zac: Second attack 19 on the dice, so that will hit."
Murph: Nice.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, and you're adding because, for some reason your weapon in your thing, doesn't look right to me. I just wanna make sure that you have the correct thing here cause you should be adding plus 11 to these attacks."
"Zac: Oh, shit. I think I still have the like Defender kind of a fighting style rather than the Dueling fighting style."
"Brennan: Yeah. Ricky, you should be adding plus 11 to your attacks."
"Zac: Okay. Wait, so I rolled an 11 on the first one then."
Ally: That’s exactly it.
Murph: That’s exactly it.
"Zac: So that's 22 twice then. Okay. Yeah. And then my third attack, 16 on the dice. So three hits."
Lou: Woo!
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Murph: Dude, just smite his ass."
"Zac: I'm going to, I wanna save one. I've used two third level spell slots already. So I'm gonna save one just in case, I'm gonna, do one first level smite and two second level smites. I'm gonna smite three times."
Brennan: Jesus.
Zac: I think. Is that crazy?
Brennan: So that's gonna be...
Murph: No dude. Go for it.
Brennan: So that's going to be...
Zac: Cause each one gets an improved divine smite as well.
"Brennan: So just your attacks with improved divine smite is 6d8 which becomes 8d8 on the first divine smite, 10d8… And then your second level bumps that to 13d8. That's 13d8 plus 21."
Zac: Plus the d6 of lightning damage right?
Brennan: Each time. So that's 13d8 plus 3d6 plus 21.
Lou: Whoa…
Siobhan: Jesus Christ.
Ally: FINALLY!
Brennan: 3d8 plus 21.
Ally: Incredible.
Lou: Damn.
"Zac: 3d6 though, 3d6?"
"Brennan: Six, yeah. 13d8 plus 3d6 plus 21."
Zac: Okay.
"Ricky: Tony… Get fucked, dude."
[all laugh]
Kingston: Did Ricky say 'fuck?'
Rowan: [gasps] That’s pretty rude.
Ricky: [puts a hand over his mouth] I don’t usually curse.
Murph: I can't believe Cody was out and missed that.
Zac: 90...
Siobhan: Wowwwww...
"Brennan: Jesus fucking Christ. Tony is a legendary opponent. Ricky, as he slams Sofia into the ground and stands back up, it's [baseball bat crack] once across the jaw, once across the head, and [baseball bat crack] slam into the stomach crackling with lightning and radiance. Tony hasn't looked hurt this whole time. Tony looks hurt. Tony looks hurt."
Ally: Hell yeah.
Zac: Can I try to push him five feet away?
"Brennan: Yes. I'm gonna go ahead and make this again. He, again, if he gets a 3 or lower, it is fucking bad. 9, he's okay. Uh, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Laying into him, at the end of your turn… He's gonna start focusing on Ricky now. That's what he's, that's what he's gonna do."
"Emily: Yeah, that’s fine."
"Brennan: Oh, he's gonna go for Ricky. Misses, and wastes a legendary action doing so. Incredible. That's going to be JJ. JJ's gonna go ahead and hit one of the people attacking Kingston or actually no, he's gonna hit Tony. He sees Tony getting messed up. Ricky's his boy, 4d4 plus four and blasts Tony for 11 points of damage, way to go JJ."
"Zac: Hell yeah, JJ!"
"Lou: Way to go. Points on the board, JJ."
Ally: [quietly] Hell yeah.
Brennan: That's going to be Rowan.
Siobhan: Okay. I'm gonna cast Dimension Door and move myself to right here. And do smites count as spells? Can I cast Blinding Smite as a bonus action?
Brennan: You can—
Siobhan: Where are my spell slots?
Brennan: Yes. I see that Blinding Smite...
"Zac: I think it's, you have to hit--"
Brennan: You have to hit with a melee attack for Blinding Smite.
Siobhan: Yes. I am planning my next round.
"Brennan: Gotcha. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. You can cast that as a bonus action but you can't cast two spells in one turn is the issue."
Siobhan: That's why I was asking. Does a smite count as a spell?
Brennan: Yes.
Zac: Divine smite doesn't.
"Siobhan: But Blinding Smite does, cool. In which case I will say,"
"Rowan: Cody, I don't know if you can hear this, but it seems like you're… [pained pause] it seems like you've really, a lot of thought into the aesthetic. Like there's a lot of thought put into it and I appreciate that thought."
Murph: Just knocked out on my back.
[all laugh]
Zac: Almost a stranger to her.
"Murph: Just under a moped, covered in blood."
Rowan: ...a lot of effort. You’ve really--
"Brennan: Okay. That's Rowan, Kingston, that's you."
"Lou: Okay. Let's do some stuff, I'd like to cast or not cast, but Channel Divinity and use Spirits of the City. I present my holy symbol and I don't know, it's… I guess this question of whether, where we are in space. If we're in the city, “every hostile creature within 30 feet of me makes a charisma saving throw on a failed save, the creature's knocked prone or restrained…” my choice, or your choice by what. “But the restrained creature can escape by making a successful strength or athletics check.”"
Brennan: Incredible. And it's a charisma saving throw?
"Lou: It's a charisma saving throw, DC 17."
Brennan: And it's everyone you can see?
Lou: Or everyone within 30 feet of me.
"Brennan: Okay, cool. You might imagine these monks are not great at charisma saving throws, but they do have magic resistance. So...yeah. Oh, this is… they have to get 16s or higher. Fail. Succeed. Succeed. One of them is restrained."
"Lou: Great. Okay. One of them is restrained. I am going to take, Yeah. I'm gonna take a disengage and move up toward Cody."
"Brennan: I believe that you've used an action already, with the Spirits of the City."
"Lou: Oh, in that case, what do we do?"
Zac: Can Alejandro move you?
"Lou: I think I'll still take opportunity attacks. I think I'm gonna have, I'm gonna use the Gotham Timepiece. Take a level of exhaustion."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Lou: Disengage, and move 30 feet."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Fully forgot about that
"Murph: Yeah. That's a good call, Kingston."
"Brennan: Kingston, as you use the Gotham timepiece, everyone in the fight give me a Perception check."
Emily: I got a 2.
"Murph: Nat 20. Oh no, I'm knocked out."
Brennan: Totally knocked out.
Zac: I got a dirty 20.
"Siobhan: Oh no! I got a 26, I got a 26."
"Brennan: Rowan, you see, as that Gotham Timepiece gets used, New York minutes are everywhere in here with the tide of Umbra coming in tons of them are hitting Kingston's egg, obviously. [high-pitched pinging] And tons of them are hitting something on Sofia's person that you can see."
"Rowan: Oh, I love this city!"
"Brennan: Kingston, you disengage, you move, that's gonna be Alejandro."
Lou: Hold on. And then I'm gonna use my bonus action to cast a third level Healing Word on Cody.
Murph: Much appreciated.
"Brennan: Ooh baby, hell yeah."
"Lou: So let's go 3, 4, 3, 15 to Cody."
"Brennan: Cody is back up, baby."
Ally: Woo!
Brennan: Hell yes. That's gonna be Alejandro.
Lou: Alejandro is just going to close with the other wizard.
Brennan: Oh shit.
Lou: Yeah. The boys can decide what they want to do on their turn. The boys are not important here.
Brennan: And I think Alejandro...
Lou: I think he'll have to use a full dash.
Brennan: Let me see real quick what 40 feet looks like for him. Yes. He'll have to use a full dash.
Lou: Yeah. And is he within their threatened area?
Brennan: Yes. So they'll get swings on him.
"Lou: Well, two of them will."
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. That's right. Yes, yes, yes."
Lou: Yeah. He'll full dash and meet this woman.
Brennan: One of them hits Alejandro for 14.
"Lou: Cool. He drops from, or no, I think it's, yeah, he drops from 58."
"Brennan: That's now going to be, now it's these Concrete Fist monks."
Murph: [quietly] Fuck.
Zac: Oh no.
"Brennan: Cody luckily, Cody--"
Murph: I don't have a disadvantage anymore.
Brennan: You don't have a disadvantage anymore.
Murph: I'm not stunned.
Brennan: Actually did you..
Siobhan: And you have a Bardic.
Murph: Oh! Yes. But I'm still gonna get knocked out.
"Brennan: Here's the issue: when you get knocked unconscious, you go prone, I don't think you've been able to come up from prone yet."
Siobhan: He is on his moped.
"Brennan: Not after getting knocked unconscious. He's not on his moped, he's on the fucking ground."
Siobhan: He fell unconscious-- [leans her torso forward to demonstrate] He’s on the front of the moped and [sits back up] he popped back up.
"Murph: If I roll a nat 20, Brennan, can we say I fell on the moped? [laughs]"
"Brennan: Yes, hit a nat 20 right now, and you fell on the moped."
Murph: Okay. Guaranteed nat 20 coming up.
"Siobhan: Guaranteed, guaranteed, nat 20 right now."
Murph: Guaranteed nat 20. Guaranteed nat 20. Absolutely guaranteed nat 20.
Siobhan: Guaranteed nat 11 right there.
Murph: That’s an 11. That’s a natural 11.
"Siobhan: That's what Brennan said though, if you rolled an 11."
"Brennan: Even with advantage, even an advantage, first one misses. Hit."
Murph: God dammit.
Brennan: Hits.
Murph: Did any of these guys work at Modell's?
Brennan: Hit. Miss.
"Lou: Come on, one of them has gotta have worked at Modell's."
Brennan: Okay. Four hits is probably gonna drop you again.
Murph: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Wait, Cutting Words to one of them."
"Brennan: Three, only three hit. They were all close enough."
Murph: Thank you.
"Brennan: Go ahead and roll your d10, let's just make sure."
Murph: I think I'm still gonna go down no matter what.
Siobhan: Three.
"Brennan: Okay. We're gonna do this. Let me know when you drop, because there's gonna be some potential death save failures here."
Murph: Great.
Brennan: First one is 9 damage.
Murph: Still up.
Brennan: Next one is 14 damage.
"Murph: Super dead, down."
Brennan: Last one is two death save fails.
Zac: No one's attacking the moped?
"Brennan: They can't, Cody stopped them from doing that."
Zac: Dying to protect your moped...
Murph: Taking a kick straight to the nads... [laughs] Just getting punted in the face so that I could protect my moped.
Zac: Just got a wax.
Murph: The moped just absolutely looks pristine.
"Brennan: Does this guy have a plus 6 to athletics? No, does not. Other guy's still restrained trying to get out of your, you see spirits of New York are holding him in place. Other two are gonna come for you Kingston. They all still have disadvantage. Miss, miss…"
Lou raises a fist in victory.
Brennan: Hit…
Lou lowers his fist.
Brennan: Miss. Kingston...
Kingston: JJ!
[Ally chuckles]
Brennan: Kingston you take 9 points of damage. Give me that concentration check.
Lou: Okay. First one is a DC10.
Brennan: DC10.
"Lou: I have to hit a 10 to hit it, right?"
Brennan: Yes.
"Lou: Great, did it on the first one, we're good."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Sofia, that's going to be you."
Emily: [resigned] Okay. Sofia knows her place. Sofia knows that her purpose is not to do anything but stun people and Tony can't be stunned. So she's gonna run up to these monks and she's just gonna start stunning them. So they can't put Cody back down next time Kingston brings him up.
"Brennan: You're gonna get an attack of opportunity... oh, did Tony.."
Zac: He hit Pete when Pete ran away.
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: But Tony's gone since Pete ran. So this the first time..
Emily: Let me know if it hits.
Zac: Did he go since?
"Brennan: He was using legendary actions. So he's gonna, he's gonna go ahead and roll. I'm gonna roll in front of the board. You still have Shield up. So he's got to hit… So he's got to hit a..."
Emily: 24.
Brennan: He's got to hit a 24. he needs a 10 or higher. 9! Sofia skids away. Go ahead and take your attacks.
Emily: All right. Hmm. First one's going to be an 18. Does that hit?
Brennan: 18 hits.
Emily: Okay. That's a 10 damage and ki point to stun him.
"Brennan: He fails, stunned."
"Emily: Cool. He's stunned, I move to the one next to him."
Murph: I think dude with the red hair is super hurt too.
Ally: Yeah. You could just [pop]
"Emily: Yeah. I'm just trying to stun them so that they can when you get brought back up, you won't be able, they won't be able to attack you back down again."
"Brennan: Remember, also, Sofia, you had to add that extra radiant damage too."
"Emily: Oh, right. Yeah."
Ally: Amazing.
"Emily: So an extra 2. So that was 12 to the first to that guy, he's stunned now. Guy with the red hair, that's gonna be a 17. Does a 17 hit?"
"Brennan: 17 does hit, yes."
"Emily: Okay. That's gonna be a, wow, I rolled two 1s. It's gonna be a seven damage and I'm gonna spend a ki point to try to stun him."
Brennan: He is stunned as well.
"Emily: Okay. And then I'm just gonna move on to the next one. There's only three surrounding Cody, right?"
"Brennan: That's correct, yeah."
"Emily: Okay. That's gonna miss. So I'm going to Flurry of Blows… and does a 17… or 17 does hit, so that is a 9 plus 5, 14. And I'm gonna try to stun him."
Brennan: 14… he is stunned as well. All three.
Murph: Nice.
[all cheer]
"Ally: Hell yeah, dude."
"Brennan: Pow! Sofia, they are, you have stunned all the people surrounding Cody, at the end of your turn, Tony is gonna make an attack against Ricky. That's gonna be a crit."
Murph: Yikes.
"Brennan: 10, 19, 22… Ricky, you take 32 points of damage."
Zac: From the first attack?
Brennan: From his first attack.
Zac: I will Channel Divinity and Rebuke the Violent.
Brennan: Ooh.
Ally: Hell yes.
"Brennan: Tony's… He takes that, does not like it. I'm getting--"
"Zac: I'm sorry, was it 32 damage? Is that what you said?"
Brennan: Yes. I'm gonna need a strength saving throw from Ricky and then I'm gonna need a constitution saving throw.
Zac: Strength saving throw… I'm gonna use a luck point.
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Nice.
Zac: [winces] Wait. Is a 18 gonna cut it?
Brennan: He knocks you to your feet. Sorry. This would be a dex saving throw. So it's even lower.
Zac: The first one was a dex.
"Brennan: First one was a dex, yeah."
"Brennan: He puts you to the ground, you go prone. And then this is the con one, this is the big one."
Zac: Okay. That's 16.
Brennan: That's enough to overcome stunned. You are not stunned.
Ally: [whistles] Nice.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. That is, that's gonna be, these wizards are gonna start throwing some stuff. Lower right by Alejandro is gonna hit the engine with another Dispel."
Umbral Engine: Umbral engine at 600%.
"Emily: Sweet. Let me know what the upper left does. I mean, the yeah, upper left."
Brennan: Upper left? Upper left is gonna try to hit Pete with a Banishment spell.
Emily: Counterspell. You could put a counterspell in my leopard print.
Siobhan: I did.
Brennan: Okay. Banishment is fourth level.
Emily: It's a fifth level. She put a fifth level Counterspell.
"Murph: Oh, she did put a fifth level! [nodding excitedly]"
Siobhan: It’s a fifth level. Put a fifth level Counterspell in.
"Brennan: Jesus, incredible. Done."
Sofia: Iga! This is for you!
Pete: I love you!
"Ally: Er, I can't say that."
[Pete gurgles]
[Emily laughs lightly]
"Siobhan: [Iga voice] Someone, somebody is squeaking at me."
Brennan: I'm gonna need a charisma save from Rowan as well.
Siobhan: Counterspell.
Brennan: Okay. You're casting Counterspell?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Okay. This is still a fourth level spell so--
Siobhan: Fourth level counterspell.
Brennan: Okay. I'm gonna make an arcana… Give me a DC 14 arcana check to know what the level of the spell is as you're casting it.
Siobhan: I do not make it. So I'll cast it as a third level. And then I'll do my roll.
Brennan: Yeah. So you're gonna need to hit a DC 14 on a charisma check.
"Siobhan: Okay. [nods] Yeah, I got like a 28."
"Brennan: Okay, great. You knock that spell out of the air. Those are the wizards. Back to the top of the order. That's going to be Pete."
"Ally: Great. You know, I'm just gonna cast another Fireball on this person in front of me using Careful Spell."
Brennan: Hell yeah. They're gonna attempt to Counterspell it.
Ally: Do they know which level I'm using?
"Brennan: No, they don't. So they're gonna have to beat it on a roll."
Ally: Gorgeous.
"Brennan: They are gonna need, it's a third level. Oh no. You're casting Fireball right? They auto Counterspell it, blam, third level spell."
Ally: But I'm using it as a slot higher.
"Brennan: Okay. So it's a 14, so they're gonna need to roll, they need, I believe, yeah, they need an 11 or higher here."
"Ally: If I'm casting it as a fifth level, does that change anything?"
"Brennan: I'm gonna say that you said you're casting it at fourth level, so we're gonna keep it at fourth level."
"Ally: Oh, when did I say fourth?"
Zac: Just a second ago.
Brennan: Just a second ago.
[Emily laughs]
"Ally: Wait, what? No."
"Brennan: Yeah, you said “I'm casting--”"
"Murph: You said a, you said a slot up."
Brennan: Do you wanna cast it as a fifth level?
Siobhan: Yeah you said--
"Ally: No, I'm casting it as a fifth level again. So it's another 9d-whatever, yeah."
"Brennan: It would actually be 10, it's 10d6 at fifth level."
Ally: I don't remember saying fourth.
Brennan: So they're gonna need a 12 or higher to beat this.
Ally: Ya love to see it.
Brennan: That’s a 3.
Murph: Nice.
"Brennan: Pete immolates, the wizard’s blasted back through the windows that shatter behind them. That wizard is no more. Pete, any movement from you?"
"Ally: Oh, I don't even have to roll for that damage, it’s just--"
"Brennan: No, they're so close, they're toast."
"Ally: Cool. Yeah, definitely. I'm gonna come and… I'm gonna cast… So that was using subtle because I can't talk but then I'm also gonna do quicken. So that was a bonus action. So I can do like an untrained medicine check on Cody."
"Brennan: Oh, okay. Yes, yes, yes. Go ahead and… sorry, Pete, you can't do that quicken. The reason being you have to use care, you have to use subtle spell every time to overcome that crushed windpipe."
"Ally: Yeah totally. So I was just gonna spend-- Oh, I can only do one per..."
Brennan: You can only do one metamagic per spell.
"Ally: Oh, okay. Cool. Then I have way more sorcery points than I thought I did. Okay, cool."
"Murph: I have Bardic, I have Bardic so if it gets to my turn I could die, but I, the odds are in my favor."
"Ally: Oh okay, cool. Then I'm just gonna be here in the mix. You know, actually just fuck it. I'm gonna do a double."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: Pete, go ahead and give me a wild magic surge roll."
Ally: Oh right. Nat 1.
[various gasps]
Brennan: Gimme two d100 rolls.
Emily: I just realized that you’ve had a beard of feathers this whole time.
[all laugh]
"Ally: [laughs] Yeah. All right, that's a 92, and it's a 28."
"[suspenseful ""oh no Pete"" music]"
Brennan: There is something that will dramatically help your spell casting. And there's something here that has to do with the magic of life and death.
Zac: [chuckles] Two sides of the same coin.
"Ally: Two sides of the same coin, let me think about it."
Murph: Cody just whispering to himself.
Zac: Leaking all over his moped.
Siobhan: Does this guy have a cat fight?
Ally: Ya know… I'm gonna go with life and death.
"Brennan: A tether of wild magic springs from you to the heart of the Umbral engine. We will come back to you and what you have just done to the nature of the magical cosmos later, baby!"
Ally: Wow.
"Brennan: End of end of your turn. Tony is gonna take his last legendary action for the round and hits Ricky Matsui. And he's gonna deal Ricky, Jesus! 28 points of damage."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: Let me actually, he might've crit on that… no he did not."
"Zac: Wait, does Haste change my armor class?"
Brennan: Goes up by one. I've already been factoring that in.
"Zac: Oh yeah, cool."
"Ally: It goes up by two, but yeah."
Brennan: It goes up by two? Okay. So that is going to go and be Cody's turn.
Zac: Do I have to make any kind of saving throw?
"Brennan: You don't, he only stuns on every second attack, so you're okay. And he's already knocked you prone. Yeah. He's, you know what, actually he's gonna hit you with a thing that prevents you from taking reactions until your next turn."
Zac: Ow. [laughs]
"Brennan: So that's gonna be Cody, death save Cody."
"Murph: All right. I'll roll it in front of the table, if I-- Oh my god. Okay. I think no matter what Bardic can save me, even if it's a terrible thing, unless I get a one, in which case it will likely be rolled an auto fail. So let's see what happens. Please be good."
Siobhan: Yes!
Brennan: 12.
Murph: Okay. Don't even need Bardic.
"Brennan: Cody, you are one death save away. You are one death save away from all of this roiling Umbra. You see dimensions fading around you. You get a success, you see… a fiery set of gates near you."
[nu metal plays]
Brennan: On that success and because sort of realms are being torn apart here by all this raw umbra you see the Gates of Hell open. Walking out in an extremely metal t-shirt is a 120 foot tall demon. Wreathed in fire who comes out.
"Demon: [deep voice] [takes a drag] Are you Cody fucking Walsh, man?"
Cody: Yeah. Some people call me the Night Angel. Others call me the Jersey Devil.
Demon: Sick.
Cody: Dude. You're so much cooler than the other devil I know… Do you know Bazathrax?
Demon: Bazathrax is a fucking dick.
"Cody: He kind of is, he just lives in my chest and he just smokes and fucks around and never knows what's going on."
"Brennan: He reaches out, just like picks you up in his massive hand and goes,"
Demon: Your soul belongs to Hell. [looks up] But it looks like your time might not be over yet. We need to move fast.
"Brennan: And he starts to move back in, back in."
Demon: [takes a drag] Nice to meet you. I'm Lucifer.
Murph: Oh fucking hell yes!
Brennan: We dip back into battle.
[Brennan & Murph laugh aloud]
"Murph: [laughing] Lucifer's just an edgelord, that's so fucking funny."
"Brennan: Lucifer… you see, actually the last thing Lucifer says as he looks out and sees like the umbral engine, sees Hell, sees Faerie, and looks up and sees the pearly gates is he looks up and looks at the pearly gates and goes,"
"Lucifer: [takes a drag and shakes his fist at the sky] Fuck you, Dad, fuck you!"
"Murph: [laughs] I also just start screaming, “Fuck you, Dad.”"
"Brennan: “Fuck you, dad.” And you walk into hell with Lucifer, back into the combat. That is going to be Tony Simos' turn. Tony is going to take his attacks on Ricky. Okay."
Zac: Starting to feel like Shield of Faith would have been a good idea.
"Brennan: That's a hit. That's a hit. That's a miss. That's a hit. Oh shit, no, you're prone, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: Yeah. That's four hits.
Zac: I'm probably down.
"Brennan: We're gonna roll these damages one by one, Ricky. And we'll do the saves for them as we go."
[suspenseful music]
Brennan: That's gonna be-- Our first one is going to be… 25 damage. Next one is…
Zac: I'm at 16.
Brennan: Next one. Next one puts you down.
"Zac: Can I use one of my luck points to try to make, he's got advantage. So it's like, I dunno. It isn’t necessarily worth it."
Brennan: The next one puts you down. Tony is going to-- He's got you at zero. He thuds a fist into your chest to give two death save failures but saves his last attack.
"Zac: I mean, if he would kill me, he can kill me."
"Brennan: I actually don't think he would. I think he wants to kill you and Sofia in the same round. If he can. Yeah. ‘Cause he wants, he needs those legendaries to be able to hit Sofia. So he's gonna move here."
Zac: Ox can take an opportunity attack.
Brennan: Yeah. Have Ox go for the opportunity attack.
Zac: He doesn't hit.
"Brennan: He swings, hits Sofia."
"Emily: I don't think I've-- Oh, no, I used my reaction to Counterspell."
"Brennan: Yeah. Sofia, you take 19 points of damage. I'm going to need a strength saving throw from Sofia."
"Emily: Okay… [sighs] Oh, 19 on the die."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: So that becomes… That becomes 25.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Okay.
Emily: That would have been a crit if I had used it against him.
"Brennan: [groans in sympathy] Both your Paladins are down. Tony has closed with Sofia. Ricky, that's your turn, I'm gonna need a death saving throw at the top of your turn."
Murph: You have those luck points. You have luck points.
Emily: You have luck points.
Zac: 19.
[cast cheers]
Brennan: Hell yes.
Zac: It would have been nice to get a 20.
Ally: Is that two saves?
"Zac: A 20 is, you come back up at one."
Siobhan: 20 is you pop up at 1.
Murph: 20 is you pop up at 1.
Zac: Remember Kristen?
Ally: Ya know...you're right.
"Murph: Brennan, even though I was knocked out, even though it's flavored as a moped, it is still like a magical thing. Can I have sent it to Kingston?"
Brennan: Yes you can.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: Moped scoots over to Kingston. Incredible.
Lou: Kingston regards the moped.
[all laugh]
Lou: But does not initially mount it.
Murph: It absolutely revs.
Brennan: End of Ricky's turn. Tony's gonna take another swing at Sofia. That's a hit.
Zac: Can Ox go?
"Brennan: Ox can go, yeah, absolutely."
Zac: Ox is gonna close with Tony.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Or actually..
"Siobhan: He would get a charge attack as well, right? Cause it's more than 20 feet?"
Brennan: Yep.
"Zac: Yeah, if it's, yeah, sure."
Siobhan: Knock this bitch prone.
"Zac: I don't see that necessarily happening, but sure."
Siobhan: You can try.
"Ally: Where there is a will, there is a way."
"Zac: Sorry, and looking at his charge attack. Okay. So it's just a bite and he gets Pack Tactics cause people are near?"
Brennan: Yes.
Zac: Okay. I don't think he even hits. So he just ran up there.
"Brennan: Oh, he's helping. He's a helping boy. Sofia, you take 20 points of damage."
Emily: I'm down.
"Brennan: That, you're incapacitated, you are going to auto fail the next saving throw that Tony would have imposed on you. You run up, all the other monks are stunned. Tony runs up, grabs Sofia, goes,"
"Tony: My wife was an angel, and let me send you to see yours."
"Sofia: Just so you know, you're doing this to a pregnant woman."
Tony: Shouldn't’a… [shrugs] I don't feel great about that.
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: And he tosses you, Sofia, you go unconscious. He tosses Sofia 15 feet into the Umbral engine."
"Ally: Does he, does he have to make a roll for that?"
"Brennan: Sofia would have had to make a roll. That's what those strength saving throws for us has been about, that Sofia has kept succeeding on. He tosses Sofia into the Umbral engine. At the beginning of Sofia's next turn, some kind of shit is gonna happen to her. Pete, your wild magic surge. You have a choice right now. Do you want to connect that wild magic surge to Sofia? Pete, it's a wild magic surge, Pete doesn't fully understand what it is, but you know that she is flying off and is going to be, she will be erased from all of everybody's memories."
"Ally: Yeah. I mean, definitely. Yeah, definitely."
"Brennan: Incredible. Sofia vanishes from everyone's sight going through the Umbral engine and Pete lassoes her with his wild magic surge. Pete, you are pulled, slam, hit the railing of that thing and a tether of raw wild magic coming from your navel is you are like holding with a rope of magic onto Sofia as she has gone like through the portal, into time and space."
Ally: I mean the birth imagery in this season is incredible. Incredible. Fucking like pregnant Spider-Man.
[all laugh]
Ally: Fetus Spider-Man.
"Brennan: Please give us the art. Please give us the fan art of pregnant Spider-Man. Incredible. Okay. You feel… Pete, your life force is tethered to Sofia's right now through this wild magic surge. That… Ricky has succeeded on his save. JJ…"
Emily: Do I have to do a death save or anything? Oh no. It's not my turn.
Brennan: Not your turn yet. You're good for right now.
Ally: So am I just like...here?
"Brennan: No, no. You're up where you were against that, you're, do you see that marble bannister around the edge to keep people from touching it. You're like horizontal, like someone up against the side of a ship with like a lifesaver on a raft. JJ… Ah, your buddy, what are you gonna do? JJ doesn't have any healing, but he's gonna run up and give the help action to Ricky's next saving throw. He goes like, full crying, He goes like,"
"JJ: Rick! Rick, man, come on."
Brennan: And collapses on top of you. And that's going to be Rowan Berry.
"Siobhan: This what I would like to do, I'd like to move to here… Before actually, before I do this, can I use my… If I steal Cody's watch, Gotham watch can I cast two spells? I'll just take my level of exhaustion."
"Brennan: If you steal Cody's watch, can you…  I think you can, you still can't… Give me a sleight of hand check."
Siobhan: 25.
"Brennan: Great. You nab the watch, throw it on. What does Rowan do?"
Siobhan: Okay. I would like to cast Cure Wounds on Cody.
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Thank you.
"Brennan: ...at, let's say, a fourth level Cure Wounds."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: So that's 4d8 plus 5, so that's 28 to Cody."
Murph: Thank you.
"Siobhan: And then use the watch to cast Steel Wind Strike. So it's a melee spell attack within, of against any one within 30 feet. So I can get all of these three monks who I believe are still stunned right? So I would roll against them with advantage?"
"Brennan: Yes, you roll against them with advantage."
Siobhan: And also Tony and it's 6d10.
"Brennan: Ooh, Jesus."
Siobhan: So I guess I'll go down this line of monks
"Zac: And it's, what is it?"
"Brennan: On a hit, a target takes 6d10 force damage. So roll with advantage against these monks."
Siobhan: So this first one I got 26.
Brennan: 26 hits.
Siobhan: Second one I rolled two nat 1’s.
Brennan: Terrible.
"Siobhan: Third one, I, this both of these are cocked. Third one, I only rolled a 14."
Brennan: 14\. The fourth one you only rolled a 14?
"Siobhan: Third one, I rolled 14."
Brennan: Okay. You did not hit that one either.
"Siobhan: Okay. And then against Tony, I rolled a 21."
Brennan: 21 misses.
Siobhan: Shit.
Brennan: But you do hit the first one for 6d10 force damage.
"Siobhan: All right. 29, yeah, that's low."
"Brennan: Okay. 29. But you do bring Cody back up, looking at the turns now. Rowan, you cast this strike, harm one of the monks that's still stunned next to Cody. Cody, in Hell, Lucifer is walking with you, goes,"
"Lucifer: Oh, so you want to be a servant of the darkness, huh?"
"Cody: Actually, was thinking more like I could be a Lord of the darkness. [takes a hit off a cigarette butt]"
Lucifer: Where the hell did you get the cigarette butt?
[all laugh]
"Cody: The past couple, somebody took my jacket which had all the butts in it. But I've been collecting butts for a couple of weeks now."
"Brennan: You see, he looks at it and goes"
"Lucifer: Sick. It's that, where'd you get that duster? Is that a fucking, like, eBay duster?"
"Cody: No, this isn't… the, there were actually some Satanists in New York who are like leather workers and shit. So this is like, real, like, Lucifer-type dudes."
Lucifer: You've passed the test.
[Murph and Brennan laugh loudly]
"Brennan: You see Lucifer walk out with you. You see Lucifer walks forward with you and says,"
Lucifer: Looks like you need a little bit of time.
"Brennan: And you see he taps a giant finger on the flickering image of your Gotham timepiece as Rowan takes it, uses that magic to create a bubble, slides an anvil in front of you, a flaming hot forge of hell, and says"
Lucifer: You know what to fuckin' do. Get to work. You have as much time in the bubble as you need.
"Cody: Fucking hell yeah, dude."
"Brennan: Lucifer looks at you and says,"
"Lucifer: Night Angel, you have a lot of choices in front of you. You hold the Questing Blade. And yet, perhaps that is not the power you seek."
[Cody nods as he takes a drag]
"Lucifer: Here, you may forge a new blade for yourself. When you return to the mortal world, go with the fires of hell."
"Brennan: Oh, you see, he touches your tattoo, rips Bazathrax out of it, looks at him and says,"
Lucifer: Lemme see that contract.
Brennan: And gestures to you.
Murph: [laughs] I hand him the WWE poster.
"Brennan: Lucifer says,"
Lucifer: Is this on a fuckin' WWE poster?
"Cody: Yeah, we, it was a rush job to be sure."
Lucifer: Who's your favorite wrestler?
"Cody: My favorite wrestler is Jeff Hardy, dude."
"Lucifer: Jeff, fucking Hardy boys, man I love the fucking Hardy boys."
[both talk over each other]
"Lucifer: Fucking sick, jumps off ladders and shit."
"Lucifer and Cody: Fucking sick, dude."
Cody: Fucking awesome.
Brennan: Satan creates a massive Jeff Hardy poster.
[all laugh]
Murph: Oh my god.
"Brennan: Pens you a new contract with him on the back. Says,"
Lucifer: Sign here.
"Cody: Listen, Lucifer, the only, so when you were like saying like, fuck you to heaven and stuff, I just wanna like, honestly, since I am gonna be like a Lord, but like a Lord under you, I don't wanna like go above my pay grade here. But I just wanna say that we are two sides of the same coin. So I will be fighting, I will be using the fires of hell to bring the light to the mortal realm."
Lucifer: [takes a drag] The first test was a fake test. You just passed the real test.
[all laugh]
Murph: I absolutely sign in my blood.
[all laugh]
"Brennan: The contract reflects that as a lord of hell, you are now getting your powers from Lucifer but that Lucifer also that you, as a lord, there is respect because as Lucifer said “fuck you” to his dad, he provides you license to say “fuck you” to your lord because it would not be in keeping with the traditions of Hell if you could not say “fuck you” to him. So he basically in the actual clause, says “the Night Angel AKA Cody Walsh retains all rights to fuck shit up and go metal in his own way and do his own shit” and the contract is created in flame, poster is given to you. Lucifer looks at Bazathrax and goes,"
Lucifer: I'm demoting you. You work for Cody now.
"Brennan: And flicks him back into your chest, when he goes,"
"Bazathrax: Oh what the fuck, dude?"
"Cody: This is arguably worse, but I'm happy to stick it to Bazathrax."
"Brennan: Lucifer goes,"
"Lucifer: Fuck yeah, metal as hell, bro."
"Cody: Fuck yeah, dude. Thanks, Lucifer."
"Brennan: Cool. And leaves you with this forge. What does, what does Cody do here? You know, frozen in time before that Cure Wounds takes place?"
"Murph: Oh boy. I think, despite the fact that he just had this absolutely metal moment with Hell he can't undo everything he's learned and go like full ridiculous video game. So I think he's just going to make his sword into the most just like bad-ass two-hander, like, kind of like viking barbarian sword."
"Brennan: Hell yes. And are you, you're doing this to the Questing Blade, right?"
"Murph: I think I'll ask the Questing Blade,"
"Cody: Questing Blade, is this like cool If I just make you like just a, a reasonable, big cool sword? Like there's a name for it and everything. It's just like a two-hander."
Brennan: Yeah. The Questing Blade looks to you and says
"Questing Blade: It would be an honor to serve in the fashion you would have me, Night Angel."
[Murph chuckles]
"Cody: Sick, and also as is my contract with Lucifer, you can also say ""fuck you"" to me if you want."
Questing Blade: I do not see an occasion for that on the horizon but it is good to know.
"Brennan: Cody, I'm adding something to your inventory right now. As you forge this sword… Go ahead, refresh your sheet. The Questing Blade, AKA, you name it what you want to name it, but check your sheet for it. Rowan, Cody is brought back wreathed in flame. [demon noises]"
[metal plays]
Brennan: And you have been to Hell and back. You are literally a resurrected dark fucking knight of Hell.
Murph: Absolutely hell yeah. I don't even notice that somebody stole my watch.
[all laugh]
Brennan: And you have a new greatsword with those following abilities there. Dope as hell.
"Siobhan: How many swords is that now that Cody's had, like eight?"
"Emily: [laughs] I know, right? This campaign has just been like a bouquet of swords."
"Brennan: That's what we should call it. Incredible, Kingston, That is your turn."
Lou: Okay. What is the distance on this moped?
Brennan: I think the speed is 50 or something like that.
Lou: 50\. Okay. Ooh. Okay.
"Zac: You can double move too, right?"
Lou: Great. Yeah. I'm gonna use a disengage.
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: Hop on the moped, ride the moped, though I do not love it."
[Murph laughs]
"Lou: A full, like I think it's 20, 25, another 20. So that's 65 and then I will, Yeah. So then we'll go and I'll drive, I'll ride 25 feet past Ricky. There you go, and then we'll cast Mass Cure Wounds. And we'll hit Pete. We’ll hit Cody, Ricky… Pete, Cody, Ricky. Rowan, are you okay?"
"Siobhan: I'm fine, get Sofia."
Lou: So can I hit Sofia? Is Sofia in our space and time?
"Brennan: Pete, as that healing hits you you feel the potential to pass that healing away from you through the tether."
"Ally: Absolutely. Okay, cool."
"Lou: With that knowledge, can I give it to Pete twice? Is that possible?"
"Brennan: Yeah. I'll say, yeah. Give it to Pete twice."
"Lou: Great. So it's double up on Pete. Double up on Pete, Ricky, Cody, I'll hit myself. That's, I mean, I still get one more. Can I double up on Ricky? I mean, is double up a thing now? No, those five and then Ox, is Ox hurt?"
Zac: No.
[Brennan laughs]
Lou: Great. Then I just hit those five.
"Brennan: Kingston, this is a powerful act of healing. What do you say to the—"
"Lou: Oh, excuse me, to do it, I am hitting the time piece a second time. So I have two levels of exhaustion."
"Brennan: Oh, sorry. I don't, you actually can't hit the time piece more than once per long rest."
Lou: Great. Then let me take two opportunity attacks from those gentlemen up top.
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: Wait, which gentlemen, are they the ones who are stunned?"
"Brennan: No, one's down a little bit right here."
Murph: He’s on the other side of the room.
"Brennan: Kingston, you take 10 points of damage. Give me a DC 10 concentration."
"Lou: Okay… Pass. Great. But yeah. So without doing... 3d8, one, two, three, Oh we love to see it. That's gonna be 13, 14, 19 to everyone."
[gentle healing music]
Ally: Hell yeah. I pass that to Sofia through the umbilical cord that she's attached to.
"Siobhan: In many ways, Pete is Sofia's baby."
"Emily: Like, whose baby is who, you know? The umbilical cord goes both ways."
Ally: Who's the baby now?
"Brennan: The t-shirt from this season has to be “this umbilical cord goes both ways.” Amazing. Cool, incredible healing from Kingston. That's going to be boom, boom. Cool. That's Alejandro, baby."
Lou: Two attacks on the wizard. First one is for 13.
Zac: Do you still have Blur?
Lou: I do have Blur.
Brennan: JJ hasn't been hit.
Zac: Oh.
Murph: Nice.
Lou: First hit on the wizard for 13.
Brennan: The wizard casts Shield.
"Lou: Ah, damn. Second hit is for 15."
"Brennan: 15 is gonna miss with that as well. Alejandro, fighting in the halls of his ancient society once more. That's going to go from Alejandro to be these Concrete Fist monks. These two… are going to make--"
Zac: Are they still stunned?
"Brennan: They're stunned until the end of Sofia's next turn, right?"
Emily: Yeah. The three ones up here are stunned.
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So they're still all stunned but they're gonna come out of it right now. These two--"
"Emily: No, ‘cause won’t they, they'll come out of it on my turn."
"Brennan: Yes. Sorry on your turn, exactly. Then these two dudes, hoo, the, they are far away from everybody. Let's see here. Where can they even go? That guy's gonna try to break out of the restrain, does not, still restrained by Spirits of the City. These two are going to move and close with Alejandro down here, but they don't get to attack. That's now going to be, after them is Sofia. Sofia is in the void right now, cause I wanna end the episode on Sofia. So we're gonna resolve Gramercy really quickly. This one right here has already, I mean, they've already used their Banishments. This one's going to try to Dispel Magic."
"Siobhan: Ah, Counterspell."
Brennan: You're a million miles from that.
"Siobhan: Oh, there's this one down here."
"Brennan: Yeah lower right, yeah. Actually, you know what? That one on the upper right is gonna try to cast Dispel Magic. Yeah, go ahead and Counterspell. It's a third little slot, you auto Counterspell it. The one in the lower right is gonna hit with a Dispel as well. No one's within 60 of that. You hear the Umbral engine go…"
Umbral Engine: 750%.
Brennan: One more dispel on the umbral engine is gonna get the job done.
[dramatic orchestral music]
"Brennan: Sofia, you come to… You are flying through the Umbral arcana through time. You look in two different directions around you and actually, at the beginning of it, you know, you're cured."
"Emily: Yeah, I’m alive."
"Brennan: You're alive. You look and see the dreaming. You see Null approaching, pushing all possible future past this day like water coming in a tsunami and see it all collapsing on this moment. You see the present where everyone is forgetting magic, their ability to see magic disanimating. You look in the other direction and see the past, all of New York City's past being moved in front of you. You see this tether going to you and you see your Gotham timepiece. This is the enemies trying to deliver the killing blow. In delivering the killing blow, they're pushing more raw umbra to the city than there has ever been before. That means there are more New York minutes than there have ever been before. They are everywhere, all around you, Sofia, all around you, your Gotham timepiece. And one other thing that you are holding because you found it earlier today, which are all those letters you wrote about your life with Dale. Sofia, I'm gonna ask you to re-read the powers of the Gotham timepiece. And I'm going to ask you to remember what the book said about Paradise's relationship with resurrection."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: This is a heavy, this is a heavy one."
Emily: This is gonna be yet another “I choose myself” kind of I don’t understand what's going on for a while. Okay. “Time travel into objects with variable DC based on the object's connection to the past.”
Brennan: Sofia looks at those pages. Very few things could be said to have a stronger connection to the past.
"Emily: Yeah, that was the one I thought would be the case. And then what do I remember that I read about heaven?"
"Brennan: Heaven always releases souls… If they've made a mistake and collected a soul that they shouldn't have. And the issue you've always had is that heaven always had proof that Dale was killed by Isabella Infierno, they didn't make a mistake. If they had made a mistake and collected Dale's soul if he hadn't died, they would of course have to return him. And Sofia, I'm gonna say, go ahead and give me a, actually this is just a perception check cause you're looking at that stuff being pushed on the Umbra towards you."
Emily: It's a dirty 20 perception check.
"Brennan: Hell yes. You look at all the past approaching you when you were in Ellis Island you only had these gateways that were very limited and Gotham timepieces only work in areas of heavy Umbra anyway, even in normal magic New York you can't really time travel with these. All of New York's past is being shoved through the umbral engine, right at this moment not just the past here, the Gramercy Occult Society."
Emily: Is this a fucked up thing? Like I can change this one moment in the past and make it so that he wasn't killed by Isabella Infierno.
Brennan: You could change any moment in the past that you had access to a physical object of but you only have physical objects of your memories of Dale. You can go back to a moment in Dale's life.
"Emily: Oh, okay. So I use the Gotham timepiece to go into my own writing."
Brennan: Sofia… words are moving past you. All of New York's past is behind you. You see you meeting Dale on Staten Island. You see him coming in to get haircuts at First Class Luxury Beauty Salon.
Emily smiles.
"Brennan: You see you guys eloping and getting married. You see all of this coming back at you. New York minutes are flooding around you. You see through the stream, you see the gates of hell where, where Cody just was. You see Faerie and you see paradise and you hear through the distortion of all the Umbra the spinning of the engine. You hear,"
"Dale: Let me go, let me go! I didn't really die!"
"Brennan: And you hear a cry,"
Dale: My kid's out there somewhere!
"Brennan: And you move through your writing, see yourself, see the moment where Dale says goodbye to you for the last time. It was,"
"Dale: Hey, hon, I got some work back at the office. I gotta go take care of. I'll be back in a couple hours."
"Brennan: This world is made up of everything in your handwriting. So you see your signature in the shape of your own silhouette and it's you from the past going ""Bye, sweetie."" Like, ""See you the next time."" You are here in the moment as like a ghost, a vision, a memory. What do you do as you hear the car start out in this insane past memory landscape."
Emily: I run in front of the car.
Sofia: Wait!
"Brennan: A car, which is basically just a collection of like hood, wheels… You're looking at it like a Staten Island… It's like flickering into three dimensions. You see Dale gets out of the front seat… And goes,"
"Dale: Sweetie, is that you? Why you, did you just change?"
Sofia: Yeah. I just feel like work can wait till tomorrow.
"Brennan: You see that… [umbral blasts, sorta in the tune of the Terminator theme] all of this sort of moves around and you can see the rest of time, like coming around to like, push the time stream back into the shape it was ‘cause like, all the events that happened, if Dale had like, if Dale had like never died, how would all of the events of three years ago have happened? How would all this other stuff have happened and you see you move through the Gotham timepiece, see Dale go,"
"Dale: Okay, I, if you want me to stay I'll..."
"Brennan: And he suddenly is back in his car and drives off, moves back and his car is taking off down the road."
Emily: I run after the car.
Brennan: You're sprinting after the car. You keep seeing him flick--
Emily: I wanna get the car and I wanna throw a high heel to try to break the wheels on the car.
Brennan: Make an attack roll!
Emily: Okay...
Emily: That's a 25.
Murph: This just looks like an insane breakup.
[laughs]
Murph: Classic Staten Island breakup.
"Sofia: I really wanna fucking hang out tonight. We work too much, we need more quality time!"
"Brennan: Sofia, you begin to run and through your own, like, hit the car, boom. Time pushes you back. You are single-handedly fighting time itself right now."
"Emily: Does this feel like I'm doing something wrong? Am I gonna like fuck over the world? If I change, if I try to change this?"
Brennan: Give me an insight check.
Emily: That's gonna be an eight.
"Ally: Through my umbilical cord, can I give her the help action?"
"Brennan: Oh shit Pete, give me an arcana check."
"Ally: Oh, that's great. 21."
Brennan: Pete. You're looking through…
[dramatic violin music]
"Brennan: Sofia… Sofia, can't bring Dale back in the past because then none of you would've met and none of these things would have ever happened. Pete, Sofia… doesn't need to save Dale."
"Emily: She needs to make sure he, they don't kill him. Let them take your soul, but don't let them kill you?"
"Brennan: Yes. And you see Sofia, you need to move through Pete, on that 21 as well. Yeah. So exactly. You need to go to the moment where Dale died."
"Ally: I mean, I have Mind Link. I can try to Mind Link with her and tell her my--"
Brennan: This is the dream shit.
Ally: \--hypothesis.
"Brennan: Yeah. You have Mind Link, So you have like, like a man in the van. Who's Pete back in the real world going, Sofia, you see Dale on a computer in his accounting firm looking and see Isabella Infierno about to immolate him in fire, hiding from the shadows."
Emily: Is she going to take his soul first and then kill him?
Brennan: It looks like she's just going to kill him.
"Sofia: Hey! [snaps her fingers] Isabella, we haven't met yet."
"Brennan: She turns to look at you. She turns, goes to immolate Dale. Give me one last arcana check from Pete. One last perception check from Sofia."
"Ally: Okay. 20, but not nat."
Emily: 21.
"Brennan: Sofia. You don't, Sofia, you look and see her as she looks at you go, is amazed you're here, goes to finish her spell. You realize she's about to immolate the seat with Dale in it. You don't need to save Dale, you need to kidnap Dale. You can't change the past, but you can change the future."
Emily: All right. I tackle Dale out of the seat. [laughs]
Brennan: You… boom!... tackle Dale.
Emily: Missing a shoe.
[Murph laughs]
Pete: Do you need me to pull you up?
Sofia: I don’t know yet.
"Brennan: Pete, give me an athletics check with advantage."
"Ally: Hell yeah. Okay. That is a...what's my athletics? Pretty good, pretty good. Okay. That's a 15."
"Brennan: You hit a 15, you yank on it. Sofia, you grab Dale. Isabella immolates the chair in the past, as you were both covered in flame and you are yanked out of that time, leaving Isabella believing that she has just completely destroyed Dale Lee. You begin to fly through time. As this version of Dale looks at you and goes,"
Past!Dale: Hon? I'm a little bit confused.
"Brennan: And as you approach the present moment, he says,"
"Past!Dale: Hon, what's going on, is everything okay?"
"Sofia: Yeah, I'm pregnant and I wanted to tell you."
"Brennan: You hear another voice say,"
"Angel!Dale: [frantic] Hon, I know you're pregnant. I heard you at the airport."
"Brennan: You see angel Dale moving through time and Dale from the past, As you change the past and pull Dale's body from three and a half years ago, Dale's soul from heaven gets released - because Dale Lee never died. Sofia and Dale Lee explode from the Umbral engine."
[Emily laughs in disbelief]
Murph and Zac clap.
Emily: Wait. Are there two Dales now?
"Brennan: No, cause it was Dale's body from the past and Dale's soul from the present."
Emily: Oooohhhh! [laughs] Cool. We immediately make out.
[all laugh]
Brennan: That's all for this episode of The Unsleeping City. Tune in next week for the thrilling conclusion to the fight at Gramercy.

"(♪ The Unsleeping City theme plays, penultimately ♪)"
"Brennan: Hello, one and all, and welcome back to another thrilling episode of the Unsleeping City. This, our penultimate episode, we find ourselves, the Gramercy Occult Society, facing off against Tony Simos, and traitorous Gramercy wizards, as well as loyalists to Tony Simos from the Order of the Concrete Fist, here supercharging the umbral engine to bring about an end to magic and unbeknownst to Tony Simos, an end to time itself. However, our champions of New York City are here to stop them. Kingston Brown rushing in with his old friend Alejandro summoned, Cody was shot to hell and reforged the questing blade after making a sick contract on the back of a Jeff Hardy poster with Lucifer. Pete Conlan tethered from the navel to Sofia Lee also to the navel, as she shot back through time. Ricky, dealt more than a hundred points of damage with Esther's baseball bat, who we still have not seen his fight even though Ricky can sense her close by. Rowan Berry casting Counterspells back and forth and Sofia found Dale in the past using her Gotham timepiece to dive through memory into the past itself. And just like you guys were able to pull Peter Stuyvesant's wooden leg out of the time stream. Sofia Lee pulled her husband into the future. And of course, as we all know, heaven won't keep a soul if the person that they took it from never actually died. And since as Dale Lee never actually died, your boy's got his soul back. Dale and Sofia Lee are making out in front of an umbral engine that is one Dispel Magic away from ending time and space. Folks, you gotta see it to believe it. We dive back in the initiative order. Sofia, you did a bunch of stuff on your turn, but you also did it in the past. So it's your turn."
"Emily: Oh, yes, I was gonna use my Gotham timepiece anyways and I don't even have to."
"Brennan: Dale goes on the same initiative as you. Up to you, whether you want to go at the same time, what is everybody going to do. You see he's tearfully kissing you. He's gleaming, he's a human man again but he's still got some of that celestial radiance. He never actually died-"
Emily: He always did.
Brennan: He always did.
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: Weeping, he looks at you and he says,"
Dale: We're gonna be a family.
"Brennan: And it's just, tears, tears."
"Sofia: I know, I know."
"Emily: I think that I look at Tony and I say, and I say,"
"Sofia: Hey, good news, you don't have to be First Fist anymore because the First Fist is back."
"Emily: And then I'm gonna be like,"
"Sofia: Dale, you can probably finish him off."
"Emily: And I'm gonna run to this, this other wizard, right, is still like is not stunned or anything."
"Brennan: Hell yes. Which wizard is that, the upper right?"
"Emily: The one up, yeah."
"Brennan: Upper right is not stunned, not fucked up at all."
"Emily: Okay, so I'm actually gonna use a, I'm gonna use a bonus action to get to maybe… No, no, no, I'm not going to. Yeah, I'm gonna use a bonus action to… No I'm just gonna fucking, yeah I'm gonna use a bonus action to get to them and that'll give me advantage on my first 'cause I'm using Shadow Step. Oh, sorry, I should have asked. Is there any shadow around them or I can just use Step of the Wind."
Brennan: Probably you should use Step of the Wind. Are you using that for a dash or a disengage?
"Emily: I'm using it for, these guys are all stunned."
Siobhan: But you're right next to Tony.
Brennan: Tony is right next to you.
"Emily: But I'm right next to Tony. Yeah, you know what, fuck it. I guess I'm just gonna go after Tony then. Do you all feel-"
"Brennan: Yeah, I mean, he's got you. Dale looks at you and goes,"
"Dale: Honey, I know you've got this."
"Brennan: He looks over at Tony and he says,"
"Dale: Can I just say, I've heard stories about you. Hitting a pregnant woman, even if you're trying to end the world? You're a disgusting man."
"Sofia: He's scum, he's absolutely scum. He's brought out the worst in me."
"Brennan: Dale is going to invoke a, is going to invoke an aura, that it gives anyone who is married to him within ten feet."
[Emily laughs]
"Siobhan: Oh, he's a wife guy!"
Brennan: He summons a wife guy--
Emily: I am too though. I'm a wife guy too.
"Brennan: He summons a wife guy aura, which gives anyone within ten feet who’s married to him attack-- advantage on all their attack rolls."
"Emily: Oh my God, did you hear about how hard I was having rolling, honey?"
"Brennan: “Honey,” he goes, “oh, honey.” And then as a bonus action, is going to cast a Magic Weapon at his one six level slot, which is going to give Sofia plus three to attack and damage rolls."
Emily: (laughing) Stop!
"Sofia: Hun, this is really far too nice."
"Emily: Okay then, so now I roll with advantage?"
Brennan: You roll with advantage within this 10 foot aura and you have a plus three to attack and damage rolls.
"Emily: Wow, I mean, this is serious wife-- I promise I will fucking get you back for this. Okay, first attack is going to be a 20. Wait, I add a plus three to my attacks?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Magic Weapon at a six level spell slot does… Is a plus three to attack."
"Emily: It adds it to the attack thing? The attack roll, fuck me. All right, I got a 24 then."
"Brennan: 24, yeah, there you go."
"Emily: So I hit him for, and… Is my Hexblade Curse still active or no?"
"Brennan: Yes, still active."
"Emily: I mean, this is just unreal. Okay, that's gonna be, that's gonna be 15. Going after him again, that's gonna hit even without the plus three, that's gonna be a, hold on, eight. That's my first fucking time on the eight, you know, that's gonna be another eight plus nine, 17. I'm going to, oh, wait, roll with advantage, Nine plus three plus nine, doesn't hit. Okay, that's a miss. I'm going to Flurry of Blows."
Zac: Hell yeah.
"Emily: That's a 19, I fucking finally crit on him."
(group cheering)
Murph: Nice.
"Emily: That's gonna be, it was when my off hand though, That is gonna-"
Brennan: That's still 2d6 plus 2d4.
"Emily: Oh, I haven't been doing my radiant damage."
Brennan: You're doing radiant damage on all of these.
"Emily: All right, okay, so that's nine plus four plus five plus four. Nine, 13, 18, 22. And then also for the other two hits that's four, five. So 22, five from the previous ones, I'm going to tap into my watch and attack him two more times."
Brennan: Oh my God!
Lou: There we go.
Siobhan: Fuck him up.
"Emily: That's gonna hit, that's a 27 even without the plus three. That is a three plus five plus four. 12. And then my final attack is, oh so close to a crit, it is gonna hit though. Nine plus four, 13."
Brennan: How much were those last two attacks?
"Emily: Oh I wasn't rolling, I didn't roll radiant on those. 13. Ah, fuck me. Three and four. So plus another seven."
Brennan: Jesus Christ.
"Emily: I don't know how much all that was, I'm sorry, I should have just rolled it all."
"Brennan: All good. No, you've dealt a titanic amount of damage. Tony has now moved from looking hurt to looking truly fucked up. Spit and blood is pouring out of his mouth. He's got like a drunk boxer, like not steady on his feet anymore, but still looks like he's got fight left in him."
(groaning)
"Brennan: That's your action, attack action, Sofia, any movements from you?"
"Emily: When I use that to get an extra action, does that mean that I get, does that mean that I get an extra bonus action? I'm guessing no."
Brennan: No.
"Emily: Okay, cool."
"Brennan: And Sofia I'll let you know, because I know that you have a ton of movement left, Tony will probably either get a swing on you at the end of his turn from a legendary or from an opportunity. So if you wanted to move on the, like, you see what I'm saying, like, he's gonna get a swing on you no matter what. So if you wanted to move, you probably could move as well."
Emily: I probably should move because now I'll be exhausted after that.
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: So yeah. I'm gonna jump away.
Brennan: Hell yeah. You jump away. Tony's gonna get a swing on you.
"Emily: Oh, Shield. I still have one more thing left."
Brennan: One more spell slot?
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Okay, he managed to push through the Shield but your AC is still up at Tony deals 16 points of damage to Sofia."
Emily: Still standing.
Brennan: Oh baby!
Lou: We love to see it.
"Brennan: We love to see it. Okay. That's Tony's last legendary. He's yeah, he's swaying. Buh-buh-bum… Okay, two Gramercy people are left. Their turn is now. Oh no, I had them go before Sofia."
Lou: Yes.
"Brennan: Yes, they already went, yep, yep, yep. Yes, yes, yes. We wanted it to be dramatic."
"Lou: [wagging a finger] Don't pull that, Brennan. Don't pull that, Brennan."
"Brennan: Pete, that is your turn."
"Ally: Okay, is there any way to try to get my voice back? Like..."
"Brennan: This is a status effect on you, you think probably a Lesser Restoration would do it."
"Ally: Okay, okay. Then I-"
"Murph: If you wait until, I don't know if I have it stocked actually, let me check. Could Lay Hands do it? You know how-"
"Brennan: Lay Hands could absolutely do it, yes."
Ally: Cool. Yeah?
"Murph: I can fix you up Pete, if you-"
"Ally: Baby, I will hold my turn."
"Brennan: Cool, Cody that's you."
Murph: Sweet. I am going to heal Pete with a fiery lozenge of hell fire.
"Pete: Don't, ah, it tastes like shit."
(all laugh)
"Cody: It's good though, it'll clear you out. Like sometimes cough drops, the ones that taste really bad are actually the ones that work the best."
[Ally laughs]
"Murph: Can I throw some healing in there as well, or do I just have to decide it's just a status effect."
"Brennan: Let me double check what lay on hands… ""As an action..."" (mumbles"
"quickly to himself) Must read the longest thing. ""Essentially..."" You can cure… You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with the single use Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.” I'm gonna say that allows you to do hit point healing as well as cure those effects."
"Murph: Great, how messed up are you, Pete?"
Ally: I'm actually okay right now.
"Murph: I might as well give you some, have you been hit?"
"Ally: Yeah, I'm missing maybe like 30 hit points. So that would be awesome."
Murph: I'll give you 30.
Ally: Incredible.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: And then let me go ahead and… Sofie's got that for the round. I'm gonna go ahead.
"Emily: Wait, what do I have?"
Brennan: Sofie's got a Shield for the round.
"Murph: I'm thinking in my head, you have a Shield."
"Emily: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Murph: I'm gonna hit Ricky with Shield of Faith.
"Zac: Oh wow, thank you."
Ally: Hell yeah.
Cody: Hell yeah.
"Ricky: Righteous, Cody."
Cody: Two sides of the same coin.
[Ally and Zac laugh]
"Sofia: That's a, Dale, that's a thing he says a lot. He's a hard guy to grapple with but he's got a good heart."
[Murph and Ally laugh]
"Brennan: Dale looks at him and goes like,"
"Dale: Huh, okay, yeah. He seems, umm…"
Camera flips to Murph smiling.
"Dale: Yeah, he seems like he puts a lot of effort forward."
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah. Which at first is like really confusing because he puts effort into like weird things sometimes, but he's really sweet."
"Dale: Gotcha, okay."
Murph: He's singing both sides of the Evanescence song to himself right now.
[Emily and Ally laugh]
"Cody: Wake me up inside, [higher octave] wake me up inside! Can’t wake up-- Save me from the nothing--"
Brennan: That's what you do when you're healing.
"Sofia: Again, that’s something that he's investing in."
"Brennan: You hear Lucifer shouting from Hell,"
"Lucifer: Dude, I forgot to mention I'm a Shinoda guy too!"
"Cody: Oh, dude!"
"Brennan: The… [humming] Eh, eh, eh… Cool, Pete, that's gonna be you."
"Ally: Cool, then I am going to cast Banishment on… this person top-right?"
Brennan: Oh shit! Okay.
Ally: And I'm going to cast it with Heightened Spell. So I add three sorcery points and they have disadvantage on this save.
Lou: Yeah!
"Brennan: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Three sorcery points and they have disadvantage. Holy shit. Okay, what we are gonna go ahead and do now, this person has one third level spell slot left. They need it for the Dispel Magic, but they also don't wanna be affected by this spell. I think, but they can see that you're heightening it too. Okay, they are gonna attempt to Counterspell even though that means-"
Siobhan: I Counterspell their Counterspell.
"Brennan: Well, shit. It's gone, baby."
Ally: Hell yeah!
"Brennan: Wait, so sorry, Siobhan, so sorry."
"Siobhan: Ah shit, did I already do it this round? Fuck."
"Brennan: You Counterspelled their last, one of their last Dispel Magic’s."
Siobhan: Goddamn!
"Zac: Even so, that's still good that they're Counterspelling versus Dispel Magic."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: That means that the person in the… Yes okay, cool. So they're gonna try to Counterspell this. It's heightened, they need a 14 or higher on this D20 to Counterspell."
"Ally: And is it disadvantage on this, do you think, or this… Oh, this is just a roll over a Counterspell."
"Brennan: Let me see what Heightened Spell says. 'Cause that's very cool. ♪ Buh-buh-bummm...♪ The saving throw will be rolled with disadvantage, but the counterspell will not. They still need a 14 or higher to counter."
"Ally: Cool. Hey, nice."
"Brennan: That's a seven, baby. Rolling two D20. Rolling two D20, lower of the rolls. It’s a two!"
Murph: Nice. You absolutely--
"Brennan: So here's what happens now, Pete, because this person right here, you'll notice was one of the only people not casting Banishment, was in fact being very careful not to cast any concentration spells. The reason for that being that they were already concentrating on a spell. And in fact, we're already concentrating on a Banishment spell and as Pete banishes them, who should appear? But Esther fucking Sinclair!"
(all cheering)
Brennan: At the bottom of the staircase.
Ricky: Babe!
[Ally and Murph laugh]
"Brennan: Incredible. However, I will… So Ricky loses Haste because Banishment is concentration."
"Ally: But I like straight up already, do I lose it if I get fully knocked out too?"
"Brennan: No, 'cause it's whether Pete gets knocked out."
"Zac: Oh. Do I lose my turn now, is that right? No."
"Ally: [covers their face] Oh shit, sorry."
Brennan: You do lose your turn now.
Emily: It’s good to get Esther back.
Siobhan: It’s good to get Esther back.
"Ally: I thought, yeah, sorry man. I forgot about that part of it"
"Brennan: Esther comes back, Pete, incredible turn. (buzzing lips) She looks around sees Tony."
"Ally: Was it, I'm so sorry, Zac."
Zac: It's okay.
"Ally: I was like, it's gonna suck 'cause he won't have haste anymore, but it'll be worth it."
"Zac: There’s like a billion spells. Yeah, it's fine."
"Ally: Yeah, Jesus."
"Brennan: Esther… (*zappy-boomy noise*) appears, you see she's fully, She is weeping hysterically. Looks over at you, Ricky, coming out of haste. Looks at all this chaos that's happening. Looks over at Sofia."
"Sofia: Kingston's not the only one who can cast Revivify, I guess."
"Brennan: You see, she looks at Dale. A lot has happened, but she comes out. She looks and goes (*bzzzoooohh*)"
Esther: What have you fucking done to my society?
"Brennan: Screams and then looks over at Ricky and goes, Ricky-"
Ricky: I saw the box of piss.
(all laugh)
Esther: What box of piss?
"Ricky: The box covered in piss. I, I, I understand!"
"Esther: It was, I disguised it as an illusion. Ricky, we're gonna, wait, how did you know that that was a pregnancy test?"
"Ricky: I just knew, I just knew."
"Brennan: You see, she starts bawling. Tony goes,"
"Tony: Oh, fucking knock it off!"
"Brennan: She starts bawling and she looks over and is like,"
"Esther: Ricky, I wish I could’ve, you could have found out some other way."
"Brennan: Holds the Staff of Sorrow in her hand and looks over at Tony and goes,"
"Esther: Oh fuck, this is so fucked up. You wouldn't like me when I'm sad."
"Brennan: And she holds the Staff of Sorrow aloft and is going to act very soon in the initiative order. However, right now after Cody and Pete, that's gonna be Tony."
"Emily: I mean, he's probably gonna call this all off, right? Because now the real First Fist is back."
Brennan: Yeah that's probably gonna happen for sure.
Emily: Like Dale's back so he can probably just go back to--
Ally: He seems like super reasonable.
Zac: Seems like a timeout scenario.
Ally: Yeah.
Siobhan: Orange slices.
Brennan: Tony is gonna take an attack on Ox.
"Emily: Yeah, 'cause he's trying not to get that opportunity attack."
"Zac: That sucks, that sucks."
Ally: 'Cause he's a little bitch--
Brennan: And deals--
"Sofia: Okay sorry, just walk me through this Tony, you hit a pregnant woman, now you go after a dalmatian."
"Ricky: After you kidnapped a pregnant woman, mind you."
[Emily and Brennan laugh]
"Sofia: I just wanna know because I know that you really believe in the righteousness of your cause, but like maybe sometimes you need to analyze some of the steps to get towards."
Brennan: You see--
Ricky: You're a weird shit-head.
Brennan: He deals 26 points of damage to Ox.
Zac: Fuck! Ox is dead.
"Brennan: He crushes Ox's head under his foot. He goes,"
"T: Laugh it up all you fucking want. All of you were lying. You had a way to protect New York, you had a way to cut off the dream world, and none of you had what it fucking took to do it. I'm gonna send all of you straight to a fucking early grave. And this city is gonna be safe."
Brennan: And he hits Ox with his first attack is going to move here. Gonna hit Pete with an attack.
Ally: Oh Jeez.
Emily: Will Dale get an opportunity attack?
"Brennan: No, Dale was not within five feet."
"Ally: I think Shield, right? I don't think I've used…"
"Murph: Yeah, why not?"
"Ally: Bend luck or anything. Shield, to add, now I'm at 18 AC."
"Brennan: He's clear as an 18. He deals 24 points of damage to Pete. He's mostly, it's clear he's mostly doing this because he has the Mobile feat. So he's trying to get past people and not get attacks of opportunity. He hits Cody for, eight, 19 points of damage to Cody."
"Murph: Cool, I'm gonna Hellish Rebuke."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and roll damage."
"Murph: ...19 damage. Let me see. I guess I'll just do first… Yeah, I'll just do first level. Eh, fuck it, second level."
Ally: Is he going for Esther?
Brennan: Unclear right now.
"Ricky: Light him up Cody, light him up."
Cody: I'm absolutely trying.
"Murph: So he has, oh, he's gonna just have a dex save. I'll just do first level, sorry I keep flip-flopping. So just 2d10. That's a big six damage."
Brennan: Six damage. He's gonna roll a dex save. He takes no damage.
"(*the classic ""takes no damage* hand motion & sound effect*)"
Murph: Great. I tried.
"Brennan: Pete, sorry, I'm gonna need you to roll concentration, actually."
Murph: You have plus four from being next to-
Brennan: Next to Cody.
"Emily: Yes, oh, that's good."
"Ally: Aye, that is a 21 plus whatever con, so 27 actually."
"Brennan: I think actually as yet, actually as Tony sees that concentration on you he's gonna try to beat that concentration out of you."
"Lou: God, this guy sucks."
[Brennan laughs]
"Emily: Again, like I said before I think that we actually will kill this one. I just, he does not deserve to be reunited."
Brennan: I'm gonna need some saving throws. I'm gonna need a… I'm gonna need a strength saving throw from Cody and I'm gonna need a dex
saving throw from Pete.
Ally: Okay. My dex is plus three.
Murph: I got an 18.
Brennan: 18? He flings you 15 feet away from him.
Murph: Fuck!
"Emily: Oh, okay."
"Brennan: Yeah, no, he does not throw you into the engine. He throws you (*getting thrown sound effect*) just kicks you up against the wall over here."
Ally: 21 on my dex.
"Brennan: 21 on your dex, you do not go prone. He's gonna hit you again. That is a hit."
Ally: Even with Shield? I'm at 18.
"Brennan: Even with Shield, yep. That's gonna be 26 points of damage."
(*health bar lowering sound effect*)
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: I'm gonna need a DC13 concentration check here.
"Ally: Okay, my con is plus six."
"Brennan: Or DC13 concentration, yeah."
Ally: Come on. All right.
"Ally rolls a natural 16 which adds up to a 19, making the save."
[Murph claps]
"Brennan: Hell, yeah! But, I'm gonna need one more DC19 dex, and then a DC15 con."
Lou: Woo!
Murph: Good Lord.
Lou: Much too much.
"Ally: My Lord, okay, dex is plus three. Oh, failed the dex."
"Brennan: Okay, you go prone. So he knocks you to the ground."
Ally: Okay. And then this is the concentration.
"Brennan: This is the stun 'cause he hit you twice. So this is the stun, this is the important one."
"Ally: Okay, and this is a, what? A con?"
"Brennan: This is con, yeah."
"Ally: Okay, six plus six, aye, 25."
Murph: Nice.
"Emily: Wow, yes!"
Brennan: Pete is not going down baby.
Ally: Lost a couple feathers.
(all laugh)
"Brennan: Incredible. Ricky, you lose your turn. JJ."
Ally: Once again I am so sorry.
"Zac: No, it's okay, it's fine."
Ally: I'm really sorry.
Zac: It was good to have those attacks early.
"Ally: I always forget about that part of Haste though. It's really not the gift I thought it was, I'm just like goddamn it."
"Zac: No, I mean, I forget too."
Emily: It is though.
"Brennan: JJ looks up at you, Kingston and makes the motion to you if you're okay with him moving Blur to somebody else."
"Lou: I say,"
"Kingston: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, all good."
Emily: Blur on Pete.
"Brennan: Yeah, actually, he's gonna do blur on Pete. You see (*magic blast noise*), he hits you with a bunch of like computer-- Pete. You are fully pixelated, you're (*pixelated sound*) As he hits you with this like blur effect."
Emily: So Pete is pixelated with a feather beard and an umbilical cord connecting to Sofia.
"Brennan: Correct, that is correct."
Zac: Is Sofie pixelated now?
Siobhan: Having a normal one.
Ally: Just a New York minute.
Siobhan: Aren’t you glad you’re sober
"Brennan: Rowan, that's going to be you."
"Siobhan: Sofia, are you really low hit points?"
"Emily: I'm at three, but I do have a level of exhaustion--"
"Siobhan: So, how would you feel about having 157 hit points?"
"Emily: All right, I don't even think mechanically I can but sure."
Siobhan: What about if I cast Polymorph on you and turn you into a giant ape.
(Emily laughs)
"Emily: Sure, yeah, why not?"
Ally: Incredible.
Murph: Holy shit!
"Siobhan: I do that, I'll text you the stats."
Emily: Dale always had a crush on Donkey Kong's girlfriend.
(all laughing)
"Siobhan: Yes she does, I'm going to cast Polymorph so that she does have little pig tails."
Lou: You mean like Dixie Kong?
"Ally: I was just trying to Google, I was like what the fuck was her name?"
"Siobhan: Yes, she looks exactly like Dixie Kong."
"Kingston: Yo, is that Dixie Kong?"
"Brennan: Hold on, before we have a lot of fun with this, I have to be terrible. One second."
Siobhan: No!
"Brennan: Mage Slayer reaction, that is a hit. Rowan you take, ooh, you take 26 points of damage as Tony hits you. And I'm going to need, go ahead and roll in front of the board, what is your bonus to constitution?"
"Siobhan: Plus two, but I have War Magic so I have advantage."
Brennan: It's not concentration.
"Siobhan: Oh, okay, so plus two."
"Brennan: Oh, well, do you have a concentration spell active right now?"
Siobhan: Polymorph is concentration.
"Brennan: Gotcha, okay. So there's actually gonna be two rolls involved here."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: The first thing is, you know, actually there wouldn't be two. It's still just one. You don't get advantage on this. You had a plus two to this roll, and then you had a plus four because of Cody, right?"
"Siobhan: Yes, so plus six."
"Murph: Oh, great."
Ally: Incredible.
Brennan: I need you to hit a 13 or higher as you go to cast that spell.
Siobhan: All right.
Brennan: Let's go ahead and roll in front of the board.
Siobhan: Fuck!
(overlapping crosstalk)
"Ally: Bend Luck? No, I used shield."
Brennan: You used Shield.
Siobhan: I don't have Shield.
"Emily: He has Mage Slayer, doesn't he? Is that why?"
Brennan: He has Mage Slayer.
"Emily: Oh, of course you do."
"Brennan: This guy is built to kill magic. He's spent his whole life. Rowan, you go to cast that spell and he grabs your wrist breaks it and breaks all four of the fingers on that hand, preventing you from casting somatic components into your spells."
"Siobhan: I have War Caster, so I can still cast somatic components even if I'm carrying things."
"Brennan: This, I don't think would cover that. This is similar to what happened with Pete, when he crushed Pete's windpipe. Let me double check here. Yeah, this is you can, the wording of War Caster is you can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands. That's basically the dexterity of being able to carry things while casting spells. This is, he's shattered your hand."
Siobhan: What things do I have that don't have somatic components?
Emily: He is such a fuck.
"Siobhan: Did I, wait, but I still cast the spell though, right?"
"Brennan: No, that's him countering, that's Mage Slayer. He's reacting to you casting the spell, breaking your hand, countering the spell."
"Siobhan: I can't Counterspell his Counterspell, that doesn't do anything? No, well, shit. All right."
"Brennan: Any bonus actions from Rowan there? Oh sorry, this is on you turn still, you do still have your reaction..."
"Siobhan: Yes, so I guess I'll, I'll say to Sofia,"
"Rowan: I'm still gonna get you and honestly you're glowing right now. It suits you, you're glowing."
Sofia: [beaming] My dead husband just came back to life and we're gonna raise a fucking child together.
"Rowan: And like I don't wanna be a creep about it, but like good job on that husband."
Sofia: [laughing] He's really fucking hot.
"Brennan: This is, Esther is going to take a move action to get towards the engine, to try and fix it. She rushes forward ready and seeing Ricky, Ricky, she doubles up and as she did in the final battle three years ago, cast Haste on you. (buzzes lips)"
Lou: Here we go again.
"Zac: Does that, I can...? Okay. Does that undo...?"
"Brennan: It does not undo, actually, no, it does not."
"Murph: But you only lost one turn anyway, right? You're already missed your turn. It was already gone, so now you’re just Hasted again."
"Brennan: At the end of Rowan's turn, Tony is gonna make an attack with disadvantage on Pete. You cast Shield, right, that's still active on you?"
Ally: [nods] Yep.
"Brennan: Because of the disadvantage and shield, Tony misses."
Emily: Yeah! So much magic.
"Pete: There's so much magic. Well, it seems like everyone's magic and it's working."
(all laughing)
"Pete: Except for one person, who seems not to like the magic."
Sofia: It's so fucked up 'cause I gave you the opportunity to get your wife back.
"Brennan: He screams at you, that looks like it's fucking with him, that you keep saying that. Kingston that's gonna be you."
"Lou: Okay, there's one, there's another, there's still that one person. And they can still stop this. Or they could still set it off."
Brennan: The person that Alejandro is next to can still set this off.
Lou: Does grappling somebody prevent them from doing somatic components in spellcasting?
"Brennan: No, it does not."
Lou: Great.
"Cody: The moped'll make it Kingston, the moped can fucking make it, dude."
Zac: Can I hold up my arm?
"Lou: Yeah, I'd like to ride-"
Emily: Like you're hailing a taxi?
Lou: I'd like to grab-
Zac: Just grab the side of the moped.
"Lou: Kingston can barely process that Dale is here, but New York is on the line. So I'm gonna drive, I'd love to grab Ricky if possible, and take the moped's full movement to get as close to that last wizard as possible."
"Brennan: Cody, what's the speed on the moped?"
"Murph: With a dash action, it'll be 120 feet."
Brennan: Let me just see kind of loosely if that's--
"Murph: He might have to hop off and run like 10 feet, but it is damn close to getting him all the way there."
Zac: If you just get me close enough. Get me close-ish and that's helpful. But also do whatever you want (chuckling).
"Lou: No, you're coming."
[Emily laughs]
Murph: Oh yeah.
Lou: I'm gonna get you there.
Brennan: That'll get you to the bottom of the stairs baby.
Lou: Great.
Murph: Or top of the stairs.
"Brennan: Top, yeah. Kingston..."
Lou: Whatever the stairs are.
"Brennan: Kingston, if you wanna ride by and grab Ricky, go for it."
"Lou: Hell yes. I swing by, pick up Ricky. I put you on my shoulders, but you know, that's your own business, not mine."
Zac: I'm just like knocked out just on your shoulders.
"Kingston: You got this, come on Ricky, come on."
"Lou: And we're gonna go all the way there. And then I'm gonna cast, I'm gonna cast Command on this last wizard."
Emily: Oh.
Brennan: Oh shit!
Ally: Yes.
Lou: So DC17 wisdom saving throw.
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Oh shit!
Brennan: This wizard is first gonna try a Counterspell. They got the slots left. Counterspell.
"Lou: I casted at a higher, no I didn't know that, so go ahead, yep. They can go ahead and try and counter. I think they can."
"Brennan: Oh yes, first level. Yeah, it's first level spell. They hit it with a Counterspell (buzzes lips)."
"Lou: I goddamn hate these wizards. All right. Great, great."
Brennan: But Kingston and Ricky are over here at the top of the stairs. That is Counterspell. (buzzes lips) Alejandro's turn.
"Lou: Great, and there's no amount of violence. Okay, well, yeah, he'll just swing on them. Great, let's go. Crit twice, come on Alejandro. The first one is a 17 to hit."
Brennan: 17 hits.
"Lou: Right, great. That's gonna be 15 damage."
"Brennan: 15 damage, okay."
"Lou: Second one, that's gonna be, that's gonna be 20, mod. And 17 more damage and he'll take 17 hit points."
"Brennan: Wait, how much damage has Alejandro just dealt?"
Lou: 17 and--
Brennan: The first attack was 15.
Lou: 17 and 15.
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: 32.
Brennan: 32.
Lou: 32.
Brennan: This wizard is looking so hurt right now.
Lou: Goddamn it!
"Brennan: Is looking so, so hurt right now. Okay, this is gonna be the Concrete Fist. These four are going to wail on Alejandro."
Murph: Oh jeez.
"Brennan: That's two hits on Alejandro. Alejandro takes 17 plus eight, takes 25 points of damage. These Concrete Fist are going to come to Tony. And actually at the end of Kingston's turn, Tony is gonna take another legendary disadvantage on Pete, misses. These Concrete Fist are going to, what are they gonna do? This one is going to step in here. We're gonna get four attacks with disadvantage on Pete. That's a miss. That's a miss. What is your AC, 18 right now?"
Ally: 18.
"Brennan: That's a miss. That's a hit, last one's gonna step in as well."
"Rowan: Tony, you've done a bad job training these boys."
"Brennan: That's a miss, only one hit."
Ally: Wow.
"Brennan: Pete takes 12 points of damage, give me a DC 10 concentration check."
Murph: Come on Pete.
Ally rolls a nat 2.
Brennan: Ooh!
Murph: That one was out of spells though for this spell.
Brennan: That one was out of spells.
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Okay. (buzzes lips) You lose Banishment. This is, it's Dale and Sofia."
"Emily: Okay, I'm just going to, I think that I'm just gonna fucking go after… Ah, should I go for this? No, 'cause they don't have any spells. I think I'm just gonna go after Tony."
Murph: That’s smart.
Zac: Hell yeah.
Emily: I have a disadvantage 'cause I'm exhausted.
Murph: That’s on checks.
Emily: But because of Dale I have advantage. Oh really?
"Siobhan: Yeah, it's not an attack."
"Murph: Are checks the same as, not an attack."
"Brennan: Yeah, it's only ability checks, it's not attacks. You don't have disadvantage on attacks."
Murph: You still have advantage.
"Emily: Okay, so I'm definitely gonna Flurry of Blows. So that's technically gonna be rolling. That's technically gonna be rolling. So if I'm hitting four times twice, that'll be rolling eight. Oh, I crit, one of those is a Hexblade crit."
Siobhan: Yes!
Brennan: Oh my God!
"Emily: Okay, first one is a Hexblade crit, second one is a miss, third one is a hit-- The great one is a hit."
"Brennan: Wait, hold on how are you? Okay, you're rolling."
Murph: They're next to each other in the math of the side.
"Emily: Oh, right, right, right. So, oh yeah you're right. Okay, so the first one is a hex blade crit, the second one is a hit as well, the third one is a hit as well, and the fourth one is a hit."
Murph: 'Cause it's 10-
Emily: 'Cause 19 plus three is 22.
"Brennan: Yep, absolutely, it's exactly a hit."
"Emily: Okay, so I hit four times, which means that I do, and I'm actually, since I'm at three hit points, I'm doing an extra D8 radiant with everything."
"Brennan: This is going to be for four attacks, and he's also still under your Hexblade curse. So Sofia here's what you're rolling. You're rolling 6d8 plus 2d6. You get four for Hexblade plus three from Magic Weapon is seven plus five is 12. You're rolling 6d8 plus… No, one of them is a crit, right?"
"Emily: Yeah, one of them is a crit."
"Brennan: Sorry, so here's the fullness of what you're rolling, right? You are rolling. Not 6d8. You are rolling 8d8 plus 2d6 plus 48."
(all laughing)
Murph: Oh my God.
Lou: Plus 48?
"Brennan: You are rolling 8d8 plus 2d6 plus 48, right? Because think about it's--"
"Emily: 'Cause my Hexblade Curse adds plus four, each time."
Brennan: Dale's spell adds three each time to seven and you get a normal--
"Emily: Oh, I wasn’t even doing that the first time."
"Brennan: And you get a normal plus, so each attack is plus 12. So it's 8d8, plus 2d6 plus 48."
Emily: Okay.
"Ally: Wow, wow."
(laughter)
Zac: I thought 90 damage was a lot.
"Lou: Yeah, here we were..."
"Sofia: Yeah, you just honestly, Ricky get married. It does amazing things for your damage."
"Ricky: Okay, yeah."
"Brennan: Sofia, you rush past Dale, he gives you a sweet kiss on the cheek as you rush by. You do 97 points of damage to Tony Simos. What does Sofia Lee do to finish off this false First Fist of the order?"
"Emily: I think that I'm gonna drag him by the neck, put his swaying corpse in front of me and Dale and give a really beautiful sweet kiss to Dale. So the last thing he saw is someone who by the power of dreams was reunited with their spouse."
[Ally and Siobhan laugh]
"Brennan: He watches that. Dale looks up at him as he's tottered, you've completely, he's tottering, he's done. You have just a flurry pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa. Dale kisses you so passionately and yet sweetly. And then turns to Tony and says,"
"Dale: I didn't know it either. But sometimes Tony, it really is what it could be."
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: And you kick Tony, he flies into the umbral engine (buzzes lips) and disappears into the vastness of time. Tony Simos is defeated!"
Emily: Yes!
[Murph and Zac clap]
"Rowan: Bye, bitch. Barely knew you."
"Sofia: A real quick check in with everyone, sorry, should I have shown him mercy?"
[Brennan laughs]
Ricky: Absolutely not.
Kingston: Nah.
Sofia: I just feel like when he killed the dalmatian… I really tried to redeem him several times.
"Kingston: The amount of times he attacks pregnant women, I think we're good on that."
Rowan: If somebody tells you who they are believe them.
Kingston: It should be zero. His was two. That's crazy.
"Ricky: Two, and then one of those there's a bunch of many times in between."
"Cody: And then the dog, he attacked a dog. That was fucked up."
Pete: Oh yeah!
Ricky: It's good that he doesn't exist anymore.
"Sofia: Okay, cool."
"Cody: Wait, I'm sorry, who's Tony?"
Sofia: Also like Heather Simos is gonna come back young and hot. She's fine.
"Rowan: Yeah, she doesn't wanna be dating some like 50 year old when she's like 22."
"Brennan: That's gonna be eight, nine plus four, Dale Lays on Hands for 21 points of damage to you Sofia."
"Sofia: Hun, you are being really way too sweet right now."
"Dale: No, I've been dead for so many years, I'm back."
"Sofia: I know, I know, I know."
"Dale: I'm sorry, I'll be, I know your friends are here."
"Sofia: I'm just saying if you wanna throw a couple punches, you've fucking earned it and you're the fuckin' First Fist again."
"Dale: Okay, I'll go ham."
"Brennan: You see, he smiles. That is this final Gramercy wizard's turn. This wizard has their last spell slot. I don't see anyone. Yeah, they go to cast Dispel Magic on the umbral engine for the final--"
Zac: And then I Counterspell it.
[the crowd goes wild]
"Emily: Yeah, you fucking do! Yeah, you fucking do!"
Brennan: Oh my God! Oh my fucking God!
Zac: It's my last Counterspell.
Brennan: Oh my God! Ricky you hold Esther's bat up in your hand and save New York.
(all laughing)
Ally: Get out! Oh my God!
(*lil buzz noise*)
"Zac: It just, kinda like, is so weak. I just hold it up and it just kind of pings off of it, like I drop the bat and go ting, ting, ting, ting, ting."
"Brennan: A little thing appears here then says like, bunt!"
(all laugh)
"Brennan: Esther goes,"
"Esther: Yeah, sweetie, yes!"
"Brennan: Incredible. Holy shit! This other Gramercy person is going to, what the fuck can they even do? They go to cast Scorching Ray and Esther fucking Counterspells it. And does one of these at the fucking traitor wizard. She's like,"
Esther: Jessica--
"Brennan: Wait no, that's Siobhan's daughter's name. She goes like,"
"Esther: Beth, it's your ass."
(all laugh)
Zac: How fucked up would it be if you just revealed that it's Jessica?
"Brennan: It's Jessica, she's the… Oh my God, she is so terrible."
"Lou: Oh, thank God, Iga is not here."
Emily: She was in spirit though. The Counterspell she put in my leopard print.
"Brennan: There you go, that's right. Yes, yes, yes. Pete, that is your turn again."
Ally: I guess--
"Brennan: And there's only one last wizard, you guys are, well, there's two, there's one up on the staircase. But Tony's defeated, there are these, there's a lot of monks left, but Tony is fucking gone."
"Ally: You know, I guess I'll just Fireball these guys in front of me with Careful Spell."
"Brennan: Remember your throat’s crushed, so you gotta use, you have to use Subtle Spell on every spell that you're--"
"Lou: No, Lay on Hands."
Murph: Not anymore.
Emily: Lay on Hands.
"Brennan: Oh, not anymore."
Murph: Lay Hands.
"Brennan: Yeah Fireball, baby, go for it. Yes, yes, yes, Careful Spell."
"Ally: Yeah, so we're gonna do, we're gonna do the 10d6 Fireball with my last fifth level. Let me double check that math. No, we're gonna do fourth level Fireball. 9d6 on this little guy."
"Brennan: Incredible. What a great fight. I can't believe, this was a hard fucking fight. Tony's one of the hardest monsters I've ever made. And you guys, ooh!"
Siobhan: Hard as nails!
"Zac: He had 15 attacks, it was crazy."
(all laugh)
Siobhan: How many times he hit...
Brennan: 31.
"Ally: Cool, 31 to to these guys."
"Brennan: The guy with red hair (buzzes lips) goes down. The other two are badly, badly injured."
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: Amazing. Awesome, Pete that is your turn, Cody, that's you."
Murph: Sweet.
"Cody: Modell's versus Hot Topic, a tale as old as time."
Murph: I go forward at these dudes and I'm going to make two attacks.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
"Murph: Yeah, 'cause I can't, I can't get anywhere without my moped. Okay, that is 20 to hit."
"Brennan: 20 hits, absolutely."
Murph: Sweet. I will do a second level smite.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: So that'll be, so I’ll roll 2d6... plus 4d8? It's 3d8 plus… yeah."
"Brennan: Yeah 4d8, so 2d6 plus 4d8 plus whatever you add."
Murph: Plus 10 now.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: 32.
"Brennan: Gone, baby! (buzzes lips)"
Murph: Nice.
Brennan: Toast.
Murph: And then I'll go for the last dude over here.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: That is only, that one's only a 14."
"Brennan: 14, so that guy is looking hurt, hurt, hurt, but not down yet."
"Murph: Oh, sorry, it was 14 to hit."
"Brennan: Oh, 14 does not hit, no."
"Murph: Okay, cool. Is there anything I want to do with the bonus action? I think maybe not."
Ally: I could try to Bend Luck on that 14.
"Murph: [considers it] It's up to you. There might be bigger things, but also maybe not."
"Ally: Maybe, yeah. I can't tell."
"Brennan: I'm gonna say we'll resolve that there and to keep moving. Ricky, that's your turn."
"Zac: Ricky is just gonna stand up, grab the bat, and be like,"
"Ricky: Are we, hey, can we, are we done? I feel like we're done, right?"
[Brennan laughs]
Sofia: I think we need to get that final wizard. And also there's these three monks which...
Ricky: Yeah.
"Zac: I think Ricky is gonna go up to, how far is this?"
"Brennan: Ricky, if you wanna try to make an intimidation check to get these people to surrender. You're welcome to do so."
Ally: Ooh!
"Zac: You know what, I'll intimidate them by hitting them with the bat."
(all laugh)
"Brennan: Yeah, there we go, very good. Great, great, great. Go for it."
Zac: I'm gonna go over here. And just take some cracks.
Brennan: Go for it.
"Zac: All right, so first attack is a… Oh, that's plus… 19 to hit."
Brennan: 19 hits.
"Zac: Second attack, 22 to hit, and that's just two attacks on the first guy. Really low on spells at this point, I think. I think I actually used two of those… I'll use, sorry, one second. What is it, a 1d8, so I'm gonna use a Divine Smite on the first attack. So that's 3d8 with improved-"
Brennan: Yes.
Zac: Okay. So 3d8 plus seven--
"Brennan: Or it should be it's 4d8 including your weapon. 'Cause 1d8 for the weapon improved, so 4d8 plus 1d6 because of the bat"
"Zac: Two, right? 'Cause I have two spells on me. I've Haste and oh wait, nevermind, Cody's spell's different."
"Brennan: Yeah, Cody's spell's different."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: So yeah, four D8 plus one D6 plus whatever you add, yep. Hell yeah."
Zac: Sorry.
"Brennan: 32, or is-? Yeah."
"Zac: Plus seven, this is just the first hit, 34. How's that?"
"Brennan: Oh, fucked up badly."
"Zac: Okay, second attack. I'm not gonna use the Divine Smite on this one. I feel like..."
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure."
Zac: Maybe not. So that would be 2d8 or 3d8?
"Brennan: Yeah, that's two D8 plus one D6 plus seven."
Zac: That's not gonna hit. Is he still standing?
"Brennan: Yes, still standing."
Zac: Oh shit! all right.
Brennan: But looking extremely low on hit points.
Zac: I'm gonna roll my last attack.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: That hits and we'll do that one more time. Another 21 damage.
"Brennan: Down, boom! You wah, wah, wah, leap down to that platform. That is your turn. JJ."
Lou: JJ...
Brennan: JJ is gonna fire a Magic Missile at the monk that's still fighting his restraints. And hits him for 10 points of damage.
"Kingston: There you go, JJ."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Kingston: There you go.
"Brennan: Incredible, that's going to be Rowan, that is you."
"Siobhan: This guy's looking pretty fucked up, right? This monk right here."
"Brennan: Very fucked up, yes."
"Siobhan: Okay. I'm going to and he's restrained, did you say? So I get advantage on an attack roll against him?"
"Brennan: That is, that one right there? No, he's not restrained."
"Siobhan: Oh, okay, cool. Anyway, I'm gonna cast blinding smite, which does not require somatic components."
"Brennan: Oh, hell yes."
"Siobhan: And I'm gonna attack him with my rapier, which is a 21 to hit."
"Brennan: 21 hits, go ahead and roll damage."
"Siobhan: Great, so that's Four D8 plus four. Twenty six."
Brennan: The queen of Faerie land from the air draws a scintillating silver blade and stabs this dude through the fucking head.
Rowan: I blinded you by killing you. You're welcome.
(all laughing)
Cody: Technically a blinding spell
Ricky: How Shakespearean.
(all laugh)
"Brennan: Incredible. That is going to be Esther's turn. Esther is going to cast baleful polymorph. This wizard up here, needs to roll a 14 or higher to resist this. See how they do. That's an 11. Esther turns to the wizard on the stairs and is like,"
"Esther: you're gonna explain what you did to this place and in my time, not your time."
"Brennan: And turns that person into a statue, just (*bloomp*). And petrifies the wizard up on the staircase. Gone. That's Esther's turn."
Ricky: Awesome statue.
Esther: Thank you-
Rowan: Very cool!
"Esther: Thank you sweetheart. The bat is honestly, I'm so glad someone's using it. I love it, you look great."
"Ricky: I love it, thank you for letting me use it."
"Siobhan: I text Ricky. “There's some really beautiful jewelry shops in Faerie, if you wanna come visit with me later.”"
(laughter)
"Ricky: What, what is that about?"
Brennan: Kingston that's your turn.
"Lou: Can I make the same, can I make the intimidation check?"
Brennan: Yeah go for it.
Lou: For a surrender.
"Brennan: Yep, go for it."
"Lou: Ah, that'll be a 19."
Brennan: I think on a 19 Kingston you bellow out for them to surrender. Looks like this last monk and this last wizard are true believers. You're gonna have to clean them up the old fashioned way.
Lou: Okay. Can I take like a quick step like five feet to this side and throw down a lightning bolt that kinda like threads the needle between Ricky and Alejandro.
"Brennan: You absolutely may, yes, a hundred percent."
"Lou: We'll do that, we'll make it a fourth level lightning bolt, just toss it right down there."
Murph: Beautiful.
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: These are their saves.
Rolls a one and a two
abysmal saves.
"Lou: That won't do at all. Okay, backslash roll nine D6. That's a B, six, right? Oh, and there's another L in roll. Nine, backslash roll nine B6 There you go."
(all cheering)
"Emily: Six, six, six, Cody is coming through."
Kingston: What's dude-  Cody!
"Cody: ♪ Wake me up, wake me up. ♪"
Pete: ♪ Save me! ♪
(laughter drowns out speaker)
Kingston: What song is on this moped? I'm into this!
(laughter)
Brennan: Go ahead-
Murph: Only plays that song.
"Brennan: Kingston, the last wizard you are facing is fried."
(buzzes lips)
As lightning extends from your hand. Go ahead and roll Alejandro's attack rolls.
"Lou: Okay. And I also send this moped back to Cody. That first one is gonna be a, it's gonna be a 12."
Brennan: 12 misses.
"Lou: Oh, the second one is a 20, mod."
Brennan: 20 hits.
Lou: Great. And that's gonna be nine damage and Ricky you get nine hit points.
"Zac: Hey, look at that."
Lou: Nine temporary hit points.
"Brennan: Incredible. This monk is gonna try to finish off Alejandro right now. Alejandro's armor class is 16. That's two hits. Alejandro takes nine, 10, 13 plus 8 is 21 points of damage"
Lou: Still up.
Brennan: Ooh!
Zac: I'm glad that Ricky was very pained by not being able to take the blow for the angel that wouldn't die anyway but...
"Brennan: The guy behind Kingston is still restrained by spirits of the city. He has failed every single roll on his turn to get out. Dale is going to fly across,"
(Sofia laughing)
"leap across the room and be like,"
"Dale: hun, I'm gonna go take you up on your offer."
"Sofia: Absolutely, I'm dying to see you in action."
"Brennan: He goes and helps that Concrete Fist monk up out of his restraints and says, “hey buddy, come on up out of there.” And he says, “I don't wanna hit"
"you while you're restrained.” And then, but he's going to… And now Dale's gonna go… But you know what, he'll still take the advantage mechanically."
(overlapping chatter)
Ally: He's no angel.
"Brennan: He's no angel. Let's go ahead and roll two D20 here, that's his first attack with advantage."
Rolls a five and a two
"Ooh, sorry Dale."
"Lou: He's rusty, he's rusty."
(overlapping chatter)
Sofia: It's okay hun.
"Brennan: And then he goes like, and then he's gonna roll his second attack with advantage."
Rolls a fifteen and a seventeen
"Siobhan: There we go, yeah!"
"Lou: Okay, there we go."
"Brennan: That's a little bit better my dude. He lays into, this dude for One- buh-bum-buh-bum That's that, and then five, 10, 16, 24, 31 points of damage. WHAM!"
Emily: Yeah!
"Dale: Ooh, haven't punched someone in a long time, my goodness."
"Brennan: Incredible. Sofia, that's you."
"Emily: Cool, I think there's no one else around me, right? I think I'm gonna go, I think it's adorable, so I'm gonna go help my husband."
(laughter)
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Sofia: See, this is what I was talking about the world was missing out on."
"Emily: And I do have to use step of the wind to do it, so I don't have a bonus"
"action but I do have, I do have two attacks with advantage."
Brennan: You're in the wife-guy aura.
Emily: Wife-guy aura.
Lou: Within the wife-guy aura.
"Emily: Okay, so I'm guessing. So the lowest one is a six, plus three plus nine so 18."
"Brennan: We'll pair them so that's an 11. Yeah, it's an 11 and a 17."
"Emily: Wait, wait, wait."
Brennan: You hit both times so go ahead and roll damage.
"Emily: Okay, great. Okay. So that is, oh, I'm healed though now, so it's just two D8."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: Oh no, it's, wow, I rolled two ones. I don't even fucking care. Let's see, five radiant plus two, five plus two, seven plus 10 for both attacks, so 17"
"Brennan: Buh-buh-bum, hold on one second."
Emily: I will burn a ki point to try and stun him.
Brennan: Sure.
"Emily: Not that we, I mean, we were already rolling with advantage."
"Brennan: He's stunned, baby, he's done. Pete, that's you."
"Ally: Oh great. I am going to… Prrah-at-da-taaahh… I'm pretty far from everyone but, yeah, I mean, I guess I'm just gonna take a full dash."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: And get here.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Can I try to yell an intimidation check?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Ally: I have pretty good intimidation. All right, it's plus nine to this."
"Brennan: Yeah, we'll call it a DC 25."
Lou: Ooh.
"Brennan: Hey baby, that's 26."
"Ally: Hell yeah, That's 26, honey!"
"Brennan: Pete, what do you say to these loyalists anti-dream Concrete Fist monks that are left here?"
"Ally: Okay, so I'm currently attached by an umbilical cord to Sofia and her dead husband is back and we're all just kind of glowing."
Emily: And you have a feather beard.
"Ally: And I have a feather beard. I think I'd twist my feather beard and be like,"
Pete: (Old wizard voice) you all have been chosen to join the right side.
(all laughing)
"Brennan: Both of these last monks collapse to their knees, one of them in front of Dale and Sofia, another one in front of Ricky and Alejandro."
"Pete: Come, come into the fold."
"Brennan: They listen to feather-beard Merlin. They don't know why, but they do."
(Sofia laughing at Ally Featherbeardsley)
"Pete: I was born in the magic, formed by it."
"Brennan: You guys come out of initiative. You have saved Gramercy. Esther, (buzzes lips) undoes the damage (buzzes lips), slows down the umbral engine, (*zzzzaps*) 500, 400, 250, 150% And doesn't seem to be able to move it lower than that. She reaches into the machine, yanks a literal like arcane USB drive out of the machine, that says Gladiator Industries on the side, crushes it in her hand. Kingston, you remember finding a subway entrance for the Central Park North Station. You found it up in Harlem. It is waiting for you there."
"Kingston: Great. I know Dale, holy shit."
"Dale: Kingston, hi, everyone. I'm, wait you see he goes, Rick, oh my God, buddy. Gives you a big, he's like, hey man, he's like, he goes like, hey ah, ah. Esther says, congratulations, dad."
(Brennan laughing)
"Ricky: I know, I guess I'm a bat dad now."
"Dale: Hey, there you go, oh my God."
"Sofia: Not to mention, Kingston is also expecting."
"Kingston: It's a dragon so it's not similar. No one had to pee on candy for me, but I will have, we already talked- me and Sof, we talk about it. We're gonna be doing play dates. Your angel child, my dragon child, and I guess Ricky's, whatever we assume is a near perfect child, though it is human. Well, it's gonna be a regular trio. Anyway, I found the horde, I think with the egg, but the umbra kept me from realizing it, it's on the North side of Central Park. I don't know what needs to be done here but when we are ready to go, it's there waiting for us."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You guys look around. Kingston, Alejandro is still around, he's hurt. You guys rescued Esther, Esther's got the staff of sorrow, she's like,"
"Esther: okay, let's do this. She looks and says, Sofia, you're pregnant too?"
Sofia: Oh yeah.
Ricky: I forgot y'all never linked up ago.
"Sofia: Downtime, I'm fucking pregnant with a fucking angel baby. It's the whole reason I fucking freaked out had to get Dale back."
"Esther: I was freaking out. I was late and I didn't say anything. I was like, 'cause I don't know because Kugrash broke the curse on my family, but I wasn't sure if he only broke it on just me and I started freaking out because I thought is my child gonna go back to like my grandma and become the fury of despair? It's crazy to have a child in the Unsleeping City. I'm like very nervous about it."
Sofia: I bet it's crazy in the real world too. I really do.
"Brennan: She's like “who would know?” So you guys now are rocking with three generations of Gramercy wizards right now. You've got angel Alejandro,"
"Esther, and young JJ, who wasn't hurt it all, but is like, woooo! You guys all can tell JJ just double leveled up. He like, he's set so- he's like a, being around you guys is so crazy for him XP-wise."
Zac: We're just power leveling JJ.
"Lou: What's up dude, we got you. We're gonna farm you out JJ."
"Siobhan: Just fucking grinding, JJ."
"Brennan: Incredible, and you also see Cody with this, the questing blade is this incredible black infernal like demon rune-covered thing. Does anyone have any status effects left over from the battle?"
Siobhan: Moi.
Lou: I'll heal that up.
Brennan: So if someone wants to drop five hit points of a lay on hands would...
"Zac: Oh, I can do that, yeah."
"Siobhan: Thank you, thank you."
"Brennan: Esther looks and says, “okay.” She's like,"
"Esther: those Gramercy traitors got the jump on me. So I got sealed away in a pocket dimension. So I haven't been injured, I have all my spells minus, a haste and a polymorph but, do we need to go right now? Things are far from okay. We stopped Gladiator's program on the umbral engine, but they've still pushed more raw umbra into the city than there has ever been before. If we're worried at all about what can happen with this much raw umbra in this city, we need to move now."
"Ricky: Yeah, let's go."
Rowan: Let's go.
Cody: Let's do it.
Sofia: Let's do it.
Cody: Let's go.
Brennan: Cool. I'm going to open Google maps to see how long a normal transit from-
"Emily: Yeah, I'm curious if I could get a short rest while we do this."
"Siobhan: Yes, I would also love to have a short rest."
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: Let me go ahead. You guys can absolutely take a short rest. That may mean that certain spell effects end, I would ask you guys to check your, check whatever spells you guys have to see-"
"Murph: Yeah, I don't think I have anything on me."
"Lou: I will, Alejandro might leave. I have Alejandro for an hour and I have true sight for an hour."
"Brennan: Okay, so in that case, I think if you guys want to take the short rest, it's a six heroes or the other. So you can either head there with Alejandro and Kingston having true sight, or you can head there with the short rest, which gives you a lot of bonus, people read, like, I think that's bardic and ki points, and people would be able to roll hit dice and shit like that."
"Ally: I mean, we can split up and I would go with you, Kingston and Alejandro."
"Lou: Well, I think if we need Alejandro I think we prefer to have everyone. So we'll take the long way."
"Kingston: Alejandro, thank you for your service. You will be called on again."
"Brennan: Alejandro looks at you and says,"
"Alejandro: listen, it is an honor to fight alongside you."
"Brennan: And you see he gives JJ and Esther a big hug. Esther's fully crying, seeing Alejandro. It's like this is crazy-- You guys have so much shared history together. It's so emotional here and you guys are going into a new chapter of your life. There's gonna be like kids, little junior champions of New York City running around. Esther weeps into Alejandro's shoulder. Alejandro is like, looks at you and says, and goes,"
"Alejandro: I am going to return to paradise, but for the rest of the time that I am here, let's see if we cannot set things right here at Gramercy."
"Brennan: And Alejandro walks up and begins working his angelic wizard magic on the umbral engine and begins to pinpoint on a perfect map of arcane New York City, every single Gladiator machine in the city. Pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum! He's like,"
"Alejandro: I'll make sure to save it before I return to paradise, (blows a kiss) good luck!"
"Brennan: And you see, he walks over to you Kingston, gives you a kiss on the cheek, and puts his hand on the egg in this like messenger bag at your side and he goes,"
Alejandro: know this child of Kingston Brown and Liz Herrera. My name is Alejandro Ortiz. I am in your debt. You need only say my name three times and I shall appear.
"Brennan: His eye goes gold,he smiles, goes back to work. You guys grab the long scenic bus. So I'm gonna need all you just, go ahead and do your short rest stuff. Roll, whatever hit dice you're gonna roll."
"Emily: Can you roll the maximum of your hit dice if you choose to, it just means that next, if you took on another short rest you wouldn't have any left?"
"Brennan: Yes, correct."
"Emily: Cool, okay, I did that."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: I just wanted to make sure that was right.
"Brennan: Yes, yes, yes, absolutely. Is everybody back up at full hit point wise?"
Emily: I'm at 96.
Ally: No.
"Brennan: All right, let's go ahead and boogie, you guys are, I know you guys are all doing your short rest. I trust you guys to do that. The main things that have refreshed on a short rest are Sofia's ki points, right?"
"Emily: And my hex blade, and my warlock spells."
"Brennan: And your warlocks spells. Hell yeah, so Sofia's-"
Emily: And my hex blade curse. I'm fully back at normal except for hit points.
"Brennan: Pete, I know that our big spell casters, have cast a lot of their spells, including our paladins. But I think also bardic inspiration comes back to Rowan."
Siobhan: My bardic is back. I still have a couple big spells.
"Brennan: Cool. Awesome. Guys, you rush North in New York"
Lou: Immediately.
Siobhan: Battle to battle.
"Brennan: You think we're done, we're not done. We're not done."
"Sofia: My friends, I will protect you. I do well with short rests."
"Ally: Though we have to play so smart now, fuck!"
(all laughing)
Siobhan: There's gonna be another one after this which says-
"Brennan: Yeah, that one felt like the final battle, didn't it? Now, so, all of you head North. Kingston your bus pulls right up and-"
"Emily: Oh, on a short rest. I did have a level of exhaustion. Does a short rest fix that?"
Siobhan: Oh yeah same.
"Brennan: No, exhaustion is long rest, I'm pretty sure."
"Emily: Okay, all right. But that doesn't affect attack rolls it's just ability checks."
"Brennan: That is correct. Let me go ahead actually, and just double-check all of that. Yeah, this is conditions."
"Emily: Oh, also everyone's, I think on a short rest you can use the time piece again for the next fight. I'm pretty sure that using it and taking a level of exhaustion recharges them too, on a short rest."
Siobhan: I give Cody has watch back.
"Cody: Oh, thank you."
Rowan: Thank you.
"Zac: Okay, then I'm up there-"
Rowan: I stole it.
Zac: I used all my-
(overlapping chatter)
Cody: I steal stuff all the time. I stole this Big Gulp.
Rowan: Stealing is cool.
Cody: Stealing is pretty rad.
"Rowan: Stealing, I mean, only from people who deserve it."
Cody: I've recently learned that.
"Brennan: Yeah, so it's only long rest. So Kingston, Sofia, and I believe Rowan, all have one level of exhaustion, which is gonna be disadvantage on ability checks."
Emily: Ability checks.
Siobhan: Okay.
Ally: But do we have a lesser restoration person in the group?
"Emily: But they might wanna, people might wanna save, it's only ability checks, if anyone needs it, may be it would be Kingston, 'cause he might have to do ability checks."
Zac: I didn't have it stocked for today.
Lou: I have it stocked if people end up needing it I got you. But for now-
Emily: Kingston what if you just dash a little bit of your detergent on yourself.
"Brennan: We've actually used, the detergent got used up in the last fight. The greater restorations on the warriors. So we are going to, so yeah, those are there, just gonna double check something."
"Lou: That's why you don't casually use a fourth level lighting bolt, 'cause you just never know. You never know."
Siobhan: You never know.
Lou: God what was I THINKING?
Murph: This is why you don't stack smites every single attack.
Brennan: Oh shit! The Gotham time pieces are once on a short rest.
"Emily: Short rest, yeah, that's what I'm saying, so we will have that again, right?"
"Brennan: You had that ability, but that second level-"
Emily: Speed is halved.
"Brennan: Yeah, that second level of exhaustion gets rough for sure. You guys are a bunch of tired New Yorkers, you've been using New York minute time magic to make yourself accomplish more, you're really feeling the hustle today."
"Rowan: Yeah, could we get a chopped cheese and a regular coffee on the way."
"Pete: Oh, that sounds so good. Jamaican beef Patty."
"Kingston: Hey, 10 out of 10 times, I would but..."
"Brennan: Actually, you know what I'm gonna say,as you guys are running La Gran Gata runs up with a bunch of bags of chopped cheeses and regular coffees from the nearest bodega from Cosmos bodega and went,"
"La Gran Gata: I know that you are going in to bring back the dragon of New York City so please help yourself. Normally an indulgence to stop and get lunch, but you'll need to eat or you will not be able to fight to your greatest ability."
"Pete: La Gran Gata, did you get any jalapeno kettle chips?"
"La Gran Gata: Oh, you want the jalapeno kettle chips, I got the jalapeno kettle chips."
"Pete: Just with the chopped cheese, it's so good."
"La Gran Gata: I also know some people are trying to be healthy, so I got some of that balsamic roasted almonds."
Ricky: I'll take one of those.
"Pete: Oh great, oh great, yeah."
Cody: I'll do the jalapeno chips.
"Rowan: You put the chips in the sandwich, you get a little bit of a crunch."
"Pete: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Cody: Me and Pete had popcorn for lunch and dinner last night, so I'm super hungry."
"Pete: Me too, I'm fucking starving dude, I'm so hungry."
"Brennan: You see that La Gran Gata jumps up and is, looks and goes,"
La Gran Gata: I will be watching over you and my champion Sofia Lee.
"Siobhan: As we're going up there, I would like to cast a six level motivational speech."
Brennan: Holy shit!
"Siobhan: I'm gonna stand up and do the full “once more unto the breach, dear friends”, at the front of the bus. So everybody gains 20 temporary hit points"
Murph: Nice.
Siobhan: And there's also other stuff as well.
Emily: Is this like a bardic hero's piece?
"Siobhan: Yes, for the duration, the affected creature gains and has advantage on wisdom saving throws."
Zac: Seems good.
"Siobhan: If an affected creature is hit by an attack, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes. So if you get hit, you then have advantage."
Emily: Wow.
Brennan: Holy. Shit!
"Siobhan: And then once you lose all those temp hit points, those extra effects go away, but you have some get hit but lightly."
"Lou: Great, and then I'm gonna throw a first level cure wounds into Sofie's sweater."
"Emily: Oh, thank you. I'll also just for the heck of it, cast pass without trace on all of us."
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: In case we wanna sneak in and stuff like that.
Ally: Great.
Siobhan: Yeah. I guess I'll do another see invisibility on myself since it's at-will.
"Brennan: Incredible, incredible, this is all so awesome."
Emily: Jump on myself as well.
"Siobhan: Okay, so. Oh, slowly exposing-"
"Brennan: Yes, you guys approach, you're like housing, these chopped cheeses and coffee as you're walking."
"Pete: Dude, we haven't eaten in so long?"
"Cody: I know, oh my God, this is insane."
Pete: Just now realizing dude.
Cody: Fuck dude!
(overlapping chatter)
"Emily: I think I look at Esther and say,"
Sofia: Aren't we like supposed to avoid cheese or something like that?
(overlapping chatter)
Rowan: It's not real cheese.
Esther: I talked to my mom and she said that she didn't avoid any of that stuff when she was having me. And I don't think that's like-
"Sofia: Cool, all right, I scarf some."
"Brennan: Yeah, you see that… Yeah, all of you on the bus have this intense… You're all like, okay here's the next thing. We're going, we're going, we're going, we're going. But also just on a bus covered in blood, like- HOOO! As Rowan's giving this incredible speech. Rowan you have concentration, any other active concentrations right now?"
Siobhan: It's actually not a concentration.
"Brennan: Whoa, that's quite good. Cool."
Ally: That's so sick.
"Brennan: Dale's gonna throw a lower level, so it's plus two to attack and damage on Sofie."
"Sofia: Oh my God. (Sofie laughing) I mean, everyone should get married."
(all laugh)
Emily: I look at Ricky when I say it.
(all laughing)
"Zac: Ricky just nods like, cool."
"Brennan: Cool, cool, cool, cool."
"Lou: One more, I'll throw a bless on the fighters. So Sofie, Cody and Ricky."
Ally: And Pete.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Kingston: Pete, all right, you eat popcorn. You eat popcorn as a meal, all right, you should be scrapping."
"Brennan: Cool, I'm gonna need everybody here. So you guys have your spells active, you're feeling good. you're going into it again. Go ahead everybody and roll initiative for me."
Murph: Oh boy.
Zac: Oh and I have advantage on initiative now.
Brennan: Yes you do.
Siobhan: 25.
"Emily: God, I rolled well, it's like, I just needed Dale back Um, 23."
Murph: Good Lord.
Ally: 15.
Zac: I got a 12 for my initiative.
Brennan: What is Cody's?
Murph: Also a 12.
Brennan: Kingston.
Lou: Eight.
Brennan: And Rowan?
Siobhan: 25
"Brennan: 25, Kingston as you're headed here. Let me ask, is there anything that you text or say to Liz on your way here?"
"Kingston: Hey, pick up a bottle of champagne. I think we're gonna have to celebrate tonight."
(laughter)
Brennan: I fucking love it. Rowan you got a 25 initiative?
"Siobhan: Yeah, I did."
"Brennan: Okay, everyone go ahead and head to the board, you all there on Roll20?"
Siobhan: Wow!
"Brennan: This is not like the other encounter that we had in darkness, this is currently in explorer mode. You guys get to a, this is a couple blocks away from the 110th Street Central Park North. This is just a Central Park North subway station. And you guys begin to descend down the steps. Kingston, as you walk lower and lower, you begin to recognize this thing of a hidden secret subway stop. You guys get down and see the floor littered with subway tokens. Many of you probably are not even, some of you might not even remember subway tokens, or were not in the city when there were subway tokens being used. But you all walk down and feel the presence, number one, of powerful ancient magic. And Kingston, you feel the egg humming with power and energy."
"Kingston: Uh, we're close y'all, real close."
"Brennan: And you also feel roiling raw umbra all throughout the neighborhood on your approach here. So there are no combatants. You guys, we're gonna go in initiative, because we are existing in physical space, but there is no combat right now, this is actually just exploration. So go ahead. I would recommend moving your pieces sort of like in smaller increments, to discover as much area as possible, but we're gonna go through the initiative. Rowan, you are first to act."
Siobhan: Smaller increments like?
Brennan: Yeah like two ten-
Murph: I think if you click your icon and then you move like the directional pad you can inch and that might be good in case anything pops out or anything.
"Siobhan: I feel like, that's my full movement right there. So I might as well take a-"
Zac: A double?
Siobhan: A double movement.
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it. There's no combat happening right now. This is just… All this, is an exploration encounter. You guys are exploring this map right now."
"Rowan: There's a room to the left. Oh, and there's train tracks. Oh, we're on a subway, oh, of course."
Brennan: Amazing.
Rowan: All right.
Brennan: I will say…
Rowan: Nothing else I see down here
"Brennan: I'll actually say, just to speed us along. Everyone else, go ahead and inch your way into the room with Rowan. Yeah, you guys all begin to step further and further into the space and see huge mounds of subway tokens, glittering treasures, and the steps leading down into, the steps leading down towards that subway. And I'm gonna say, just to keep us moving along time- wise, until you guys want to like split up or investigate something or cast spells, we can just sort of do a group movement. So if you guys want go ahead and-"
Emily: Can we all be stealthing too?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. Go ahead and give me a group stealth check. You all have pass without trace remember."
"Siobhan: Oh, but we have disadvantage on-"
"Brennan: Ability checks, yep."
"Emily: Yeah, all right."
Zac: I just have-
"Murph: Some of us, I think."
Emily: I still rolled well.
Siobhan: 15.
Ally: What does the pass give us?
Zac: I have disadvantage 'cause my good looks.
Siobhan: 21. Oh yes. (Rowan laughing) You're too handsome to stealth.
"Emily: I got a 32, even with disadvantage."
Ally: What does pass give us?
Emily: It gives plus 10.
"Ally: Okay, great."
Zac: I got an 18.
Siobhan: I got 21.
Lou: 14.
Ally: 15.
Brennan: Incredible.
"Sofia: Kingston, do you think you could benefit from an, do you think you could benefit from an unseen servant?"
"Kingston: Oh, not yet, maybe soon."
Sofia: Okay.
Kingston: I'll let you know.
"Sofia: Let me know if you need someone else, like an extra helper."
(overlapping chatter)
Pete: Do you need like a mani-pedi or like...
(laughter)
Brennan: Incredible. Go ahead everyone and inch down now to the subway platform.
Emily: Okay.
Lou: This is honestly fun.
Siobhan: This is fun.
"Brennan: Yeah, we, this is our first time we've gotten to do an exploration, but it's like a video game."
Lou: What will the audience see?
Siobhan: Whoa!
"Zac: Whoa, I see something down there. Or to either side. Ooh, we got a fork and a road."
"Siobhan: Yeah, there's like tunnels on either side, oh!"
Zac: Can I cast divine sense?
"Brennan: Yes, go for it."
"Zac: Okay, I cast it."
Brennan: You guys pause on a subway line that doesn't run with any trains any of you are aware of.
Zac: You can sense anything affected by the hallow spell I don't know if that's...
"Brennan: Oh, this place is hallowed beyond. And you're feeling… You cast divine sense, Ricky, and feel power coursing from this place. You sense a really powerful primeval dragon presence from within here."
Emily: A dragon presence.
"Brennan: But like an ancient one. More like dragon tracks, the presence of where a dragon used to be. And Kingston's egg is glowing. But you do also get a sort of creeping distant divine sense of something menacing or threatening. But you're on the subway platform."
"Emily: Yeah, I mean, so we have two different places that we could go down. The question is, are we gonna split up or are we gonna go in one direction?"
Siobhan: Can I message the egg? The being inside the egg?
"Brennan: Sure, you can message the egg."
"Siobhan: Okay, I'll message and say,"
"Rowan: hello dear, which way do you want to go?"
"Brennan: Rowan, you message something, and you see, there is like a sleeping thing in the egg that looks like a sweet little human baby that is just-"
Rowan: Kingston's baby is gorgeous. Gorgeous.
"Kingston: Oh God, don't, you get me too excited."
"Brennan: The dragon doesn't message anything back to you, it looks like this thing's power is completely ambient and inborn, it's very sorcerous, it's very like, its mere presence is the thing. But in terms of its mind, is this sweet little baby. It don't know what it's up to."
"Ricky: Guys, should we split up?"
Kingston: I think we should split up. Let's cover more ground.
"Sofia: All right, if Kingston, right now, we are all here for Kingston."
Kingston: Okay.
Sofia: We're at the fucking maternity ward with Kingston.
Kingston: You all know I don't like to be the center of attention. Everyone's allowed to do what they would like.
Sofia: Then stop being so good at it.
Kingston: Okay.
"Murph: Ricky, do you have Ox back? You would have had time."
Zac: I don't 'cause I don't have a second level spell slot for find steed.
"Brennan: Cool, you guys continue through here together. If you're gonna split up, go ahead and split up."
"Emily: Okay, well I'm feeling fresh. I can really try to help defend people. So the question is where do you think that you need that?"
Zac: Should we split it up the healing? I feel like-
"Siobhan: Yeah, that's a good idea."
Emily: I've got a cure wounds on my jacket from Kingston.
Siobhan: I have some heals left.
"Zac: But should I be with the egg though, because I have to use the power of Kugrash."
"Emily: Oh yes you should be, you should be."
"Murph: Maybe Kingston, Ricky, Sofie-"
Zac: Baby squad?
Kingston: Baby squad.
"Murph: Baby squad, and then me and Rowan and-"
"Siobhan: Baby squad and then daddy squad over this way for Rowan, Pete, and Cody."
(Sofia laughing)
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: It's pretty like- Literally all eggs in one basket though. Losing mommy squad would be awful.
Emily: If you all-
Siobhan: That would be pretty bad.
"Emily: If you all wanted, I could also try to just, because I have such crazy movement, I try to jump ahead, stealth ahead to see what's down one of them to see if we get a lead. Like I could burn some ki points to do that."
Murph: I think there's no reason to waste them yet. Why don't we just split up and yeah. It's good to also I feel like you and I being split up is good because I've got the moped and you're super fast.
"Emily: Okay, cool."
Zac: So we can double back.
"Murph: Yeah, exactly, we can double back if need be."
Zac: I'll go right..
"Lou: Okay, but is that baby squad?"
Emily: Baby squad.
Murph: Baby squad.
Siobhan: Daddy squad is going left.
Murph: Daddy squad is going left.
(laughter)
Lou: There's something about us moving like this that is very funny.
(laughter)
Just like slowly...
"Brennan: Okay, you guys split up."
Emily: I think Dale is coming with me personally.
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, why is Dale going...?"
Emily: I snagged him.
(Sofia laughing)
Siobhan: We'll take JJ then.
"Lou: Yeah, y'all can have JJ."
"Siobhan: JJ is definitely a daddy squad. And we're definitely not the kids, We're definitely the daddy squad."
(Sofia laughing)
"Brennan: You guys go ahead and start inching, so I'll say the group with Rowan and it has first initiative, so Rowan's group start inching towards the tunnel that you're headed to."
Ally: Cool.
Brennan: And after they go let's have the other group go and head to your tunnel opening as well.
(all gasping in awe)
Siobhan: What is that?
"Brennan: Hell yes. You guys move in. What you see before you, Rowan, Cody, Pete, JJ, all of you see an ancient automat. You see sandwiches, cakes, pies, beverages. There are giant rune-covered revolutionary cannon in each corner, and if you'll direct your attention down here you'll see a giant golden boombox. If you recall this automat from the very first scene of this season, others see a giant rotunda with a growing tree where the leaves are made of street signs of all the old names of streets in New York City. And, cool. You guys can continue to move past this. You guys see an exit of the automat across next to the beverages area, and the rest of you in the rotunda, you guys see two other exits."
Siobhan: I wanna do some stuff in here.
"Brennan: Cool, what do you wanna do?"
"Siobhan: I wanna do an investigation or a perception, I guess perception check on this boombox to see if I can turn it on to see if that will, or if turning it on will help us out."
"Brennan: Oh actually Rowan this is a boombox, this is a piece of artistic gears. I'm gonna say this is a performance check."
"Siobhan: Hell yeah. So I'll roll that flat, 'cause I have advantage on performance and I have a plus 13."
(Brennan laughing)
"So yeah, I got a 24."
"Brennan: Ooh, baby, this boombox is a boombox that plays the greatest songs and beats and tracks ever written or recorded in New York City. You sense, absolutely if you were to hit play on this, anyone in the room would get continual bardic inspiration dice while they were in the room."
"Siobhan: Oh, you know, I smash that play."
"Brennan: Incredible, you hit play… (Brennan beatboxes) This incredible thumping bass comes on with a little hint. It's some incredible like late eighties, early nineties, hip hop track, with some kind of like Gershwin piano over it. And like Duke Ellington trumpet solo in the back (beatboxing) Every single person in that room gets a D6 bardic inspiration."
Ally: Cool.
"Lou: Dude, you are gonna walk over there?"
"Zac: Yeah, can I pop over there?"
"Emily: Yeah, actually I already have a bardic."
Murph: I already have a bardic as well.
Emily: But you guys can definitely go walk over there.
Zac: Is this a door way?
Siobhan: And then I want a slice of that dang pie.
"Ally: Well, I was gonna say, can I walk up to the pie thing and open up the thing and try to talk to the Dutch woman?"
"Brennan: Yeah, sure Pete, you can do that."
"Ally: I'd be like, “hello”."
"Brennan: Yeah cool you, but, you see this dutch woman turns still hanging up laundry, like 30 years later, she looks at you and says in Dutch she's like,"
Dutch Woman: the head has appeared to the meadow once again. There's a boy's head in the meadow!
"Pete: Yeah, hello."
Dutch Woman: What are you doing here?
"Pete: Yeah, I am a with my friends."
Dutch Woman: How did you break your head?
"Brennan: You poke your head out a little bit and see that you are coming out of an extradimensional window in just a field near a farm. So there's no like, she can't see your body or legs 'cause she's just seeing the space of the automat window. And she goes,"
"Dutch Woman: what is wrong, you have no legs or body."
"Pete: No I'm fine, I'm-- yeah, New York City?"
Dutch Woman: What is New York City?
"Pete: Yeah, New York City, anyway-"
"Dutch Woman: No, you're in New Amsterdam!"
Pete: Tot ziens!
(while laughing)
Ally: I just...I run.
"Brennan: You run. She yells you're in New Amsterdam, you flee-"
Zac: Do you still have the feather beard?
"Brennan: Still have the feather beard. Cool. Siobhan, you said that Rowan bought a slice of pie from the automat?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm gonna buy a goddamn slice of pie. Rowan's been in Faerie for years."
Brennan: Please roll a D6 for me.
Siobhan: A three.
Brennan: You get three temporary hit points.
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: Hey, cool."
"Rowan: Get in here, get in this pie. It's so good."
Emily: I'm actually good.
Ally: I definitely have a bite of that pie
"Emily: You already gave us 20 temporary hit points. So, I can stick with that."
Brennan: Your temporary hit points-
Zac: Oh you can't stack.
Brennan: You can't stack.
Siobhan: I didn't get any temporary hit points so I will take those three.
"Cody: I'm actually super full from having non-popcorn food, that was nuts."
"Brennan: Cool, can you guys…"
Pete: Dude that was crazy.
"Brennan: So you guys find these two rooms, but you guys, there's another tunnel coming out of the rotunda with the street tree and you guys can go down into those-"
Emily: Can I?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: Yeah, I wanna just inspect this street tree to see, it's so strange, and I just am curious if there's anything about it."
"Brennan: Oh, give me either a perception or investigation."
Emily: And I will do it with disadvantage because of exhaustion.
Lou: I'll give Sofia to help action to flatten that out.
Brennan: You're both so exhausted.
"Emily: Oh, hey!"
Zac: I got a 21.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: I got a dirty 20.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you guys both start looking at the tree and you see that the street signs sort of flicker in like a wind blowing as though the tree were"
blowing in the wind at the presence of the egg being here.
Emily: Do they point in a direction or anything?
"Brennan: Yes, they point deeper in through the tunnel in between the rotunda and the automat, deeper, deeper in. Also, let's go ahead, each of you, you guys"
"each rolled a 20, right? Ricky and Sofia?"
Zac: Yeah I got a 21.
Emily: I rolled dirty-
"Brennan: Ricky and Sofia, the tree reaches down two branches to you and you see two little pieces of fruit appear to just Ricky and Sofia."
Zac: I'm gonna put it in my pocket.
"Emily: Are you sure we go for it Ricky? I'm gonna, can I do like an insight check?"
"Brennan: Yeah, give me the insight check."
"Emily: You know what, I'm gonna fucking use my bardic on this."
Brennan: Okay.
"Emily: Oh, okay, my insight is an 18."
"Brennan: Everything you've seen here in the dragon's cavern has felt pretty great to you and you see, these are two juicy, big apples."
"Emily: I almost wanna take a bite, 'cause if it like restores spell slots, I wanna give it to someone else."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: So I'm gonna take a little nibble and see if I like, if it feels like selfish for me to eat it."
"Brennan: This doesn't feel like it's related to spell slots at all, but it feels good, it's tasty."
"Emily: All right, I eat it."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: Well you know, maybe I don't. it might be a healing thing. I'm gonna pocket it as well. Thank you very much."
Zac: Same.
Brennan: You guys both pocket those apples from the street tree.
(laughter)
Lou: Street tree apples.
Siobhan: Street apples. I hope you wipe them down first.
"Brennan: You guys continue, let me know what tunnels you're going down to go deeper in."
Zac: I'll go to the right.
Lou: Yeah.
Murph: Yeah. We can keep poking.
Siobhan: Maybe let's split up the same way again.
Emily: Egg baby squad.
Zac: Can I make a perception check on the way we came from? Just 'cause I'm worried what is coming after us.
"Brennan: Yeah, give me a perception check, Ricky."
Zac: That's a 21 plus-
"Brennan: Ricky, on a 21, you don't perceive anything in particular, but you don't get a great feeling about looking back in that direction."
Ally: Oh no.
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: You guys continue down on-
"Emily: In that case, I might hold up the rear. I've been going first 'cause I wanna be able to protect you guys but I think I'm gonna go behind you."
"Siobhan: No, no, no, you're pregnant, you can't get taken by Null."
"Emily: Ah, my baby's invincible, thank you."
(Brennan laughing)
"Sofia: Oh yeah Dale, I didn't tell you I went to Lugash and our baby's fucking invincible."
"Brennan: Ah, cool, what's gonna happen now is this everyone, if there's anyone that wants to stay behind you are welcome to do so. For the others, we're gonna go ahead and move you to another part of the map, a new page. Is anyone staying behind?"
Murph: Staying behind I think is a death sentence.
Emily: Or is it a way to hang-\- to keep Null off?
Murph: But the dragon is a way to keep Null off.
Zac: I think there might be a comp… I feel like we should keep going and then maybe we can come back.
"Siobhan: Okay, we can come back if we need to."
"Lou: Yeah, you got that crazy movement."
"Emily: Yeah, that's true, I can always run back."
Ally: This makes me feel very uneasy.
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys are starting to get an uneasy feeling. This place is cool."
Zac: I think I know what this is. I think I know what this is.
Ally: Can I do a perception check Brennan? As Pete with my like danger sense?
"Brennan: What's that, sorry."
Ally: Can I do a perception check as Pete?
"Brennan: Yeah, do give me a perception check."
Emily: Do you have danger sense or...
"Ally: No, is that a real thing?"
Zac: That's a Barbarian thing.
"Ally: Oh, I didn't even know that was a thing. It's a 15 \- plus dangerous sense, so that's a 15."
Zac: Ice feast.
Siobhan: Ice feast.
Murph: Ice feast.
"Brennan: Okay, you guys begin to inch in, this is like a giant burlesque, you see there's like Hippodrome, Houdini, all these shows and places in New York from all kind of time that had different decorations and, different decorations...you know, the showbiz culture of New York in this place."
Siobhan: I push up for the front.
(Brennan laughing)
Emily: What'd you say?
"Siobhan: I said, I pushed to the front."
Rowan: The smell of the-
Ally: Misty's still in there.
"Siobhan: Ooh, look at that."
Brennan: Awesome.
"Murph: Oh, here we are, wow."
"Zac: This is whoa,"
Murph: this is rad.
"Brennan: In front of the board, I'm gonna roll a D20 here. You guys don't want a one through five."
"Siobhan: Okay, hmm."
Rolls a 12
"Brennan: 12, cool."
Lou: That's a 12. That's none of those things.
"Brennan: Cool, everyone go ahead and inch into the burlesque."
Siobhan: Can I pick up 10 of these subway tokens?
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure."
Siobhan: I just want a handful of them.
Brennan: Awesome.
"Lou: Hey, be careful with those-"
Zac: Those might be part of the hoard.
"Siobhan: Exactly, and you can get dragon madness. I'm not gonna take them out, I just want to make sure that I-"
"Brennan: Awesome. All of you move deeper, so there's a passageway coming out going to the right and there's one to the left as well."
"Emily: Ah, the one going to the left, if you're standing on the stage, looking out at the audience, the one going to the left is where we just came from."
"Siobhan: No, we came from the top, didn't we?"
"Emily: You guys came from the top, but we came, the baby squad came from the left."
"Zac: We came from the right or not, my screen."
Murph: Yeah you came from the right.
"Emily: Oh, I'm saying left if you were standing on the stage looking out-"
"Siobhan: Oh, stage left."
"Lou: This is, where I'm standing is the only like-"
Murph: Stage left?
"Emily: So sorry, Rowan's rubbing off on me. I rented that bootleg of Kinky Boots and I'm just really feeling theatrical."
"Siobhan: Rowan hasn't been on stage for three years and is like excited to be there again and can't help like maybe just doing one little, like"
Rowan: ♪ Everything's coming up Rowan ♪
♪ For me and for you ♪
Emily: I sit and politely watch.
Lou: I applaud.
"Siobhan: Thank you, thank you."
"Brennan: Go ahead and inch your pieces down the hallway. Or wait there might be a door there, which is if you can't see past it."
Siobhan: Yeah there's a door there.
"Brennan: But you guys can just go ahead and start inching left, go for it."
(soft music)
You walk into this next room.
(all gasping in awe)
Siobhan: Who's in this cage?
"Brennan: All of you see a, if you guys zoom in on that cage, you guys see there is a giant tiger wearing a top hat with a Shamrock in it who has just a small collar around his neck, but it's the only piece of clothing other than the hat that he's wearing, smoking a cigar, in this giant bank vault, and you see huge bank vault door next to it. As you guys enter, the tiger looks up and says,"
"Tiger: Oh well, hello, hello, hello friends, there hasn't been someone in here in some time."
"Zac: Wait, a second. Go on sorry, keep going."
"Tiger: Just, say there, friends, Now, I don't suppose any of you are members of the voting public, are you?"
"Pete: Ah, yes."
"Sofia: I am, yeah."
"Tiger: Wonderful, wonderful, well, listen. I seem to have gotten myself into a bit of a pickle. Gotten locked up in this cage. I don't suppose any of you would be open to the prospect of helping me out of here, would you?"
Rowan: What does that have to do with voting?
"Tiger: No, what did you say?"
"Sofia: You said the voting public, who are you?"
"Tammany Tiger: Well, my friends call me Tammany, you can call me Tam."
Sofia: I thought you might be.
"Tammany Tiger: No, no-"
"Sofia: This is Tammany Hall. This is like, represents, what was the fucking guy in Tammany Hall?"
Brennan: Boss Tweed.
Sofia: Boss Tweed. This is fucking Boss Tweed.
Ricky: What is that?
Rowan: What is that?
"Sofia: Boss Tweed is a corrupt politician from Tammany Hall. I think it was sort of a name for, Boss Tweed was just a corrupt politician."
"Tammany Tiger: He says, corrupt politician, corrupt politician, I'm not a corrupt politician. I represent my constituents as well-"
Sofia: You know I'm pretty sure they have a bar named after you now in New York.
"Tammany Tiger: They should have more than one, shouldn't they?"
Sofia: It's actually a pretty bad one too.
"Tammany Tiger: Well, that's not my fault."
"Brennan: Tiger takes the cigar in his mouth and his like,"
"Tammany Tiger: in any case, you might notice that I'm a very wealthy tiger, if you'd only notice-"
Lou: I'm gonna hit Boss Tweed with a sacred flame and keep moving.
(all laughing)
Zac: Can I make an insight check to see if he's evil or just weird.
Brennan: Do you still have divine sense up?
Emily: Boss Tweed was a bad politician.
"Zac: Sorry, what?"
Brennan: Do you still have divine sense up from earlier?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: He has a fiendish aura. This is like something that the old dragon of Bleecker Street captured here. Sofia is absolutely right. The tiger was the symbol of Tammany Hall, the most corrupt political instrument that has ever existed in New York City history. He says,"
"Tammany Tiger: all right, well if any of you would like to make a, would make a dollar and do well for yourself, come by, I'd be happy to strike up a deal."
"Rowan: Hey man, you can't smoke in here, there's laws in New York City you can't smoke inside a public bank."
"Brennan: Esther looks and says,"
Esther: there's also several pregnant people in here so.
(Sofia laughing)
Ricky: You're gonna have to put that out.
(Sofia laughing)
Siobhan: I prestidigitation the cigar out.
Brennan: Tammany looks at you.
Sofia: Hey who put you... Who put you in this cage?
Brennan: Tammany looks at you-
Sofia: I kind of wanna know who put you in this cage.
"Tammany Tiger: Well, you know, it's interesting. The old dragon of Bleecker Street wanted to preserve me, he didn't think that I should die. So he kept bringing me back and I kept running back out into the city and you know, doing business as usual. And he said he really-"
Sofia: 'Cause money in politics keeps happening (laughing).
"Tammany Tiger: No, no, no, but listen, just because I've gotten out a bunch of times before doesn't mean you shouldn't be the one to let me out this time."
"Pete: All right, I say, I'm like, all right, I can let you out but give us the code to this safe."
"Tammany Tiger: Oh yes, there's a terrible code on the safe. There's no cracking it, no way, no how."
Zac: I'm gonna try to open the safe.
(all laugh)
"Brennan: It immediately opens. Ricky, it opens right away and he goes,"
Tammany Tiger: wait!
Kingston: Let's keep moving.
"Brennan: Incredible. You guys leave Tammany and he's like, I can make you all very wealthy!"
Cody: This dude has Bazathrax energy.
(all laugh)
Kingston: Bigtime Bazathrax energy.
Rowan: What does Bazathrax think of him?
"Brennan: Bazathrax goes,"
"Bazathrax: what the fuck is going on out there dude, that guy sounds awesome, let him out."
(all laughing)
Cody: Shut up Bazathrax.
"Bazathrax: He sounds like a cool dude. Hey, I gotta talk to you, you're my boss now, can I get vacation time, what's the deal?"
"Cody: Your whole fucking life is vacation time, Bazathrax, just go back to smoking a bowl."
"Sofia: Cody, give him maternity leave if he needs it though."
"Cody: All right, fuck. You get a maternity leave for all my friend's babies."
"Brennan: Okay, he says, oh,"
"Bazathrax: you know what, I'm pregnant too actually, I need maternity leave."
Cody: Okay.
Brennan: I'm gonna roll another D20 in front of the board. You guys don't want a one through 10.
Rolls an 11
Lou: That's none of those things.
(all sigh with relief)
Brennan: Everybody go ahead and inch your figures down past through the vault door.
Siobhan: Ooh!
Lou: Wow!
"Siobhan: Wow, look at this."
Lou: This is where I met him.
"Emily: I keep thinking this is it, but this one really seems like it."
Siobhan: It seems like it to me.
Emily: Everything is so beautiful. I keep thinking it must be.
"Siobhan: Ah, look at this."
"Emily: Ooh, look at that… Is than an apple made out of rubies or some kind of gem?"
"Siobhan: Oh, like the CBGBs."
"Brennan: It's CBGBs, the CBGB sign."
Siobhan: Ally! All that research didn't go to waste!
"Brennan: Sofia, do you see that glistening ruby apple? If you had to describe the size of that apple, what would you describe it as?"
Emily: (After a long pause) Big.
(buh-dum-tsssch)
(everyone laughing)
Ally: So defeated.
"Cody: Wow, it's a huge apple. Look at the huge apple, everyone."
Brennan: Amazing.
Cody: Fucking huge ass apple. I get it.
Siobhan: I do actually wanna Scrooge McDuck in all this money?
(all laugh)
"Brennan: Rowan, I'm gonna let you absolutely Scrooge McDuck in all these subway tokens. You effortlessly swim through them and you guys see a CBGB sign. The subway series between the Yankees and the Dodgers. You see the Ebbets Field sign. You see this giant glittering, ruby, apple. Kingston, this is where you met the dragon of Bleecker Street all those years ago. The egg is gleaming within your hand as you look at the Dragon's nest, it's hoard, here's it's hoard."
"Lou: I look over at Ricky and I'm just like,"
"Kingston: this is the spot, this is it."
"Brennan: I'm gonna roll a D 20, you guys don't want a one through 15."
Rolls an 11
"Lou: Oh, come on."
Brennan: That's another 11. Everybody here make a perception check for me.
Emily: That is going to be a 28 for Sofia.
Lou: A 30 for Kingston.
"Emily: Oh, I'm sorry not a 28. I added it incorrectly, that's a 26."
Zac: 25 for Ricky.
Brennan: Okay. Who here beat a 20?
"Lou, Zac and Emily raise their hands"
Emily: I did.
Lou: Mom squad.
Brennan: Mom squad beat a 20.
Lou: Mom squad crushed a 20.
"Brennan: So that's Ricky, Sofia and Kingston, right? Did Kingston beat a 30."
Lou: I got a 30.
"Brennan: Sofia and Ricky, you both perk up. Something bad is going on. You sense… I think you both hear like off in the distance, so quiet."
"Gladiator drones: (Whispers)Hi, I'm Sparty, I'm here to give you everything you need."
Brennan: And Kingston-
Emily: I have been so desperate to fight these fuckers.
"Zac: I hear that, and can I tell what the AC is of-"
(everyone laughs)
"Sofia: Dale, you're an angel. Do you know the AC on these fuckers?"
"Brennan: He says,"
"Dale: beats me and no, I don't think anyone ever knows."
Brennan: Incredible. I'm going to-
Ricky: We gotta slow them down.
"Brennan: And Kingston on that 30, On that 30, you hear,"
♪ Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Bumm ♪
"On that 30, I think you hear a, you feel the presence of Null manifesting in the physical world again."
"Kingston: Ooh, Null's back y'all."
"Brennan: You guys hear that and that is going to be Rowan, you are first to act."
"Siobhan: Oh, wow, yes, I forgot. Do I have any idea how close these guys are?"
Brennan: I think your allies are pointing them out. I think they're closer than you think.
Siobhan: I'm going to cast animate objects.
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Siobhan: So I think what I'm gonna do is, since we're here, would you say Brennan, that this subway car counts as huge?"
"Brennan: That that subway car counts is huge? Yes, I would say that."
"Siobhan: Great, so I'll animate the subway car, plus two of the tokens. I guess the subway car counts as eight out of 10, and then I get two...small...guys."
"Brennan: Incredible, I'm gonna say that the small guys are actually whirlwinds of tokens. The two spinning dust devils of subway tokens appear on either side of Rowan, flanking you, you guys see (*KWUHM!*), that subway car turns on and begins to lurch out of the coins."
"Siobhan: Great, and then I'd like to turn to Ricky and say"
"Rowan:Ricky, when's the new calendar coming? We've all been waiting for it."
Siobhan: And I give him bardic inspiration.
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: Incredible. Any movement? Any movement from Rowan on that turn?
"Siobhan: I think I wanna move up to here where it's like, it seems-"
Brennan: A little bit... cool.
Siobhan: Like a solid ground with a little bit of coverage.
"Brennan: Faerie light begins to pour out of the big apple. And suffuse you with power and energy as you take up your station to, as the the queen of Faerie should, oversee the birth of a new dragon of New York. Incredible turn Rowan. Do your animated objects go on your initiative or do they roll on their own?"
"Siobhan: I'm just checking, sorry. It's such a long spell card."
"Brennan: I know, why don't you check in with that and get a full debrief of it while we move to the next in the initiative order. Sofia, that's gonna be you."
"Emily: Okay, I'm going to first use my forty-five movement or I'm gonna start to move, I need to get a lay of what's happening on the other side of this door. So I get the other side of this door, let me see how much movement that was, but let me know if I see anything"
"Brennan: You charge out, see Tammany laughing and goes, haha, here they come."
Emily: Do I see anything in this room?
Brennan: You do not see anything in this room.
"Emily: Okay, then I'm gonna step of the wind and can I carry Dale with me?"
"Brennan: No, I'm gonna say no."
"Emily: Okay, I just feel like I absolutely would be able to carry my husband, but okay. And then I'm looking down through this hall."
"Brennan: Awesome, you see everything that Sofia would see in that hall. Also, let me just double check with Carlos too. Carlos, let's go ahead and keep hidden things hidden, but also let's turn off dynamic lighting now that the whole space has been explored. Sofia, you look into the next room. You see drones moving in the burlesque and you also see (*BWZZZMM!*), a crackling spirit with hands and head made of static. So there's some fully, Null has been able to fully possess people. Sofia, that's what you see on your movement."
"Emily: So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to now, since that was just, I used my bonus action for a movement, I'm now going to cast darkness right on this hallway."
"Brennan: Hell yes, awesome. That's 15 foot radius."
"Emily: Yeah, 15 foot radius. Or maybe I'll do it right here. You know what, yeah, I'm gonna do it right fucking here because I can see in the dark. So they'll all be running in, they won't see me. Maybe I can get opportunity attacks on them. So it'll be right at the mouth of this hall."
"Brennan: You fill the hall with darkness, (*BWWOOOM!*). Sofia that's your turn."
Emily: And then I'm crouching there waiting to try to get an opportunity attack.
Brennan: Incredible. That is fucking great. Okay. Anything Siobhan that we should know about the animated objects?
"Siobhan: It doesn't say on here, I've been trying to find a thing that says whose initiative it goes on. It does tell me their dex so I could roll initiative for them."
Brennan: I think let's say they go on your turn. I think that's the easiest.
"Siobhan: Can I then have them, can I have the train move to this entrance hall, so it's mostly blocking it?"
"Brennan: Oh, to the entrance hall, yes, you can have the train post up, like waiting by the vault door basically and blocking it, absolutely. (buzzing lips) train moves in the way. Sofia, awesome. Sofia, you set up your little trap and I'm gonna tell you how many fish you catch, hold on. (Sofia laughing) Incredible. Holy shit. What, great terrain management. Sofia (buzzing lips), static-ing in through the walls, right in the entranceway one, and then two, of these corporate spirits (buzzing lips). Flash in. They're within the darkness and you see clearly from how they're moving they have dark vision"
Emily: But that doesn't work in darkness.
Brennan: And you see how truly confused they look at the deeper darkness waiting for them (buzzing lips) as they-
Emily: Did any of them appear within five feet of me?
"Brennan: Ah yes, one of them did."
"Emily: Oh wait, oh, they would have to move out of it to get an opportunity."
"Brennan: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Pete, that's gonna be you."
"Ally: Okay. I am going to full dash to right there, and then prepare a bonus action with my, you know, you know what I'm saying? Oh, with my quicken spell."
Brennan: Hell yeah. What spell are you preparing?
Ally: I think I'm preparing dispel evil and good.
"Brennan: Dope as hell, very, very cool. You prepare it, you're just gonna cast it on the first thing you see?"
"Ally: Yeah, I'm going to try to get whoever's come… I saw Sofia disappear it seems like stuff is coming in towards us so..."
"Brennan: Cool, yup, yup, yup, gotcha. Okay. That is Pete's turn, you have that readied. Kingston, you feel something move from the staircase to the subway platform."
"Lou: Yeah, all right."
"Kingston: Well, Ricky, let's get to work on this ritual"
"Lou: and I'm like, yeah. I don't think it's my turn, but..."
"Brennan: Cool. Okay, it is not your turn but you feel something moving. That is going to be Esther. Esther is going to look up at you Ricky, hit you with haste (soft buzz) and-"
Ricky: Thanks.
"Brennan: And is going to,"
"Esther: she says you got it, sweetie. I'm gonna go help the frontline."
Ricky: But be careful.
"Esther: She's like, I got it."
Ricky: Your super powerful and awesome but… I'm so excited to baby-proof the house.
(all laughing)
"Brennan: Incredible, that's gonna be you Ricky."
"Zac: I guess it's time to invoke the Juicy Cockroach, the Spicy Pigeon, and the regular Unicorn."
"Brennan: Hell yes, dude. You invoke those three spirits. Go ahead and give me a… you know what, yeah, you're good, man. You (*BWWWZZZZOOOHHH*) jump in, Ricky you invoke, what does Ricky say as he invokes those spirits?"
(Ricky chuckles)
"Ricky: Dear Juicy Cockroach, and…"
Zac: It was like praying like a child.
"Brennan: Yes, I love it."
"Ricky: Dear Juicy Cockroach and Perry the Spicy Pigeon, sorry, Marty, the Juicy Cockroach and our Unicorn friend. In the name of Kugrash, I think we should all join our bonds and hands together to welcome a new baby into this world, maybe a couple, I don't know. We got a baby dragon over here that is just itching to be born. And I think we should celebrate that, come celebrate. Come on and celebrate"
(all laughing)
Brennan: Ricky-
Emily: You essentially sent out an e-vite.
"Brennan: Yeah. Ricky, you throw your arms wide, say this such incredibly wholesome thing, and appearing around you in an explosion of light, Perry the Pigeon, Marty the Cockroach, and the Unicorn of the Cloisters."
(*BBBBZZZZZZOOOOOOHHHHHWWWW*)
"Incredible. Any bonus actions or movement, you summoned them, you know they have to do something complicated now."
Zac: But I can leave maybe?
"Brennan: You can leave, you've done your part. You summoned the champions of Kugrash and are now good to go."
"Zac: I wanna run up to the darkness. I feel a little like I wanna see what the real horde is coming for us. So I'm gonna take a, can I use my, is that an action or can I use a full dash?"
"Brennan: We'll call that a bonus action, so you can go movement and dash and sprint past Esther. Oh, you have haste too."
"Zac: Yeah, so that would be, I have- gosh, what's my movement. Sorry, 30, so 60, 90. I can go 90. 'Cause I don't have Ox, unfortunately."
"Emily: Can I like be there, like since I see people coming, can I help my friends through the darkness?"
"Murph: Ricky, I don't know what your… if your sp… I can do 120 on the moped if both of us can ride the moped. I don't know if that helps you in any way."
Zac: I would hop on if that's cool.
"Brennan: Cool, I think Ricky, you hop on the moped with Cody. Wow, you guys have come a long way."
(Kingston laughing)
Ricky: Did you clean this?
"Cody: It looks nice, right?"
"Ricky: Yeah, wow."
Cody: It hasn't gotten hit once. A bunch of dudes were kicking me in the head and I protected my moped.
Zac: Your whole face is like purple.
"Murph: Yes, it's completely purple."
Cody: Yeah I'm fucked up though.
Ricky: You should invest in a helmet.
(laughter)
"Murph: I'm gonna move Cody to where I can get us. I can get us to here, a little lower than Sophie, on just moped movement."
"Brennan: Sorry Cody, it's not your turn yet though."
"Murph: Oh, okay, I'm sorry. I thought we had the same initiative."
"Brennan: No, oh, you had the same initiative as Ricky?"
"Zac: Yeah, we both rolled a 12."
"Brennan: Oh, sorry, then you do go here, man. Sorry about that. Yes, Cody, you do go."
(upbeat music)
Murph: So it is my turn.
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely, that's my mistake."
"Murph: So I think, go up on the moped, and then I guess I'll just sword out and wait for, to see what comes out of the darkness and attack the first dude I see."
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
Emily: I'm gonna try to stun on a bunch of them so there's like a wall of stunned robots making it hard for them to come in.
Murph: Oh my God!
"Lou: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
Emily: That's my goal.
Brennan: Hell yes. The drones all begin to move towards the darkness.
(*light zapping noise*)
Hold on.
"Zac: Could I have asked the Pigeon, the Cockroach, and the Unicorn, like do they have a guess, or like as any sense of how long this will take?"
"Brennan: It seems like it will take them a little while. You guys will have to hold the line for a minute. Okay, (buzzing lips). More show up. Or actually you guys can't see anything past the darkness, you don't know. Actually in that case, let me go ahead and… Cool."
"Emily: Well, I see everything 'cause I have devil's-"
"Brennan: Oh, that's true, yes, yes, yes Sofia, you do you see. You see where they all are. You see drones (buzzing lips) running down the hallway towards you. That is going to be Dale who is going to join his darling wife and summon his wife-guy aura, let's do it."
(all laughing)
Lou: Wife-guy aura.
"Sofia: Honestly, I feel like, I feel like we should all be wife guys."
Ricky: We should have all married Dale.
Emily: I think that life-
"Sofia: Or Esther, we could have all married Dale or Esther. We could have all done that. We could have all married Dale or Esther."
Ricky: I mean he has the aura I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Emily: I look around in the hoard for a ring.
Brennan: Incredible.
Emily: And then just flick it at Ricky.
Ricky: Who threw this at me?
"Brennan: Kingston, that is you."
"Lou: Great, I look, I pull the egg out and I look at the three totems and"
"Kingston: so you guys, you'll just take it from here?"
"Brennan: You see they look, I think Kingston you… Who has the seven artifacts, who has the artifacts to be returned to the hoard."
"Siobhan: I feel like Kingston would have them, right?"
"Murph: Yeah, makes sense."
Lou: They're all in this messenger bag that fits a dragon's egg. I'm sure I also have a man's leg and a baseball.
"Ally: I was like, I'm gonna hold on to the piece of paper I got."
(all laugh)
Emily: I for sure have the bouquet.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see the totems go, um. Perry goes,"
"Perry: oh, okay, reporting for duty."
"Brennan: Marty goes,"
"Marty: yeah we're fuckin' ready, dude, we're gonna put that magic back in that dragon where we got it from in the first place."
"Brennan: And you see that the Unicorn says,"
"Unicorn: Kingston you take care of business, we got your egg, okay."
(all laughing)
"Lou: Great, great. Well, I plant the egg down on the hoard then like pullout of the, like dump all of the equipment there. Kneel down, give it a kiss and I'll fucking head out."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Go for it, dude."
"Lou: Great, wow take my... Yeah, I think I'm… I'll take a full 60, let's see there, that's, let's go."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Lou: Great, that'll get me. It's like gonna get me right up here."
"Brennan: Cool, hell yeah."
Lou: Cool. Standing next to this weird talking or animated train car.
(growling)
"Brennan: Incredible. JJ, I think JJ, is looking at these three champions. I think he's gonna post up on top of the nest just to guard it in case any shenanigans happen. He's also extremely low on spells."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm not doing great either on spells."
"Brennan: JJ posts up there. We go back to the top, that's Rowan."
Siobhan: Do I get the impression that the totems are gonna be rolling for stuff? To get this dragon hatched?
Brennan: You do feel that they're gonna be rolling for stuff to get this dragon hatched.
"Siobhan: Great, in which case I say to the Unicorn,"
"Rowan: Darling, it's so good to see you out of the Cloisters, I never see you anymore."
"Unicorn: Oh my God, Rowan Berry, listen-"
Rowan: Did you roll in glitter? You look amazing.
"Unicorn: I did, oh my God. That pantsuit is all favors, sweetheart."
Rowan: Stop.
Unicorn: You look amazing.
"Rowan: Thank you, stop, thank you."
Brennan: Amazing.
Siobhan: And then I'm gonna do my full movement with my two little coin...guys.
"Brennan: Hell yes, amazing. Sofia, that is you."
"Emily: So here's what I would like to do. It looks like it's about four across, right? Are there, 'cause I don't see anyone who's there but I would be able to see, right?"
"Brennan: Oh, that's right you would. Let me go ahead and reveal that just to you homie, hold on."
"Emily: Okay, so here's essentially what I wanna do. I wanna stun the first four to bottleneck it, so that they're standing in the way, and then drop the darkness so that everyone can throw their area of effect kind of stuff."
"Brennan: Ooh, shit, okay."
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: So Sofia, can you see the hallway now Sofia? Do you see the tokens that are nearest to you?"
Emily: I see the two that are in front of me but I'm assuming that there's like...
"Brennan: There are no more that you can see. So -\- sorry. Down the hallway, I will reveal some more to you down the hallway, hold on. Down the hallway, you're seeing these ones as well. These drones coming."
"Emily: Okay, but they haven't moved into the space."
"Brennan: No, not yet."
Emily: Okay then I probably will-
"Brennan: I also say the two spirits in front of you, you can tell are like wraiths they're incorporeal."
"Emily: So they can't be stunned, is that what that means?"
Brennan: You have a feeling that these will probably not be able to be stunned.
"Emily: Okay, I guess I shout to everyone,"
"Sofia: these are all coming in next turn, so I'm probably gonna leave the darkness up just so that they have disadvantage on me and I have advantage on them. Is that cool with everyone? They're coming into this room."
Pete: Yeah.
Ricky: Yep.
"Emily: Okay, cool. Then I leave the darkness up, and I'm just going to make my attacks on the first wraith."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: That is going to be a natural 19 plus two plus three plus nine. Okay. I'm assuming that hits...that's 24 plus nine. So that's 33.
"Brennan: Yes, definitely hits. Yes, definitely hits."
Zac: Does 24 plus nine hit?
(all laughing)
"Emily: I rolled a 19 and then I have bless and I rolled a four on bless. Okay, so that's just gonna be a, that's just gonna be a, sorry, I have to go to that page. These are wraiths so that's just gonna be too close, so just seven damage. Oh yeah, sorry, 10 damage on the first attack of the wraith. That is gonna be a 29, does a 29 hit..."
Brennan: 29 certainly hits.
Emily: That's gonna be another 15.
"Brennan: 15, hell yeah."
Emily: And then I'm gonna flurry of blows.
Brennan: Go for it.
"Emily: Unless I think, do I think that the guys behind them could be stunned?"
Brennan: Give me a perception check.
"Emily: Okay. Ah, that's a two."
"Brennan: You have no idea. You know how you would try to, but you feel you might, I think even on a two, you feel better about them than you do the wraiths."
"Emily: All right, then I'm gonna let this wraith take an opportunity attack on me and I'm gonna go to fight this one here."
Siobhan: It won't get an opportunity attack on you in darkness. If it can't see you it can't make an opportunity attack.
Emily: You're right.
"Brennan: Okay, you jump up to that other drone there. Go for it, roll your attack."
"Emily: That's gonna be 15 plus. Oh, I'm now outside of Dale's thing, but spiritual weapon still works, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, correct."
"Emily: Okay, so that's 15 and I still have advantage 'cause I'm attacking from the dark. 15 plus 9, 24 the two I rolled on bless plus the two he gives me, so 29."
Brennan: 29 damage?
"Emily: No, 29 to hit."
"Brennan: Yes, 29 definitely hits."
"Emily: And then that's gonna be 12 damage, and I'm gonna use a ki point to try to stun it."
"Brennan: Baby, that's stunned."
Emily: Great.
Brennan: You clock it (buzzing lips) and see it shorts out.
"Emily: And then I will flurry of blows to try to attack this one, this time not with advantage."
"Brennan: You run up vertically on the wall and hit, go ahead and make an attack on this last one."
"Emily: That is gonna hit 'cause it's an 18 plus two, plus I didn't even roll my bless, but why not? I mean 18 plus two plus nine. So I mean-"
"Brennan: Yeah, 18 plus two- Yeah, you've hit for sure."
"Emily: Okay, so I hit him for, I hit him for 10 damage and then I'm gonna try to stun him as well."
"Brennan: Holy shit. You hit the first one for 18, right?"
"Emily: No, no, the first one I hit, I don't remember. I've been getting, because I'm blessed, and I've actually just rolled really well these times, I'm in like high twenties every time."
"Brennan: Oh Jesus, for damage?"
"Emily: No, no, no, no, just for attack."
"Zac: The first attack was 10 damage, I think."
"Emily: Yeah, it's a low damage 'cause these are my offhand attacks too."
"Brennan: This one does succeed, is not stunned. But how much damage did you do?"
Emily: 10.
"Brennan: Okay, hell yeah. You (buzzing lips)"
Emily: And then I have a little bit of movement left so I might go back into the darkness and he can get an opportunity attack on me if he wants.
Brennan: Hell yeah. He is gonna take an attack. That is a hit from the drone.
"Emily: Uh, shield."
"Brennan: Would a 17, 23, no, it would go to 24, it just misses, incredible."
"Emily: Cool, so now I'm back in darkness so they have disadvantage on attacks on me."
(buzzing lips)
"Brennan: Sofia is a fucking nightmare just (*attacking noises*). Incredible. That's going to be these corporate spirits. Hold on a moment here. Okay, they are going straight for the egg."
Zac: Ooh fuck.
Murph: I had an action prepared to wale on the first bad guys we see.
Zac: Oh yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: Can we, can we attack? 'Cause -so did Ricky."
Brennan: You both do?
Ally: I have one too.
"Brennan: Yeah, you all did."
Zac: I'm gonna use my bonus action.
Murph: Yeah he has a bonus action and ride on the moped.
Siobhan: My animated objects have also not gone yet.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. These guys are incorporeal which means they can move through walls. So you only have the time on them as they are shooting down, I'll show you where. As these two spirits fly along the wall, this is the time you have. Go ahead, we'll go in initiative order. So Pete, or actually, based on who prepared their actions first right? Pete, you had an action first. First one comes flying out, you have dispel good and evil, ready."
"Ally: Yes, so I'm going to cast that… So I have a question because this says that it gives people disadvantage on their attack rolls against me."
Brennan: Yes absolutely.
"Ally: And then so like, dismiss that effect, I can use like break enchantment or dismissal or something."
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely, yes, yes, yes. So you would lose the disadvantage but you would send one of them, you know, you could banish one of these things basically."
"Ally: I'm gonna do that, yeah. I'm gonna dismissal on one of these."
Brennan: Hell-
Ally: Suits.
Brennan: These fucking suits.
Ally: These freaking cogs.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. First one comes rushing out. Pete, is gonna make a charisma save. As it does so, this entity, these entities do have a plus two. This thing needs a 15 or higher. We're gonna roll a D20 in front of the board. First one, heading right for the egg. That's a 10, baby. Pete, tea flies out of your teapot, as the spirits (buzzing lips)."
"Spirt: Hi, don't you wanna let us sit inside?"
"Pete: No, I like to shop local."
"Brennan: Bam! It's gone, baby. That spirit is no more. Next one comes thundering out of there. Cody and Ricky, you guys have your prepared actions."
Murph: Sweet.
Zac: Hell yeah.
Murph: I'm gonna hex it as a bonus action with my new sword. Then I'll make some attacks.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: I'm gonna Great Weapon Master.
"Brennan: I'm gonna say you guys rush up there to double team this wraith. Dale's also gonna start you off with an attack of opportunity, hits."
Zac: I got a 26 on my first attack.
Brennan: That hits.
Murph: I got a 10.
"Zac: A cocked 19 that I will re-roll, that becomes-"
"Murph: I got a 10 on my first attack Brennan. Oh wait, it's actually...bless, 12."
Brennan: 12 to hit the wraith?
Zac: Does a 19 hit?
Brennan: 19 does hit.
"Zac: Okay, and then I have haste so I'm gonna take a third attack."
"Brennan: Cool. Cody, you took two attacks, right?"
Murph: I took one so far and missed.
"Brennan: Got you, six, eight-"
Murph: Will I do a great weapon on the second one?
Zac: Does a 17 hit?
Brennan: Dale hits it for 27. He roundhouse kicks up to 27 points of damage as it leaves his threatened area.
Murph: I got a 22 to hit it with great weapon fighting. Great weapon master.
"Brennan: Yes, that hits."
Murph: Great.
"Brennan: You guys roll your damage. And Ricky, how many more times do you hit?"
"Zac: I hit two times at least, but the last one was a 17. Does that hit?"
Brennan: 17 does hit.
"Zac: Okay, cool."
"Brennan: You guys go ahead, I'm gonna let you two do all your crazy paladin shit and and roll up your damage."
Zac: Two D8 each time so-
Murph: 30.
Zac: Six D8 plus 21.
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Lou: Okay, here we go now."
Brennan: How much damage did you guys do to this thing?
Murph: I did 30.
Zac: I do six D8 plus 21 'cause it's improved… 45
(cheers)
"Brennan: Incredible, Dale roundhouses this thing. Cody and Ricky, you bound to the top of this mountain of coins and simultaneously pass each other in the air with the baseball bat and the infernal blade and twin-scissor eviscerate this wraith. It is destroyed (buzzing lips)."
Ricky: Hell yeah.
Murph: Absolutely.
"Ricky: I'll go all out, just this once."
(all laughing)
Cody: You must.
Brennan: Incredible.
Zac: Do we get a sense of if they could come from the walls in that egg room?
"Brennan: You don't know how close that egg room, you know that they probably can't travel through walls indefinitely, if they're like other incorporeal things. Because they need to know where they're going. So they're using physical space to tell where to go, but as soon as that one entered the room, it saw the vault inside and was gonna make a break for it through the walls, right? Sofia, you see another one of these things (buzzing lips) sizzle into life right in front of you in the hallway."
Emily: And that's the wraith thing?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Emily: Okay, I shout back to everyone,"
Sofia: There's another one!
"Brennan: And that is going to be pa, pa, pa, cool. After that, Sofia-"
Siobhan: Oh shit there's more.
"Brennan: You see, after that, that's gonna be Pete, that's your turn."
"Ally: I'm gonna move right there with my little 30 feet of movement and prepare a Banishment with, how many more sorcery points do I have? It's fucking worth it. A Banishment with Heightened Spell."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you gotta, okay. You prepare a banishment with heighten spell, awesome. Moving forward, Kingston, you feel something flash forward from the subway platform all the way to the burlesque, (buzzing lips). Sofia, concealed in darkness, you see Null appear in the center of the burlesque."
(*ghostly noise*)
And that is going to be the end of our episode.
(all groan in disappointment)
"Brennan: Tune in next week for the final chapter of the Unsleeping City season two. Null, the dragon, the champions of New York city and a final battle to succumb to the emptiness inside or to renew the magic of New York once and for all. Tune in and see you then. [laughs maniacally]"
Zac: ...Bill Seacaster?
(all laugh)
"Lou: Bill, dad!"
Brennan: Oh my God!

(jam out to The Unsleeping City theme one last time...)
(...for now?)
"Brennan: Hello, one and all! And welcome back to the thrilling finale of season two of ""The Unsleeping City."" I am your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Siobhan: (Whispering) Hello, intrepid heroes."
"Brennan: Last we left off, our heroes had been having quite a day, having defeated Tony Simos and the treacherous program from Gladiator Industries, seeking to harness raw umbra to collapse time and destroy magic forever. Our heroes found out that indeed the hoard of the former Dragon of Bleecker Street, soon to be the the new dragon of New York City stowed here in Central Park North, AKA young junior of Kingston Brown and Liz Herrera is on the way to be born here if our heroes can defend the child from the onslaught of delivery drones, strange possessed corporate entities, and Null itself who has shown up in the cascade of raw umbra to end the memory of New York City before it can even be born by destroying its memory, destroy its future and destroy any hope that could be in this place. We return to combat as Null appears in the center of the burlesque staring down the hall at Sofia surrounded in the wading darkness. And we are going to jump right back into combat to defend the child and save the Unsleeping City. Next to act after Null is going to be… Esther Sinclair. Esther is going to run out into the vault, and she's going to ready an action, baby. Or actually, she's gonna, you know what? She's gonna have to do a full dash. So, she's going to full dash."
"(to the tune of ""Radioactive"")"
"Zac: ♪ Ready an action, ready an-♪"
(everyone laughs)
"Emily: Oh my gosh. That was, like, Cody-level."
Siobhan: You spent too much time around Cody.
(everyone laughs)
Zac: On the back of his moped.
Cody: ♪ Wake me up inside! ♪
Siobhan: You have to imagine the dragons.
"Brennan: Cody. Cody and Ricky, that's gonna be you guys."
"Emily: Oh, actually before Ricky's turn, I have a question. Could Dale's wife guy aura, since I'm not using it, could it be like a new dad aura in which case Ricky could benefit from it?"
"Brennan: You know, we really established it as a wife guy aura."
Emily: But wouldn't a wife guy look out for another person who is committed to their partner?
"Brennan: Wow, great point."
(everyone laughs)
Murph: This is airtight. This is absolutely airtight.
"Emily: If Ricky proposes right now, can he get wife guy aura?"
Brennan: You guys-
Emily: I'm just kidding.
Brennan: I'm gonna say that the wife guy aura does extend to other wife guys.
(Emily laughs)
"You think the Tammany tiger at the top of the hall may have the political authority to marry people. So, if you want to get that done real quick right here in the hall, yeah, absolutely."
(everyone laughs)
"Emily: I tried for you, Ricky. I tried."
Zac: Thank you.
"Brennan: Incredible. Cody and Ricky, that's your turn."
Siobhan: I also have the power to marry people I think.
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: So again, if we want to extend this aura as much as we can, we've gotta get sort of cracking right now."
(Emily laughs)
"Murph: Do we want to ride? We don't want to, like, we don't want to like, just like ride into the darkness on the moped, do we?"
Zac: It sounds so tempting. Through the darkness?
"Emily: I mean, I'm here like a traffic cop. I can kind of like, if you're like, as if you were backing into-"
Murph: Make sure we don't crash?
Emily: I can try and shout you through it.
Murph: We could just hold until people come through again.
"Zac: Yeah, I think-"
Murph: Although the spirits might-
Zac: Come back.
"Murph: Yeah, they might do what they were doing before."
Emily: It's only 30 feet. I'm sure you could drive through the darkness if you wanted.
Zac: Let's just drive through the darkness. Give it a test run on some bots. And then maybe come back if it's-
"Murph: Yeah, oh, that's true. We can take an opportunity to attack and come back if it seems really bad. Yeah, let's ride into the darkness on a moped. Is that a good idea? I think..."
"Zac: Ricky's, like, kinda shaking with how much he knows that, like, it's a bad idea. Like, just in terms of safety, but, like, it is a good idea."
"Murph: Okay, great. Sweet. So, we will, let me see. Movement wise we can get very easily, I guess pop out, like, here and hit that first dude?"
"Zac: Yeah. I mean, that's the one that's stunned if that matters."
"Murph: Oh, that rules. Yeah, let's do that. Okay, so we're gonna pop out. Boom. Right here. Brennan, I'm assuming we can move through the darkness. It's just we can't attack anything in there 'cause it's dark."
"Brennan: Yes, you can move through the darkness. You just can't be in there attacking people because you can't see."
Murph: Sweet. Ride through the darkness singing Evanescence. And then let's attack. I'm gonna use bonus action to move my hex to this drone.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: And then...
(Murph sighs)
"Brennan: And Ricky, are you following in there on the moped or no?"
"Zac: I was thinking I was. Yeah, sorry, I didn't move my token."
"Emily: Cody, just pointing it out since you're a mounted combatant and you get an advantage on attacks anyways, you could go past this stunned one without taking any opportunity attacks."
Murph: That's true. What size are these robots?
Brennan: Medium size. They're like little-
"Murph: Oh, okay, so I would get advantage. These guys might take a lot of damage. Why don't we let, Ricky, why don't you go first and we'll see what these guys can take."
(Emily laughs)
Zac: All right.
"Murph: Oh no, I'm not trying to-"
"Zac: No, no."
"Murph: Just if we have advantage, I don't want to waste-"
"Ally: Man, how about you go first? Like, you know."
(everyone laughs)
"We can see if they're poison, like, if you go first."
(everyone laughs)
"Zac: Okay, 26 on my first hit."
Ally: Woo!
"Zac: To hit. And then that would just be a two d8, wait two d8 plus six because of the haste, right?"
"Brennan: No, I don't think haste adds extra damage. It gives you an extra attack."
"Zac: I mean, per the bat though, don't I?"
"Brennan: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. So, it's two d8 plus one d6 from haste plus seven."
Emily: Doesn't Ricky also have bless on him?
Zac: Yes.
Siobhan: And also motivational speech.
Brennan: What does motivational speech give you again?
Siobhan: Temp HP and wisdom saving throws and shit.
"Emily: I think the question is, since he has three spells on Ricky, does that mean he gets to add three d6?"
"Brennan: Oh, shit. How many arcane spells do you have on you right now?"
Zac: I think it's just haste. 'Cause I don't know-
"Brennan: No, it's also motivational speech. That's arcane."
"Murph: Yeah, Rowan's spell."
Brennan: But who's bless from? Kingston?
Siobhan: Cody.
"Brennan: Kingston, so it's just two d6. 'Cause it's from Rowan and Esther. It's just arcane spells."
"Siobhan: Oh, okay."
"Zac: Okay, so two d8 plus two d6 on this first guy. Plus seven."
Brennan: Yep.
"Zac: So that would be nine, 16, 23 damage on that first hit"
"Brennan: Ooh, 23 damage on the first. This is one that Sofia has already kind of fucked up a little bit, right?"
"Zac: Sofia, would it help if I knocked him down one or do you want him-"
Brennan: You don't gotta knock them down at all. This bat comes out of the darkness and crushes that delivery drone.
"Murph: Oh, sweet."
"Zac: Oh, I didn't even roll with advantage."
"Siobhan: Yeah, you should've rolled with advantage. Roll just to see if you,"
"Emily: eh, it doesn't matter."
Murph: Let's keep plowing through dudes I guess?
Zac: You want to go for that void dude or the-
"Murph: Yeah, let's go. Let's go for the fuckin' void dude."
Zac: We're just smashing mailboxes.
(Brennan laughs)
"Lou: Wow, you really have come around."
"Murph: It's a very high school day for me, getting my ass kicked by random dudes and then smashing mailboxes."
Zac: I rolled a 23 to hit.
Brennan: 23 hits.
Zac: And then I'll just roll my second attack on it as well.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
Zac: With advantage. And then a 20.
"Brennan: 20 also hits. So you hit that spirit twice. Zac, you calculate damage. Cody, what are you doing?"
Murph: I will go for the same dude unless Ricky's able to finish him off which I don't think he'll be able to do right away. Can we say I move my hex to
him since he's like my target?
"Brennan: Sure, go for it."
"Murph: Spirit's my target. Sweet, so I'll do hex on them. I think I will, should I great weapon fighting? I will. Cool."
Lou: Yeah.
Zac: I think I did 42 damage. I did 42 damage to that first guy.
Brennan: Oh my God.
Zac: To the void-ish-
"Brennan: To the void dude? Not down, but you thunder down on that one. Deal 42 points of damage."
"Murph: I got 22 to hit, and I had great weapon fighting. Great weapon master."
"Brennan: 22 hits, you connect."
Murph: Sweet.
Emily: You guys should fuck up these void guys 'cause I can't stun them.
"Murph: Okay. Oh my God, I just rolled two d6s. I'm rolling my d6s 'cause I'm realizing I'm not getting to reroll 'cause I have great weapon fighting as well. So two d6s and then a d8 and then another d6, right?"
Brennan: Yup.
"Murph: Okay, rolled a one on my d8. So, that's 37 with great weapon fighting."
Brennan: Holy shit. You deal 37 damage? What types are those damages by the way? Is that all slashing?
"Murph: No, the 12 plus the and then one is radiant and four are, what does hex do, fire?"
"Brennan: Cool. Even with that, you guys sail out of the dark on a moped, and Cody and Ricky slam into this corporate wraith. Cody, you're having the best time of your fuckin' life."
Cody: It fuckin' rules!
"Murph: Sweet, I have one more attack. I'll go for the next dude."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Amazing.
Murph: The delivery-
Brennan: The delivery drone.
Murph: That's a lot. That's a 29 to hit.
Brennan: 29 hits.
(Murph sighs)
"Murph: Okay. This one does not have hex. Shit, should I smite? I don't have a lot of spell slots left. I will save them and just do a little hit."
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Just a little one.
Zac: Should we run back?
"Murph: Yeah, and then we can ride back I think."
Emily: Riding in and out of darkness like going through tunnels.
Zac: Walking backwards on the moped.
Siobhan: Turning a moped backwards. It's so hard to turn them around.
Murph: 21 damage.
Brennan: You deal 21 damage?
Lou: On a little hit?
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, you fuck that thing right up, dude. Blam."
"Murph: Okay, should I just hit it with my moped?"
(Murph laughs)
Zac: Can you do that and double move with it?
"Murph: I think not double move, but we haven't used that much movement. Let me see how much we've used."
"Brennan: You've used, like, 65 feet of movement."
"Murph: Okay, nevermind. Okay, we will back up."
Cody: Should we just hide in the darkness?
Ricky: Sounds awesome.
Siobhan: Poking out of the darkness a little bit every now and again.
Murph: We hide in the darkness.
"Brennan: Cody, you get slapped for 10 points of damage by that delivery drone with an attack of opportunity as you guys bounce."
"Murph: Oh, I will hellish rebuke it."
(Brennan laughs)
"Oh wait, no I won't. No, I won't. I have so few spells. Stupid, stupid. I was excited."
"Emily: I don't know, it might end it."
"Murph: I know, but if it doesn't it's not worth it."
Emily: Okay.
Murph: I can do a lot with smites.
Zac: I think spell slots might be better on other things.
Murph: Spell slots are very important.
Zac: Like the other creatures. I don't know.
"Murph: Ricky, do you want to move yourself into the darkness here?"
Zac: Yes.
Lou: Move yourself into the darkness.
Brennan: This one is still stunned.
"Zac: My mind is like, but I'm on the moped. It should have just picked me up, but that's-"
Brennan: Okay. These guys are gonna start charging into the darkness. This is so interesting. I wonder… Okay. This is so wild.
Emily: It means that they'll all get disadvantage on all attacks.
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. So we're gonna go, boom. Boom. Boom."
"Emily: Wait, if that guy just ran by me, I would get an opportunity attack, wouldn't I?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yes, you do."
Emily: Okay.
Ally: With advantage.
"Emily: Oh yeah, you're right."
Zac: And do you have bless?
"Emily: Yeah. Nine plus two plus, 22..."
Brennan: 22 points of damage. You badly fuck up one of-
"Emily: No, 22 to hit."
"Brennan: Oh, 22 to hit. That hits. Yeah, absolutely."
"Emily: Okay. That's gonna be, hold on."
"Brennan: I'm just gonna let you guys know, so that you guys can calculate so that we speed up combat, these delivery drones have an armor class of 19. So, if you hit 19, you hit them."
Zac: Yes!
Brennan: You finally got the delivery drone class.
"Lou: Thank you, Brennan. Thank you. All these episodes wasting our time."
Emily: So I hit him for 11.
Brennan: Hit him for 11.
"Emily: I hit him for 11, and I'm gonna stunning strike him."
"Brennan: Oh, shit. Okay. This is huge. These guys don't have a huge plus, and he's gonna gum up the hallway if he gets stunned. So, he needs to get a 14 or higher. I'm gonna roll in front of the board. Oh!"
Rolls a nat 20
Emily: What?
"Brennan: Brutal. Not stunned, but takes the damage. So only three of these guys are gonna get attacks on Cody. That's three hits"
Emily: With disadvantage.
Murph: With disadvantage?
"Brennan: Oh, disadvantage."
(Brennan gasps)
Lou: The darkness.
"Brennan: Okay, only two of them hit. Cody, you take 12 plus- you take 20 points of damage. As these drones-"
Zac: I'll take one of those hits.
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Thank you.
"Brennan: Cool. Ricky, you take nine, and Cody, you take 11. Now the rest of these dudes are going to continue to kind of just like thunder through here towards the edge of the darkness. They're going through their buddies' space. One, two."
Zac: Maybe I should've taken an opportunity attack.
"Murph: Yeah, we're just in the dark not knowing."
"Cody: Ricky, do you see them?"
(Emily laughs)
Ricky: They're around us. And they're definitely not going anywhere else.
"Brennan: Cool, hold on. We got more of these dudes comin'."
Lou: We got drones over here.
"Cody: I kept saying that I was like a Lord of the Darkness, but I was in hell and it's actually pretty bright. There's like fire everywhere, so."
(Emily laughs)
Ricky: I guess that would be another case of two sides of the same coin.
(Murph laughs)
Cody: Two sides of the same coin.
"Zac: When Ricky doesn't know how to relate to Cody, he just says that."
(Murph laughs)
Ricky: Two sides of the same coin.
"Murph: And Cody, just finishes it."
Cody: Two sides of the same coin.
Emily: And feels really seen.
Murph: I like the idea of the moped still playing music in the dark.
"Cody: Shut up, shut up!"
(Emily laughs)
Zac: Oh my God.
"Brennan: At the end of Ricky and Cody's turn, Null is going to use a legendary action to-"
Lou: Whoa!
"Siobhan: Oh, shit."
"Brennan: Yes, it's getting bad out here, gang. Thankfully Null is not that powerful doing spell casting with legendaries. Null reaches out, and it dispels the darkness at the end of the hallway. Darkness fades out and that uses up all three of its legendary actions."
(Emily laughs)
"Emily: Honestly, I was probably gonna do it in a couple of turns."
Cody: I can see. I can see in the dark.
(Emily and Ally laugh)
"Brennan: Having done that, our good dude-"
Cody: When the coin is together we can see through the darkness.
Brennan: Dale is going to leap forward here. He's gonna take the swings.
Zac: Is this void dude alive still?
"Brennan: Yeah, the one there that you can see?"
"Ally: Oh, when that darkness is dispelled can I use my prepared action to attack that void dude with a banishment?"
"Brennan: Yes, you absolutely can. Hold on one second. That's gonna be 15 plus eight is 23. Dale takes 23 points of damage from those drones as he moves by them though. Runs up and he's like,"
"Dale: Got your back, sweetie!"
Brennan: And he's gonna take some attacks on the drone in front of him.
Sofia: Did you see me cast darkness?
"Brennan: He's like,"
"Dale: It was great, sweetie!"
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: Pulverizes the drone that was already injured up here and is gonna use his movement to get further into the hallway. That is going to, and Pete, go ahead and let's resolve that banishment. You spring it on this spirit right here I'm assuming?"
"Ally: Yeah, the void guy, the boss looking guy. And is there a way, I mean, he's gonna have to roll his like charisma saving throw. Is there a way for me to reach out and have, like, Null feel this?"
"Brennan: Sure, absolutely."
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: And you heightened this, so this dude's going to roll with disadvantage. He needs the lower of these two rolls to be a 15 or higher."
Rolls a 19 and a 13
19 and 13. But you are now holding concentration on that as a reminder.
"Ally: Thanks. Yeah, totally."
"Brennan: Pete's got concentration on that. Moving on down the line. That was Dale. Kingston, that is your turn."
"Lou: Great. We'll just move to join the fight in there. And then… Yeah, let me huck a sacred flame at the lower drone."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
Lou: Dex save 17.
Brennan: Dex save 17. Let's see what this dude rolls.
Rolls a 4
"That's a natural four, baby. He does not make it."
Lou: I'm gonna do a three d8. We love to see it. That's gonna be 20 points of damage.
(Brennan mimics explosions)
"Brennan: You light up that drone, badly injured. After Kingston, JJ is going to give the help action to, the unicorn already has some bardic, but he's gonna go over and give the help action to Perry the Pigeon up here, sort of guiding the birth of this new dragon up here. So, here's the deal, we're gonna roll for these spirits first. The DC to birth the dragon here 'cause really they're trying to summon Kugrash, right? So, to summon Kugrash with all of this raw umbra present, they get a plus eight to the role, but they need a DC, it's a DC 25. A 17 or higher does it on these rolls"
Siobhan: They all three have to get 25?
Brennan: All three of them have to get 25. We're gonna roll for the unicorn first that has that bardic inspiration die. Unicorn first.
Rolls a 10
"10, That's an 18. Could hit on a seven or higher if the unicorn uses that bardic die right now. I think the unicorn knows time is of the essence. He's gonna go for it. Here's a d10. You need a seven or higher on this roll."
Rolls a 4
Four. Doesn't do it.
"Sofia: It was the right move, Unicorn. That was the right move."
"Unicorn: Thanks, hun, I'm tryin'!"
"Ally: From far away, can I bend luck?"
(Brennan gasps)
"Brennan: I will let you, if you want to use your reaction, I'll let you do a bend luck here to add one d4 to this roll. You need to hit a three on the d4."
Ally: Okay.
Murph: It's 50/50.
Rolls a 2
Brennan: Two!
(everyone groans)
Brutal.
"Emily: Again, these were all great moves. Everyone, great moves, okay? It was all the right things to do."
"Brennan: Perry's getting a help action, so he's gonna roll two d20. He needs the higher of these two to be a 17 or higher."
Rolls a 4 and a 13
13 and four. Marty the Cockroach is gonna go try and summon Kugrash.
Rolls an 8
"Eight. Doesn't get it done. Moving forward. That goes back to the top of the order. Rowan, that is your turn."
"Siobhan: I think I might be most helpful just in here, 'cause I am pretty low on spells. I only have first and second level spells left. But I can give another bardic, and I can also give a help action."
"Ally: Yeah, definitely."
"Siobhan: So, I'm gonna move my coins and have them and the train ready in action. So, they're like standing guard either side of the door, so they will get opportunity attacks on anybody who tries to run through."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: And then the train will be immediately able to get them. And then how close do you need to be to give the help action?
"Brennan: I believe you need to be right next to somebody to give the help action. Yeah, 'cause that's the mastermind thing is being able to do it ranged. You need to be next to someone to give the help action."
"Siobhan: I can only get to here, but maybe they can move one square up."
(Emily laughs)
Brennan: You can give the help action from five feet away. That's totally fine.
"Siobhan: Great, great. And then, I will say to Perry,"
"Rowan:I don't know if this is rude, but you look so clean. You look a lot cleaner."
(everyone laughs)
"Perry: I'm living in a coop right now, so you know, it's not that. I remember my grimy 20s. And it was a lot of fun honestly. 'Cause you're in your 20s. You're exploring yourself-"
Rowan: I remember the grimy 20s like they were yesterday. Don't tell me-
"Perry: No, no, not the decade. I'm not immortal. I'm talking about my 20s."
"Rowan: Oh, your 20s. That's still pretty old for a pigeon."
(Emily laughs)
Zac: Are the 1820s the grimy 20s?
(everyone laughs)
"Rowan: Yeah, the 1820s, pretty filthy. 1720s honestly were pretty disgusting as well. Most of the time before the 1920s, honestly."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Emily: So, 2020 is gonna be bad?"
(everyone laughs)
Siobhan: No.
"Brennan: Perry has the d10, and you're giving the help action to the unicorn. Sofia, that's gonna be your turn."
Emily: Okay. Let's do this. The one that's right in front of me. I'm gonna try to hit it. I do. I hit it.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: I hit it for 12.
"Brennan: Oh, hell yeah. Boom!"
Emily: And then I'm gonna try to stun it.
Brennan: Let's go.
"Emily: And I have a question, since this is like a mechanical thing, is there any way I could short circuit it rather than just stun it?"
Brennan rolls a 14
Brennan: Makes it not stunned
"Emily: Like, almost like stun it longer?"
(Emily laughs)
You just have to ask.
Murph: This is airtight.
Siobhan: Seems airtight to me. I was honestly thinking the same thing.
Brennan: It is not stunned on that first attack.
"Emily: Okay, cool. So, we are not going to-"
"Zac: So, it's shut off or?"
(Emily laughs)
"Siobhan: Yeah, I feel like they just switched the off switch. Right? There's a big on/off switch on the back."
"Emily: That's another hit and I'm actually gonna hit it for, I'm actually gonna hit it for 15."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: Is this thing down?
"Brennan: No, it is not down yet. But you're rolling with advantage, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool, good, good, good."
"Emily: Yeah, no, I'm rolling with advantage."
"Brennan: No, it is not down yet."
Emily: Okay.
(Emily sighs)
I think I'm gonna try to stun it again 'cause that'll gum up things and that's my goal.
Brennan: Hell yeah. You go for another stun.
Rolls an 11
This time it fails. It is stunned.
Emily: Yes. Okay. Now I am going to the one that's directly across from me.
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: Actually, you know what? Fuck it. No, I'm gonna go for this one. I'm gonna move into this spot, so that I can go after this one, so that I can try and make it so that, I want to try and stun this one also."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: And that is gonna hit. And this time it's only a d6. So, that is 11. And then I'm gonna use my final ki point to try to stun it."
Brennan: Let's go.
Rolls a 19
Survives. Makes it.
Emily: Fuck me. And then can I inspect the apple in my pocket to see if it's just a health apple or if it's like replenishes other stuff?
"Brennan: It doesn't look like it ""replenishes other stuff."""
(Emily laughs)
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: But how much damage did you do on that last one by the way?
Emily: 11.
"Brennan: 11, cool. No, the apple looks like it might have an unrelated magical effect."
"Emily: Okay, cool. And then I'm gonna fuckin' stand in the way. So, at least between me and this stunned one, it should be more difficult for-"
"Brennan: Yeah, much more of a bottleneck for sure. Okay. After Sofia, bam. Fly speed of 60. The question is, yeah, that's gonna do it."
Zac: Is that Nod or I mean Null?
"Brennan: That's not Null. That is a corporate spirit. I am going to need two intelligence saving throws from Sofia, Ricky and Cody, and I'll roll some for Dale right now as well."
"Murph: Remember that all of us we're all in the aura. So, everybody gets plus four."
Emily: And then do we get anything for intelligence saves with the like bardic hero's feast or not?
"Siobhan: No, it's just wisdom."
"Emily: Yeah, that makes sense."
Murph: We're also blessed.
Siobhan: Bards cannot help you with intelligence.
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: Natural 20 on my first one.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: My first one's a fail. I'm guessing it's a 12.
Murph: I got a 16.
"Emily: Oh, I just got a nat 20 also!"
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Zac: I have bardic inspiration still, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, I believe you do."
"Murph: I got a 16 on the first one, a 14 on the second one."
Zac: A nat 20 and then a 16.
"Brennan: Remember also when you get hit by these things as long as they do less than 20 damage to you, you have advantage on your next hit."
Emily: I think this is the Null guy doing his-
Brennan: These are the minor spirits. These are not as powerful as Null's-
Murph: Oh.
Emily: God damn it. I was hoping I was gonna become immune to that.
"Brennan: So Dale, how much do you guys give with your, you have plus four?"
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool. Did any-
Emily: Oh! Wait plus four then I actually would've got a 16. What was the DC?
Brennan: Did any of you guys roll either of your two saves lower than 14?
"Emily: No because of the Paladins, I didn't."
Murph: I got exactly 14.
Zac: I shouldn't have used my bardic but yeah.
"Brennan: Incredible. You guys take zero damage. However, Dale is not so lucky."
(Emily gasps)
Dale takes...
"Murph: Dale, you absolutely have to live, dude."
Emily: Wait a second. Can I use my nat 20 to like take his damage?
"Brennan: I will let you take his damage, but he's still gonna get stunned."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: So you take 17, 19, plus four. You take 23 points of damage. Dale is hit. He hasn't had a meat brain in a couple years and gets rocked bad by this psychic blast. Dale is stunned. He'll be able to make those saves at the end of his turns, but he is stunned right now."
Emily: Send your moped to go pick up Dale and bring him away. I don't want anyone getting attack advantage on him.
Brennan: That is going to be Pete. That is your turn.
"Ally: Hey great. I am going to move right up here. And then I am going to cast erupting earth in the second doorway and try to hit all of these like drones right here. So, on the side of the door closest to Null."
Brennan: Hell yes. Okay.
"Emily: Ooh, it'll make a difficult terrain too, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, you'll slow them way the fuck down."
"Ally: 120 feet and it's a 20 foot cube, so that should hit all of those little guys and maybe some in the second group."
"Brennan: Yep, you can hit, you can absolutely. You know what? Homie, you can hit the first two in the second group and everybody in the first group, no problem."
"Ally: You love to see it. Okay, great. This is a three d12 bludgeoning"
damage on a failed dex save.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: And now each five foot portion takes a minute to clear.
"Brennan: Although I will also tell you, you won't be able to hit the first two if you want to also hit the doorway into the hall. So, if you want to get the doorway into the hall, it would be like that and the first six. That would slow them down the most."
"Ally: So you think if I'm trying to get the first two, I'm still leaving a little crevice for them to kind of be able to slip through the door?"
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Ally: I'll scoot that back, and I'll just hit the first six."
"Brennan: Cool. Rad as hell. Ally, go ahead and roll that bludgeoning damage."
Ally: Do I roll that or is it just a save?
Brennan: Five of them fail their saves. You roll damage.
"Ally: Oh, incredible. Oh, great. Three d12, I'm gonna roll that. Here we go."
"Rolls 4, 3 and 11"
"Brennan: Ooh, baby."
"Ally: 18, honey."
"Brennan: Jesus. These drones get fu- Pete, you shutter the ground. That doorway fully collapses. There is now, like beams and rafters fall. These robots are gonna have to crawl through wreckage to get into that hallway. Incredible job by Pete. And these drones are badly, badly hurt. You think the incorporeal ones will not have as hard a time, but the main army of drones is gonna have a hard time getting in."
"Ally: Can I do a perception check and see, it kind of seems like Null is, like, afraid or, like, weak and is just hanging in that other room. Can I try to see what's up there?"
"Brennan: Null is not gonna be hanging for long, Pete. And its Null's turn right now, so I'll let you decipher how Null is feeling from the next series"
of things that happen.
Emily: I think that Null used his legend. He was hanging back to get rid of the darkness.
"Zac: It feels like classic, ""I'm a bad guy who's leading an army."""
"Ally: Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I think you guys are all right."
"Siobhan: Yeah, that's truly so many of these dudes still."
Emily: I'm gonna get so fucked by Null.
Brennan: Okay. Null is going to cast dimension door and appears right in front of Sofia.
Ally: Okay.
"Sofia: Hi, old friend. Probably weird to see me moving around considering last time."
(Brennan laughs)
"Brennan: Yeah. You just see the bright burlesque go gray behind you as a silhouette moves directly in front of you. That's going to be Esther's turn. Esther's going to cast chain lightning. That's gonna be ten d8 lightning damage to And she's gonna do that. And there is a save for half, I believe. It's a dex save. I'm gonna roll for these four. None of them make it. Esther just holds the staff of sorrow aloft and reaches out and lightning crackles forth from her hands. One, two, three, four. Drones are destroyed."
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: After Esther's turn, that is gonna be Cody."
"Murph: All right, so I think we absolutely have to get rid of these two wraith dudes, right?"
Zac: I think that would be very helpful.
"Murph: Like, we have to figure out a way to get to them."
Zac: But they're behind null.
"Murph: They're behind. Would I just take one opportunity attack, Brennan, if we drove past this one dude and then went up and tried to kill this guy to get to the others?"
Brennan: You'd only take one opportunity attack.
Murph: I think it's worth it.
Emily: What if I position my body like a ramp? And you could just-
(everyone laughs)
Brennan: Make the jump.
Murph: Moped crashes into you so hard.
"Brennan: That drone misses on its attack, Cody."
Murph: Great. Is this one stunned?
Brennan: That one in front of you is not stunned or is it?
Emily: The one that's stunned is the one that's down from me.
"Murph: Okay, then I-"
"Brennan: Cody, you might recognize, going southbound is probably better because there won't be enough space for Ricky to fight up here even if you clear through."
"Murph: Cool, so we will go south. And Ricky, do you want to attack first so you get advantage? 'Cause I'll get advantage on the moped on the next-"
Zac: Are you fighting Null?
"Murph: No, I think we should get rid of the other guys. 'Cause they can stun us, which is terrible but they have low HP. Like, we can just get rid of them totally."
Zac: The little robots or the?
Murph: So I think we have to kill-
Emily: The wraiths.
Murph: To get it out of the way and then get the wraiths.
Zac: Okay.
"Emily: And you have haste on you, so you have tons of attacks."
Zac: My only concern is should we back out of here?
"Murph: I will say this, Cody, you have that warhorse attack. This drone is looking fucked up, the one that Sofia-"
Murph: Oh shit. I could just try to charge through it.
Zac: Yeah.
"Murph: It automatically fails strength saving throws, right?"
"Brennan: That's correct, yes."
"Murph: So, we can just run this fucker over."
"Brennan: Sure. Cody, you get on your fuckin' moped, no roll necessary. You run over this wraith."
"Cody: Fuck you! Fuck you, Gladiator!"
(everyone laughs)
Emily: Can I do like an insight check if Cody's moped came from Gladiator? If it's like a Gladiator manufacturer?
"Brennan: No, dude, this was summoned straight from hell. This is a hell moped."
"Murph: A hell-ped. Sweet, so then I will drive through that dude. And then we'll start going after the wraiths or you can attack whoever you want. I will-"
"Zac: Do we feel like this Null, this Null right in front of us is like the kind of thing where it's like a tendril like in that previous fight or like the whole thing?"
Brennan: This feels like the whole thing's trying to come through.
"Murph: I think just the more of these wraiths guys around, the more just turns of getting stunned. So, I'm just gonna-"
Zac: I'll hit this guy. I can hit the lesser dude.
"Murph: Yeah, I'll start trying to wail on him as well."
Zac: Okay. First attack.
Murph: I'm gonna great weapon master on this.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: 21 to hit on the first one.
Brennan: Yep.
Murph: I got 19 to hit.
Brennan: 19 hits.
Murph: Thank you.
Zac: And 25 on the second attack.
"Murph: And I got a bonus action. Move my hex to them, so they take the hex damage."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: 35 damage.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: Okay, I'll great weapon master. How hurt does this thing look?"
"Brennan: Hurt? It looks hurt. 35 it looks bad, yeah."
Murph: I'll great weapon master again. I want to take this thing out. Yes! That's without bless it's already a 19.
"Brennan: Yeah, you hit."
"Murph: Great. I can't move hex to this one because it's a bonus action. So, I'll just do my two d6s plus my d8 plus 20. Great weapon. I'm gonna reroll the one. I see there's a one in there."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Yeah, I got a two instead so 30 damage."
Brennan: 30 and 35. That one is hanging on by a thread.
Murph: God damn it.
(Murph sighs)
"Brennan: I will also say this. You guys both started your turns within 30 feet of Null, correct? I'm gonna need wisdom saving throws from both of you."
Emily: Advantage! Advantage Because of Misty.
Brennan: Incredible.
Zac: 18 on the die. Wisdom saving throw.
Murph: 19 flat.
Zac: Did you use bless? Are you blessed?
Murph: Yeah.
Zac: I got a 30.
"Brennan: Okay. So Cody, you're adding the paladin bonus, the bless, and Rowan's advantage? Cool. You got a 19 and what did Ricky get?"
Zac: 30.
(everyone laughs)
Ally: Incredible.
Zac: Rolled a 18.
Brennan: Start of your turn. Cody takes 40 damage.
"Zac: Yeah, I don't know that, I think we got to pull back, right? 'Cause like-"
Murph: You think so?
"Zac: If we get separated from the rest of the group on this side, we'll die."
"Brennan: So, but that wraith is hanging on by a thread."
"Murph: Let's yeah, we can always back up. Let's just kill this dude at least."
Zac: Okay.
Murph: I'm out of attacks. I got him down low.
"Zac: I got a 21, a 25, and a 30 to hit."
Brennan: All hit.
Zac: So my first attack would be two d8 plus two d6.
Brennan: Plus seven.
Zac: Plus seven?
Brennan: Yep.
"Zac: Oh, fuck. That's all twos on the die. So, two, four, six, eight plus seven. So, 15 on the first attack."
Brennan: Gone. He was by a thread.
Zac: And then-
Murph: Do we wanna-
Emily: You can use your other attacks on Null if you want.
Murph: Or this other guy. This other wraith.
"Zac: Yeah, if I can, if I step in and then come back, can we get out still?"
"Murph: Yeah, I'll moped us the fuck out of here."
"Brennan: Also at the end of Cody's turn, Null is gonna take a swing hit with the legendary action. Go ahead and give me a charisma saving throw, Cody."
(Murph sighs)
Murph: Okay. I have a lot. But I got a nat one.
(Emily groans)
"Brennan: You take eight, 10… You take 25 points of damage, and your max is reduced by that amount."
Murph: You fuckin' hate to see that.
"Brennan: Cool. Ricky, you got two attacks left."
"Zac: You know, I think I just wanna hit Null. I think I'm just gonna do that."
Brennan: Go for it.
Zac: 'Cause I worry that we won't be able to back out of here very easily.
Brennan: Cool. Cody does make a good point about how dangerous those wraiths are.
"Murph: We're not gonna kill Null in one hit is all I'm saying. You know what I mean? If the wraiths are gone, that's one less dude who can area of effect ruin all of our turns."
"Zac: I'll hit the wraith then. All right, let's do that. So that's two hits on it. That's four d8 plus four d6 plus 14."
Murph: Do you have any smites?
Zac: Let's see.
Murph: 'Cause these guys have like 60 something.
"Zac: Yeah, I'll do one first level smite."
Murph: That's smart.
Brennan: That's gonna be ten d8 plus four d6 plus 14.
Zac: 68.
Brennan: These guys have exactly 67 hit points.
Murph: Oh my God! It's so good to get rid of them.
"Brennan: Flame, lightning, and shadow fill the tunnel as Sofia, Cody, and Ricky light up these wraiths. Ricky, at the end of your turn, Null is gonna take a swing at you. That is a nat 20."
Murph: Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me a charisma saving throw, Ricky."
"Zac: Okay. Sorry, let me clear up my dice. Let's see. Where am I at? Oh great."
"Brennan: Your hit point max is not reduced, but it's still gonna do… 10 D8 plus six. Ricky, you take 41 points of damage."
"Zac: Okay. Rebuke the violence. I get it back on a short rest, so I hit him for 41."
Brennan: Oh!
Emily: Yeah! I was hopin' that might happen.
Brennan: Null is hurt by this. Stings.
"Zac: And that's, you know, like radiant damage."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Bypasses all resistances. Incredible. That is Ricky's turn. You guys got rid of those wraiths.
Zac: Can I hop back on the bike?
"Brennan: Yeah, do we want to move? I don't want to leave Sofie here to just-"
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: I'm fine. I'm worried about Dale.
Murph: Why don't we back up a little bit and give Dale the old paladin enthusiasm.
"Brennan: Yeah, if you back up more than five feet, Null's gonna get a swing on you with an opportunity attack."
"Emily: Oh,"
Brennan: I'm wrong! Reach is so bad in 5e. Null has 15 feet of reach which means you almost never leave its reach. You guys can move wherever. You guys move all the way back to Dale if you want.
"Zac: Okay, cool."
Emily: Sweet.
Murph: Let's just move back to Dale.
Brennan: Cool. Hell yes.
Emily: And then maybe you can like get in the way.
"Ally: I mean you could go even further, right, Cody?"
"Murph: Yeah, I'm pretty fucked up. But he's just gonna get an opportunity attack, so I might as well be here."
Siobhan: If you begin your round within 30 feet of him-
"Zac: Can I switch spots with you, Cody?"
Murph: Do you want to swap? Do you want to try it?
"Ally: Yeah, I mean, you guys have 15 feet of movement."
"Brennan: We're not gonna switch. The moped shenanigans have become too much. No, there's no swappin'."
(everyone laughs)
The idea of this being an effective way to fight-
"Emily: Wow, Brennan is not rooting for friendship."
Ally: Wow.
Emily: Against friendship.
"Zac: Why do you think there's no benefit to riding a moped in a tunnel, in a cave."
"Brennan: Dale rolls a natural four, is still stunned. Kingston, that is your turn."
"Lou: Okay. Kingston's gonna move, I'm worried about the flashes and bangs coming from the tunnel. And is gonna move 30 feet. But then standing here in the place where he received his powers is gonna try one more time for divine intervention."
Brennan: You are going to roll this with advantage.
"Lou: Okay. All right, here we go. First one. 15"
(Lou sighs)
Siobhan: So close.
"Brennan: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Pete, it's been, Pete-"
"Ally: Yeah, I could."
"Brennan: 15 is within, you just need a three or a four on bend luck to move that 15 to a 12. Kingston's 12th level now."
Ally: Let's do it.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Zac: Oh, it's by level."
Brennan: Yep. Roll that d4.
Rolls a 4
(everyone cheers)
Brennan: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Ally: Bend that luck!
Siobhan: The Voxes working together again.
Lou: I’m just gonna roll again just to see. The other one was 18. So we-
Emily: Yeah!
(Brennan yells)
Brennan: Oh my God! My God!
Siobhan: I love this game!
"Brennan: Kingston, you are walking, oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck."
Siobhan: I think Brennan just actually came.
Brennan: I came so hard. Don’t touch me.
"Lou: That's try number 22. In game, that's the 22nd time I've rolled."
Ally: You're right.
"Brennan: Do you know how unlikely a d4 is to be helpful on a d100 roll? Here's the deal. Kingston, you are walking to the place where you got the eternal token all those years ago. You look up and see your dear friend, Pete. You are about to have your child, and you look and think of how much your heart became open through your friendship to Pete. Pete, you look up and"
"see the Vox coming here. This is a man who's lived his whole life in service of everybody else who's gonna finally get a chance to live his dream. With a tiny bit of magic, Pete, you look down and you're just gonna, and it's just a little bit of bending luck. There's this-"
Zac: Shamrock on that guy.
"Brennan: There's a little bit of bending luck. You think about the coin that was given to you by your great, great, great grandmother in that photograph. You think about all of the things that had to get you to this point. And you see something at Kingston's feet that Kingston is one half second away from not noticing until you reach out with your reaction to bend that luck and point to it. And Kingston, underneath the tokens, you hear a muffled, ""brrr- ing, brrrr-ing. Brrr-ing, brrr-ing."""
Lou: I reach into the tokens.
"Brennan: Buried in the tokens is an ancient New York City payphone, and it's calling."
Lou: I pick it up.
"New York: Hey, Kingston. Sorry we haven't been getting your calls. What is it that you need?"
"Kingston: It's all right. I'm sure you're busy. There's something real important here for me, and for this city. And I'd give a whole lot if you'd do everything in your power to stop Null from taking it away from me."
"New York: Kingston, New York City's behind you. We got your back."
"Brennan: Throughout New York City, today is the day where the first article gets published about the coverup of that warehouse worker's murder. People are outraged, in disbelief. Phones start ringing off the hook at City Council People's Offices. People move through the streets. A brick goes through the window of the Millennium Gladiator campus, and a full-scale riot breaks out. Letters arrive at corporate headquarters of Excelsior Home Dynamics that they've been discovered for fraud and a city attorney, Liz Herrera, is going to be taking them to court. At that same time, a class action lawsuit from thousands of people in the city citing health hazards from Cipher Energy Fluid gets filed by David Kugrich. All over the city people are talking. We see mail carriers delivering letters. In an upper East Side penthouse, the woman that Kingston spoke to on the subway goes,"
"UES Lady:I really should, I'm gonna call somebody. We should get people together and do something about this."
"Brennan: In Crown Heights, Mike is talking to a bunch of other religious leaders, imams, rabbis, priests, saying,"
Mike: We need to talk to our congregations and get people together because this company is not good for this city.
"Brennan: And at a Gladiator shipping center, Josh Mendoza leads an entire warehouse full of workers off the floor in a mass spontaneous strike. The heart of the city beats. Kingston, you are glowing with more divine light than you have ever seen yourself radiate in this moment. Null is going to be defeated here. And you have never been more certain of anything in your life. For this miracle in this combat, you see Null twinge and get hurt as injunctions are filed, as people start screaming, huge public outcry, the loss of the Cloisters, the loss of Ellis Island, the loss of the carousel, the loss of homes and families and neighborhoods. The city turns against Gladiator in this moment, even though they don't recognize that magic has been done here, it has. The magic of the waking world and of this place. Here you move with the spirit of all New Yorkers behind you. All rolls for the rest of the combat will be done with advantage."
(Ally cheers)
"All rolls for the rest of the combat will be done with advantage. Additionally, this is a divine intervention. The spirit of New York reaches out. All of you are going to have resistance against all forms of damage for the rest of the combat."
(everyone laughs)
Zac: What?
Brennan: That's what I'm fucking talking about.
(Brennan laughs)
"Ally: Are, like, Perry, are like Juicy Cockroach, are their rolls going to be with advantage-"
Brennan: Advantage. All with advantage. Every role that every of you-
Emily: Except for Null though. Null doesn't roll with advantage.
"Brennan: No. Actually, you know what? This sundae, you deserve a cherry. Null will be rolling with disadvantage for the rest of the combat."
Ally: Yes!
(Emily laughs)
Murph: Oh man.
"Brennan: Make it count. When it's hard, you make it count."
"Lou: Hey, 22 times."
(Brennan laughs)
"Brennan: Oh my God, I can't fuckin' believe that!"
"Ally: Wow, that's really beautiful."
"Brennan: What the fuck? Yeah, hey Kingston, good turn."
(Brennan laughs)
"Kingston: Hey, everybody. It's gonna happen. Let's get to it."
(everyone laughs)
"Cody: Good job, Kingston. That was awesome."
(everyone laughs)
"It was really cool, yeah."
"Kingston: Wow. Cody, it's so nice to hear sincerity in your voice. It's not always there but when it is, it really means something, man."
"Brennan: Incredible. Knowing that everything is gonna be okay, JJ rushes out to the door to join the fight. After JJ, now we go back to Unicorn, Perry, and Marty. Here we go. Everyone get ready. Okay, this is Unicorn."
Rolls an 18 and a 3
18! Unicorn succeeds!
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: The Unicorn just,"
"Unicorn: Kugrash, we need you! Come back to us! Please, sweet rat Jesus!"
"Brennan: That's the unicorn. Perry's gonna go. Remember, Perry has that bardic inspiration."
Rolls a 3 and a 16
"Okay, 16."
Ally: So close.
"Brennan: But even a one puts him over! Rowan, you reach out to Perry. You reach out to Perry and he looks and says,"
"Perry: Am I doing it right? Rowan, does it seem like?"
"Rowan: You're doing fabulous, darling."
"Brennan: You see, boom."
"Perry: Kugrash, I miss you! And I really mean I miss you the person! Please come back!"
Emily: Aw!
Brennan: Last one. This one's from Marty. Just needs the higher of these two to be a 17.
Rolls a 12 and a 17
(Everyone cheers)
Murph: Oh my God!
"Brennan: Holy shit! ""Start spreading the news! Ba ba bada da dum."" We're gonna move a baby into the center of-"
Lou: You have a baby token? Y'all got a baby token?
(Shows a baby token)
Siobhan: Oh!
(Emily laughs)
"Lou: Oh damn, Kendra. Oh, Kendra, you gotta stop with that."
(everyone laughs)
"Ally: Oh, Kingston's gonna have a baby."
"Brennan: The dragon of Harlem is born. The new dragon of New York City. Doesn't know it's a dragon. Looks up to see that it is surrounded by a cockroach holding a toothpick staff, a very spicy pigeon, a unicorn, and a Faerie queen in a resplendent yellow pantsuit with a silver flag pin. The child of Kingston Brown and Liz Herrera looks up with wonder, and immediately you see the baby smile look up and begin to hear rumblings throughout the hoard. In the burlesque, every single drone explodes, disanimating and is gone. Null cringes over. The only thing keeping Null here in this moment is raw umbra. That is it. I cannot believe that that advantage led specifically to that. Rowan, that's your turn."
Siobhan: I'm gonna pick up that baby.
(everyone laughs)
Gonna pick up that baby. He's just sitting there on a pile of coins. He could eat one of those coins.
(everyone laughs)
Lou: Protect this baby at all costs.
Siobhan: I will protect this baby at all costs.
"Brennan: Our Faerie queen picks up this, how wonderful to have a sweet little mortal baby even if it's maybe deeply and profoundly magical, but-"
"Siobhan: Especially if it's deeply and profoundly magical, I think from my point of view."
"Rowan: Kingston, I'm this baby's fairy godmother. I'm just letting you know!"
Kingston: What? It happened?
"Rowan: It happened, come in here!"
(everyone laughs)
Kingston: Okay.
"Brennan: Oh my God, fairy godmother. It's perfect."
Ally: Kingston uses a legendary action.
"Lou: Yes, do I have legendary actions too?"
Ally: To run to your baby?
"Brennan: Oh my God. So the dragon being back, you see that Null is, this is the thing that repels Null. Null winces, doubles over, vomits. And the last person it ate, an unconscious Iga Lisowski, appears on the floor in front of, or appears farther away from Null in the bank vault with two failed death saves."
Ally: Right.
"Brennan: You realize the beings that Null has been devouring here in New York it's going to vomit out piece by piece until it, and then it's, this is it being destroyed. But we're going to continue moving through the initiative order-"
"Emily: Wouldn't Rowan still have, like, stuff she could do?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Rowan, you could still do stuff. Absolutely."
Siobhan: There's not an enormous amount of stuff I can do.
"Ally: Yeah, I mean the baby. That was a fine turn."
"Emily: Oh, sorry. I thought you had like cure wounds or something."
"Siobhan: I mean, I do, but like cure wounds is touch, and I'm so far away from everybody."
Emily: I see.
"Brennan: You know that this baby is not in any like danger. This baby, you guys did it. The baby is born. This baby being closer to Null hurts Null. This baby's not in any danger anymore."
"Siobhan: So, I'll take my movement towards Null then with the baby."
"Brennan: Incredible. Rowan, you pick up this sweet baby and are flanked by the spirits of New York. Marty jumps up on your shoulder, Perry flies overhead, and the unicorn trots by your side. Sofia, that's your turn."
"Emily: Okay, is this Iga right here? Yeah. Okay. Is Dale still stunned?"
Brennan: Dale is still stunned. Yes.
"Emily: Okay, can I run over here, grab Dale, and then run over and casts Kingston's cure wounds on-"
Murph: Oh my God!
Siobhan: What's his face will get an opportunity attack on me.
Brennan: That's okay. You start your turn within its annihilating aura. Give me a wisdom saving throw.
Zac: You have advantage.
"Emily: Oh my God, I got a one but also a 19! Which becomes much higher."
Brennan: You take zero damage. The DC's 21. You peace out of there. Null's gonna take an attack with disadvantage. Seven.
"Emily: If he hits me, I'll shield."
"Brennan: I believe, seven plus 13. Yes, hits you. Shield?"
"Emily: Okay, shield."
Brennan: Misses you.
"Emily: Cool, I want to grab Dale and get him out of the way of any of these people. Can I, like, do something like an athletics check or something to like-"
Brennan: You hoist your beautiful husband over your shoulder.
(Emily laughs)
"Emily: And then I cast, what did you put into my leopard print cardigan, Kingston?"
Lou: Level one cure wound.
Brennan: Level one cure wounds.
"Emily: Okay. So, I cast four plus Kingston's spell casting modifier on Iga."
Lou holds up 5 fingers
(Siobhan gasps)
"Brennan: Iga, you awaken."
Iga: What happened? What had happened? Why are we in the-
"Sofia: Iga, remember when I came in so many times and talked about my ex- husband? I mean my dead husband, this is him. Meet Dale."
"Iga: Hi, Dale, it's so nice to meet you."
(Emily laughs)
(Brennan mumbles)
Sofia: I forgot he's stunned right now.
Iga: He looks nice. He looks so nice.
"Dale: Me and my wife are chosen ones. We're the chosen two. Two chosen ones. Double, double chosen ones."
Brennan: That is Sofia's turn. Incredible!
Siobhan: Should I roll initiative?
Brennan: I have you in the initiative already.
"Siobhan: Oh, great."
"Brennan: That would have been the wraiths' turn to hit everybody, but those wraiths are gone, baby."
"Lou: Yeah, yeah!"
"Brennan: Oh my fuckin' God. Pete, that is your turn."
"Ally: I take two steps forward, and I cast disintegrate on Null. And he has disadvantage on his dex save."
Emily: Yeah!
"Brennan: Hell yes. Okay. Null, is there anything sneaky you can do? You're such an important bad guy. Hold on. Oh my God. How far away is Pete from Null?"
Ally: 60.
"Brennan: Okay, Null's gonna hit you with a counter spell. Gonna roll this with disadvantage as Null rolls everything. Disintegrate is what level?"
Ally: Six.
Brennan: Six.
Emily: Can you twin spell it and hit him twice?
Ally: I don't have the sorcery points. I would need six to do that.
"Zac: Yeah, twin spell's expensive."
Brennan: Seven. Null does not counter the spell. Uses its reaction. It's gonna roll dex save with disadvantage. The dex save here is gonna be… What does Null get? Plus four. Needs the lower of these two to be a 13.
Rolls 17 and a 4
"That's a four, baby. Failed the save."
Ally: Here comes damage!
(Brennan laughs)
81 points of damage.
(All exclaiming)
Siobhan: Oh my God.
"Brennan: Pete, you stride forward. You stride forward. What does Pete say as he hits Null square in the chest with this disintegrate?"
"Ally: I think I'm feeling extra connected to Kingston right now, and I almost feel like maybe I got a whiff of this, like, like the city is really just coming together almost like when your skin pushes out a splinter. Just like realizing something is wrong and getting rid of it, and that is the intention that I have when I'm like. Goodbye!"
Zac: Can I throw Pete the apple?
"Brennan: Pete, you hit Null deep in its chest and fill it with color. You rip a portal open in Null and heal the Sixth Borough through Null as a portal. You see the Sixth Borough comes back together, and Null vomits out its second most recent victim Nod, the gray orphan who screams into the Sixth Borough and says,"
"Nod: Thanks, Pete! I always knew you'd do it!"
(Ally laughs)
"Ally: Wow, so much energy just out of his mouth."
(Brennan laughs)
"Just got barfed out, and you're on top of the world. I love you, Nod."
"Brennan: Null has gone from being a horrifying entity of beyond to now looking hurt-hurt. Like, you are perceiving tatters and injury in the fabric of this extra dimensional being. That is going to be Iga. Oh, sorry, no, no, no. That's Null. Null goes first. Okay. Null is going to move forward into this space. Actually gonna move right here."
"Zac: Cody, did you get an opportunity attack?"
"Murph: We don't get opportunity attacks, do we?"
Brennan: You both get opportunity attacks.
Zac: I used my reaction earlier to do-
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Okay, I'm absolutely gonna go all out."
Zac: Just this once...
Emily: You have advantage remember.
Murph: Just this one time.
"Lou: Freak out on it, dude."
Murph: I'm gonna take a shot with advantage. I'm not gonna do great weapon master. That is a 24 to hit before bless. 27 to hit with bless
Brennan: 27's going to do it. Absolutely.
Murph: Sweet. And then I will do a third level divine smite.
Zac: You have a third level spell left? Oh my God.
"Emily: Ooh, let's see another person get vomited out."
"Murph: Okay, so what is, third level is five d8?"
"Brennan: Third level's five d8, yep. Or no, four d8."
"Murph: It's four d8. So it's yeah. Okay, so roll two d6 plus it's-"
Brennan: Five d8.
"Murph: It's five d8 but with improved divine smite, is it? No, you're right, it's five. Okay, five d8 plus 10."
Ally: 40.
Murph: 40 damage.
"Brennan: You slash into Null as it passes by you. A perfect infernal backstab as this thing moves by you. It is going to use a mind blast. I'm gonna need intelligence saving throws from Iga, Sofia, and Pete."
Ally: Whoa.
Brennan: All these are made with advantage.
Emily: And blessed.
Ally: It's only a plus one.
Emily: I'm definitely gonna fail.
Siobhan: 14.
Ally: 10.
"Siobhan: Oh, do I have? I don't think I do. I have nothing left from when I was-"
Ally: So that's a 10 as my first roll.
Emily: I got an eight.
"Siobhan: Okay, so to the 10 I'm gonna add a d6 which is my bless."
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: So that's 12.
Brennan: Okay.
(Emily laughs)
Emily: Say it in an excited way and hopefully you'll trick Brennan into thinking-
"Siobhan: Oh, so that's 12. Oh cool, that's 12."
Emily: I actually got an eight.
Ally: That's actually pretty good. That's a 12.
"Brennan: Okay. So Sofia, Pete, what did Sofia get?"
Emily: Eight.
Brennan: Eight. Pete got 12. Dale also failed. what did Iga get?
Siobhan: 14.
"Brennan: 14\. Okay. You feel this thing reaching out. You can either, again, choose to give in to the stunned effect or give up one of your six ability scores."
Emily: I'll give up my strength.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I'm giving up my strength as well. Nothing I need for strength."
Brennan: So everyone there is going to take 22 damage.
Siobhan: I'm down again.
"Emily: It's okay, but at least you don't have two death saves now."
Siobhan: Yes.
"Ally: Ooh, that was fun to watch, barely anything get taken away because of that temp HP."
Brennan: Love that.
Ally: I will also do strength as well.
Brennan: All of you feel that Null feels itself losing its grasp on New York. It knows it's being driven out into the deeper dreaming. It's not about New York anymore. It's about taking you out to the deep sea with it.
Emily: Oh.
"Brennan: It is saying, ""if you will drive me out, I will make you pay."" And you give up your strength. Dale-"
Emily: Dale is already stunned.
"Brennan: Already stunned. He stays stunned, yeah."
"Ally: Oh. Is this the first? Yeah, this is the first time I've been hit. I think I have to roll for concentration for that banishment."
"Brennan: Yes, go for it."
Ally: Is that with advantage as well?
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys only roll with advantage because of Kingston now."
"Ally: Absolutely incredible. That's a nine. Hell yeah, that's 18."
"Brennan: You maintain concentration. That's the end of Null's turn. Iga, that's you."
Siobhan: I roll a death save.
Brennan: You roll with advantage by the way.
Ally: Incredible.
Brennan: Everything rolled with advantage.
Siobhan: 18.
Brennan: That is a success. Next up is going to be Esther. Esther is going to run up. She's going to double up on chain lightning.
Murph: Nice.
"Brennan: Hits Null for 55 points, halved 'cause Null makes the save even with disadvantage."
"Zac: Oh, were people taking a half damage on the magic?"
"Brennan: Oh shit, everyone should've taken half damage on that attack because you all have resistance to damage."
Siobhan: I still would have gone down.
"Brennan: Cool, cool. And Esther fries these drones behind with the chain lightning. Cody, that's gonna be you."
Murph: Sweet. Let's go kick this thing's ass. Let's take the moped. Drive it dangerously close to this portal.
(everyone laughs)
And takes-
Ricky: Just be so careful. Just be so careful.
(Murph laughs)
(Murph yells)
"Murph: I'm going to, believe it or not, go all out again."
Brennan: Incredible.
Lou: Freak out on them.
"Murph: Actually, no, you know what? I'm not gonna… I only have two slots left, so I'll smite on each one if I hit. So, I will make my first attack. That is a 20 to hit. Plus a blessed 21. Sweet. I will do last third level spell slot..."
Lou: My man was just hangin'.
Murph: It was five d8 we said?
Brennan: Yep.
"Murph: Plus two d6. Oh, I'll move my hex to Null to make it three d6 and then plus 10."
"Brennan: Jesus. 40 damage, you fuck Null up. Go ahead and roll again."
"Murph: Okay. That one is a, that's even higher to hit. That's like a nat 16. So like 26."
"Brennan: 26 to hit? Yeah, you hit. Go for it."
"Murph: Yeah, okay. And then the last one, second level smite, my last spell. So that's four d8 plus three d6. Another 40."
(Brennan sighs)
"Brennan: Cody, what is Cody looking like as he lays into this monstrosity?"
"Cody: Gladiator, get the fuck out of our city, you fucking piece of shit!"
Murph: I throw a Big Gulp into the portal.
(Brennan laughs)
"Brennan: Ricky. Oh, I'm gonna need wisdom saves from Ricky and Cody by the way."
"Siobhan: Advantage. Oh, unless you've taken more than 20."
Lou: Still advantage.
"Zac: We still have advantage, right?"
"Siobhan: Oh yeah, you have advantage anyway."
Lou: Advantage no matter what.
Siobhan: No matter what.
Lou: The gods are on our side.
Zac: 18.
Murph: 28.
"Brennan: 28, 18 for Ricky?"
Zac: Yes.
"Brennan: Okay. Ricky, at the beginning of your turn, you are gonna take ten d6 psychic damage."
Zac: Is this gonna be halved?
Brennan: This is gonna be halved. You take 15 points of damage.
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: What's Ricky at right now?
Zac: Ricky is at 70.
(everyone laughs)
"Murph: Oh my God, so tough."
"Brennan: Fun and fancy free, baby. Cool, Ricky, take your turn."
"Zac: Ricky's going to step in to Null, but step past Null to right here. And he is going to, you know, two sides of the same coin, fire and ice."
(Murph laughs)
"Take three attacks on Null with advantage, right?"
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Zac: Like, a 26 on the first one."
Brennan: That hits.
Zac: 23 without bless.
Brennan: 23's gonna hit.
"Zac: And then last one is, was really hoping I would crit, was a 20. With bless that would be a 24."
"Brennan: Yeah, you hit all three times."
"Zac: Okay. Oh, I'm gonna hit my stopwatch first, and I'm gonna use lay on hands on Iga to give her 20 HP."
(Brennan gasps)
Brennan: Hell yes.
Murph: Brilliant.
"Zac: And then I'll do my attack, so I don't know if that matters?"
"Brennan: It does. Yes, absolutely."
Zac: And so that would be-
Siobhan: My max HP is 19. So he could give me fewer than that.
Ally: Forgot about that.
Zac: I'll give you 19.
Siobhan: Great.
"Zac: What is this gonna be? Six d6 of lightning damage plus, and I'm gonna divine smite as well. And that's my last first level spell slot. So that's… Four d8 plus Four d8, right? It's eight d8."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: Plus 21.
Brennan: Jesus Christ.
(everyone laughs)
Zac: 92
Ally: That's such a good roll!
Murph: Such a sick combo.
Zac: Oh my God. Pretty good rolls. Pretty good rolls.
Lou: Wow.
"Ally: I'm feet away, and I just go,"
Pete: Fire 'n ice.
(everyone laughs)
Siobhan: It's like that gum.
Ally: Just like that gum.
"Brennan: Cody and Ricky, Null is being just, ping ponging back and forth between your blades. You've done 80 and 92 points of damage to this thing. It is hanging on by the barest of tatters. At the end of each of your turns, it's gonna take swings with disadvantage. Misses Ricky bad. Hits Cody. Cody, go ahead. You take 11, Cody, you take 25 points of damage."
"Murph: Halved, right?"
"Brennan: Halved, yes."
Murph: Okay. So 12?
"Brennan: 12, that's correct. I'm gonna say-"
Murph: I love the idea of doing like a cool-ass combo and still like looking the other way. And then just getting punched in the back of the head.
(everyone laughs)
"Cody: Oh, fuck!"
"Brennan: I'm gonna say, because Sofia and Ricky both cast healing spells on Iga, I am going to let Iga reroll initiative for this combat. Go ahead and roll initiative right now."
Siobhan: Okay. 21. I rolled a nat 20. Useless nat 20.
"Brennan: I love it. Iga, you flicker wake up. You may act before these delivery drones act. There's the last couple in the hall here charging. You see them charging. You see Null is looking fucked up. It is your turn."
"Siobhan: Well, if Null is looking fucked up then I will Eldritch blast Null."
Brennan: Hell yes. Go for it.
"Iga: You think you can put me in some gray void for an unspecified length of time that I don't really, I don't, I'm gonna hit you."
"Siobhan: Wait, with advantage. I mean, I think they all hit anyway. I got, like, 21 is my lowest."
Brennan: Incredible.
Siobhan: Let me just make sure that I don't crit. I do not. So that's roll three d10 plus 19.
Lou: Okay.
Siobhan: 43 damage. How's it lookin'?
"Brennan: Iga, you stand to your feet, and this thing that had imprisoned you, you stand up healed, look past Sofia and hit Null. You see a gate opens up behind you. A young boy with a sword and a portal opened by a young wizard opens up behind you as Nick and Jess rush out behind you. Jess covers you in an abjurative ward as Nick rushes forward with his sword and says,"
"Nick: Get away from my mom, you creep!"
Brennan: And all the stories that were and all the stories that will be flash out of you into Null. I'm gonna write down how many hit points Null has left on a piece of paper right now. 'Cause it's an absolutely goofy fucking number.
"Siobhan: In which case, I press my watch."
(Brennan laughs)
"And I go again and as I'm shooting these Eldritch blasts, I say to Null,"
Iga: Once upon a time there was a man who dreamed of having a child.
"Siobhan: Two of those hit. Let's see if with advantage. Oh yeah, I hit three times."
Brennan holds up a piece of paper but the digital background blocks it out
Brennan: One hit point left.
Siobhan: We cannot see it.
(everyone laughs)
Absolutely not.
Lou: It's not there.
Emily: We can't see it. We really can't see it.
Brennan moves the paper back so you can see the paper but not what is written on it
"Brennan: Oh, here it is. One."
Lou: You gotta use a thicker marker.
Emily: The insinuation was there that it was gonna be one.
(everyone laughs)
"Brennan: Null is blasted into the deep dreaming as Eldritch blasts. The power of story reaches out sending Null spiraling through space. As it convulses in its death throes, we are going to end this round of combat. Dale is going to roll his save. On a nat 20 Dale comes out of stunned!"
Emily: Yay! How's he looking?
"Sofia: Hon, please eat this apple."
"Dale: Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Kingston, you're our last PC in the initiative order for this round. You see Iga putting the final death blow on Null. You hear a couple of drones behind. There's four drones left in the hallway. What does Kingston do?"
"Lou: I think there's just like a moment, 'cause like I can see everyone now, like everyone's in the room where I think Kingston just looks at all of his friends who fought so hard, one, for the city, but also for this dream. And then I think he turns around and looks at JJ and is like,"
"Kingston: Hey man, will you film this? Liz is going to be so mad if I don't film this."
"Brennan: JJ screens up a little cantrip. He's like,"
JJ: Got it. Do you want me to focus on the extra planar being being banished back to the depths of dreaming or you and the baby?
"Kingston: Me and the baby. I don't think Liz, is just, I'm just gonna tell Liz that we beat Null. This is the important part."
"Brennan: Rowan emerges from the vault followed by the three spirits of New York. And I think also by a scintillating bit of starlight as the totems summon Kugrash himself who appears in this moment. Kingston, you see Rowan walk out with the sweetest baby in the world."
Kingston: That him or her? I'm not sure.
Rowan: You want me to check?
"Kingston: I just, I don't know. I don't know. Just bring him."
"Ally: From the other room I yell,"
Pete: Gender is a construct!
Kingston: I know that! I said it and then I didn't know.
"Pete: Fuckin' essentialist ass baby. Holy motherfucker. What, are you gonna have a gender reveal party, Kingston?"
"Kingston: No, I'm not gonna have a gender reveal party!"
"Pete: With pink fireworks, motherfucker!"
"Kingston: I'm sorry! I never thought I'd have a child and here it is, okay? I'm sorry. I've falling back into my ways. You know I'm working on it!"
Brennan: Null vanishes in this moment.
(everyone laughs)
"Ally: Null's like, “That's a lot. Loaded”"
(everyone laughs)
"Brennan: All of you gather here in the antechamber of the hoard of the Dragon of Bleecker Street. You see Rowan has the baby and approaches Kingston flanked by these three spirits and the scintillating spirit of Kugrash behind them. Cody and Ricky, your weapons still fiery. Sofia still over Dale's body. Iga, you have your two children here. Esther rushes over to Ricky. Pete, you're still here. And JJ is filming the whole thing. You are gathered here. Kingston, you look down at your baby who looks up at you, and though this baby does not have a internal appreciation of gender at this moment because it is in fact a baby, the child that will grow into your son is handed into your arms."
"Lou: Yeah, I hold him. And I guess I,"
Kingston: Hello? Hello? Hello?
Brennan: The baby-
Kingston: Is this what you do with a baby? I don't know what's happening right now.
"Emily: Sofia's horrified 'cause if the baby speaks, that's terrifying."
"Lou: I think there's also, that's what's going through Kingston's head is that at any moment the baby could like go full dragon. Like, it's having like flashbacks to the dragon queen turning into a big dragon. He's just kind of holding it, like honestly like waiting for the baby to make the first move."
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me an insight check, Kingston."
"Lou: Insight check on this baby. That's gonna be, I got a 29 on an insight check for this baby."
"Brennan: This baby is looking up at you and reaches its hands out and just grabs with like surprisingly strong little baby hands, just grabs at your face, starts to like, is just interested in your mouth and your face. And on a 29 insight check, you remember what Kugrash said was the thing that the Dragon of Bleecker Street most regretted, which was that it didn't live a human life and so didn't understand the importance of human people. And you look at a baby that should probably one day understand that it is a spirit that is healing and protecting New York by its very presence. But that it might not need to know that for many years and probably would be a lot better at doing his magical job if he knew what it was like to lead a normal human life."
"Lou: Ah, I think with that, like, going through my head, I think I just hold the baby. Oh, man."
"Kingston: You don't and I don't even know what you're going to become, but for now you're mine. Hey, I want you all to meet Langston Brown."
Ally: Oh!
"Lou: And I just start walking him around and being like,"
"Kingston: All right, so this is your fairy godmother, Rowan."
(everyone laughs)
Siobhan: I kiss him because it's part of my job. It's the best part of my job is kissing babies.
"Kingston: This is your Uncle Dale. Who we didn't know if you were gonna have an uncle Dale until today, but you are."
(everyone laughs)
"Brennan: You all gather together around adorable Langston. Triumphant, light gleaming everywhere. You see as Langston is named, he smiles. He looks kinda tired. It's been a big day and he leans his head and just closes his eyes and is calm here. And you see as Langston exhales the hoard glitters. History appears. You see the hoard comes to life. Coins whip everywhere. The last four drones are shredded by subway tokens as you all witness this miracle. Kingston, you know that you'll always be able to find this subway station. And one day years from now, it'll probably fall to you to show it to Langston. But right now Langston's just asleep on your shoulder."
"Lou: On my, oh, like this. Not like, I thought-"
Emily: Like a fireman carry
Ally: Like a bird.
Lou: Is this how y'all carry a baby?
(everyone laughs)
"Emily: I don't know, maybe."
"Brennan: You look out. You see the three spirits come over. Marty goes,"
"Marty: Hey, look at that fuckin' kid. Look at that little dragon."
"Kingston: Hey Marty. Marty, can you watch your language just a little bit? I mean-"
"Marty: Oh, shit. Yeah, fuck, I'm sorry."
"Sfoia: Wait, do we all have to watch our fuckin' language?"
"Kingston: I mean, hey-"
Rowan: I'm not watching my fucking language.
"Cody: Oh, shit, I'm sorry, Kingston."
Ricky: I'm gonna watch my language.
"Cody: Shit, I'm sorry, Langston. I'm sorry, Kingston."
"Brennan: You see Perry goes over and goes,"
"Perry: If ever the child needs anything, I'm here reporting for duty. I'm glad the city has a spicy pigeon again."
"Brennan: And the unicorn smiles as well says,"
Unicorn: Happy for all of us to be able to watch over.
"Brennan: And you see all of them look for a moment like they could fade back now that their magic has, like, returned to hatch this new dragon into the world. But they also look up at Kugrash floating there for a moment. And I will leave it up to Kugrash if you think, you see these three spirits gathered here, and the question remains about like, if these three spirits should be left here to tend to the people of New York City. And if so, who if anyone would like hold Kugrash's mantle? But I think Kugrash you're also here, like, looking over Langston and these three spirits as well."
"Murph: Yeah, I think first things first, I think Kugrash the starry shitty rat I think is gonna just kinda look over the whole scene and go,"
"Kugrash: Congratulations, Kingston. It's just about the most beautiful God damn thing I've ever seen, and I've literally seen everything."
(everyone laughs)
"Kingston: Well, thank you for being here. I can't imagine doing this without you and literally could not have done this without you."
"Kugrash: Hey, literally I wouldn't exist if it weren't for you and for everybody here. Kingston, what do you think about the spicy pigeon, the juicy cockroach, and the unicorn? You think they should stick around or?"
"Kingston: Hey, not to keep pimpin' this decision off to people, but I mean, Ricky, you feel like you have the most connection to these three beings."
Ricky: Oh gosh.
"Sofia: Ricky, I wanted to say, I know you don't love the aesthetic of-"
Kugrash: I know you're not loving the aesthetic.
"Sofia: I'm sure Kugrash already knows I was gonna offer this 'cause he knows everything. I'll take over the mantle 'cause I know it's not your style, if you want that."
"Ricky: Sorry, you would take the mantle? Is that what you're saying?"
Sofia: Yeah 'cause I know you weren't. at least you didn't overtly seemed too jazzed about it.
"Zac: Ricky's like trying to decide if that is rude, but desperately wants that to be true."
(everyone laughs)
Kugrash: You absolutely can't trick me.
"Emily: Sofia reads this and then says,"
"Sofia: Actually, Ricky, you know what? It's something I selfishly have desired for myself. When it first happened to you I felt so covetous. It was disgusting feeling. Oh, I wish for this mantle. Please, Ricky, please! I am but a pregnant woman reduced to desperation."
Zac: Ricky bows.
Ricky: If you must. Please take it.
"Kugrash: Yeah, Marty."
Murph: I turn to the juicy cockroach.
Kugrash: You wouldn't happen to be looking for a First Fist of the Order of Rat Jesus would you?
"Marty: Oh shit, yeah! Hey Sofia, you wanna be First Fist of our fuckin' hot dog cart?"
"Sofia: Yeah, yeah. As long as Dale doesn't think less of me."
"Brennan: Dale looks over and says,"
"Dale: Sweetheart, why would I think less of you?"
"Sofia: Well, it's gonna be a brutal commute 'cause I'm gonna have to go all the way up to Grand Central Terminal, get turned tiny just to go into work."
"Dale: Gotcha, well that is a shlep for sure."
Sofia: Yeah.
Kugrash: They could probably just call on you. Everything's very magical. You don't have to like go in every day necessarily.
"Brennan: You see that, Sofia, you are surrounded by the spirit of the unicorn, the spicy pigeon, and the juicy cockroach. Unicorn says,"
"Unicorn: As long as someone is here to tend to the forgotten of New York, we will be there at their side."
"Brennan: Perry says,"
"Perry: It's very fitting. I know that you and Kugrash were very close, so it feels beautiful honestly."
"Brennan: Marty says,"
"Marty:Yeah also, we don't know shit about karate, so if you could just-"
(everyone laughs)
Sofia: I will teach you self defense. We'll start with that and then we can go to offense.
"Marty: Okay, we don't know fuckin' dick about shit, so that's great."
Murph: I think also Kugrash-
"Sofia: I need a boon though. I'm gonna need a fuckin' boon from you, Kugrash. Kugrash, I'm a wife and a soon to be mother, I can't smell like shit."
(Brennan and Siobhan laugh)
"Kugrash: All right, one last time."
Murph: And I would like to give her very sweet smelling trash bag shoes.
(everyone laughs)
Brennan: You get those like pre Febreezed trash bags.
"Kugrash: Oh, these are good trash bags, Sof. Congratulations."
"Murph: I also do want to say to Ricky as Kugrash, I think like just to like him in his head I wanna be like,"
"Kugrash: And thanks for carrying on my legacy, Ricky. I look forward to you continuing it. but you don't have to hang out with a pigeon."
"Ricky: Yeah, I just wanted to be-"
"Kugrash: A cockroach. Yeah, yeah."
Ricky: I definitely still want to help. I just don't know that-
Kugrash: You don't love the aesthetics. You don't love that side of it. That's cool.
Ricky: That's true.
Kugrash: It's all right.
"Brennan: The three spirits swirl around young Langston, swirl around Sofia as well. Someone who will not only protect the people in the city that need protecting and help people in the city that need helping, but also by attending to those people, keep the city even more secure against the encroachment of beings like Null. The spirits bless Sofia. Kugrash vanishes on the wind. Dale smiles-"
"Sofia: Can I just, like, mostly get the smell of the unicorn?"
(everyone laughs)
I'm really concerned about this.
Ally: The smell of a horse?
Siobhan: Bath and Body spray.
"Murph: Yeah, in addition to the bags, I just, I spray the unicorn with like a powerful cologne to overpower the cockroach and the spicy pigeon."
"Brennan: Incredible, beautiful, triumphant. Iga, your two kids latch onto you, hugging you so tightly. Esther comes over to you, Ricky, and smiles and says,"
"Esther: You were awesome, sweetheart. That was-"
"Ricky: I mean, you're having a baby. We're having a baby."
Esther: I wanted to talk to you about it. I would like to have a baby. And I think that would be wonderful for our lives.
Ricky: I think that'd be wonderful too.
"Iga: Esther, if you want to go jewelry shopping with me."
(Emily laughs)
I don't think he's gonna get it on his own.
Ricky: Can I ask a question? Why do people keep talking about jewelry?
(everyone laughs)
"Iga: Like, I say. I don't think he's gonna get it on his own."
Ally: I look at Ricky and I'm like. (pointing to ring finger)
Zac: Ricky tries to rip the apple in half like it's a ring box.
(Zac laughs)
"Brennan: You rip the apple in half, there's a beautiful engagement ring inside the apple."
(everyone laughs)
Zac: I knew it.
"Brennan: Esther screams. She says,"
"Esther: Yes, I do! I say yes! How did you know there would be a ring in there?"
Ricky: I had a dream.
(everyone laughs)
"Emily: I turn to Dale and I say,"
Sofia: Spit out the apple. Spit out the apple.
"Brennan: He says,"
Dale: Oh.
"Brennan: And you see, he spits it out, it's just one of your guys' wedding rings. And he's like,"
Dale: How'd that get in the apple?
Sofia: I don't know.
"Brennan: Incredible. Much merriment is had. New York is saved. You guys leave from this place. As you walk out the hall, you hear Tammany calls out after you,"
Tammany: Good luck out there. Congrats to everybody.
Emily: I punch him.
(everyone laughs)
"Tammany: Ow, that's a real firecracker of a lady I tell ya. I'll be waiting. I'll always be waiting. Season three!"
(everyone laughs)
Sofia: I'm sorry I have no context for that.
Ally: Like a bird cage.
Emily: I don't understand.
Lou: It's in a cage.
"Brennan: You guys all walk out, and we're gonna cut into the epilogue of our beautiful story here. Kingston's divine intervention continues to manifest through the holidays, into the new year. Enormous demonstrations happen every day until eventually it gets to a point where the public sabotage, just like neighborhood kids putting bricks through windows. The huge public relations disaster. And it gets to the point where Gladiator retreats from the Millennium campus and does not go forward with plans to demolish the Queens Center Mall and abandons it to slink off into the shadows. And though that arm of Null is still out there in the world, New York is safe and the good work continues. Cody, the plans for the Queens Center Mall, it is still shut down. You feel Kingston's divine intervention as Vox Populi working for the city. And you with your sort of infernal sense can feel it moving the Queens Center Mall away from going back to being a mall again, towards something else. What does Cody do with that?"
"Murph: I think Cody would like to, through magical means or otherwise, try to help bring back Fairyland."
"Brennan: Cody, you meet again with Lucifer after the fight. Lucifer, first of all removes the Jersey Devil from your soul. And says,"
Lucifer: This guy's a fuckin' douchebag.
Brennan: And flings him back.
Cody: You're so fuckin' powerful you can just flick away devils. It's awesome.
"Brennan: Jersey Devil says,"
"Jersey Devil: Bro, I'm gonna go fuck up that Cipher plant in the Pine Barrens, dude. You're right. I fuckin' talked to Bazathrax. Fuckin' it sucks that there's that fuckin' plant there. I'm gonna get people, we're gonna fuckin' roll squad deep on that shit, dude."
"Cody: That's a solid plan. That's actually super solid. Thank you, Jersey Devil."
"Jersey Devil: Yeah, man, Bazathrax talked me through it. You got a good effect on that guy, dude. We were doing monster bong rips in your soul."
(everyone laughs)
"Cody: All right, cool. Thanks, Bazathrax."
(everyone laughs)
"Yeah, go ahead. Go do it. Get the fuck outta here, dude."
"Brennan: Yeah, Bazathrax says,"
"Bazathraz: Yeah, dude, you know, you rubbed off on me, dude. Like, Gladiator is shit, dude. It's fuckin' shit, dude. They don't want you and your friends to talk about real good wrestlers or real good music and fuckin' do monster bong rips in the fuckin' rec room."
"Cody: That one's more you, but yeah, totally. That last one is just you, yeah."
"Bazathrax: Yeah, for sure, dude. All right, listen, I could hit up some people to come into the city this weekend if you want. I know some real fucked up losers who could come in and show us a real good time."
(everyone laughs)
"Yeah, I learned my lesson, dude. I learned. I learned my lesson."
"Brennan: And Cody, I think Cody goes to some city council meetings and some public hearings with real estate developers alongside Kingston. And Cody, I think you meet up on a night, probably like, you know, like a couple, maybe like two years after the events of this. And we'll move a couple of years into the future here. This is some heavy downtime. The nice thing was Fairyland took up way less space than the entire Queens Center Mall which means that this area is picked for, has a lot of housing come"
"back to the neighborhood. And there's a bunch of housing here. A lot of which is given out to people in need. And Rusty, Ricky's old friend from Helping Hands, finds himself living in one of the apartments here for the homeless that just\- is given city housing. He smiles and on the day that Fairyland is rechristened, everyone in the neighborhood gets this beloved old amusement park back. And you see that, Rowan, you finally have established your entryway into Queens here for your new Fae realm in this wonderful amusement park where kids can come and feel that touch of fairy excitement and whimsy right around the corner from their own home."
"Rowan: And it's an up and coming kind of a borough. You know, it's got some heat. Manhattan is dead. Nobody wants to be in Manhattan anymore. It's full of bankers and boring people."
Zac: Please don't gentrify it.
(everyone laughs)
Murph: Cody get’s ready to throw a Big Gulp at Rowan.
(everyone laughs)
"I also think, I think Cody fully works at Fairyland 'cause he definitely has the energy of like dude who runs the rollercoaster and is like,"
"Cody: You know, I can make it go fast as fuck if you want."
(everyone laughs)
Ally: That's so real.
Brennan: Cody the Night Angel is definitely a carny at Fairyland. And you-
"Ally: Everyone you work with is so goth and sick to you. That guy rules. Oh my god, that girl rules."
"Murph: I think I also make sure that my roommate Josh is alive. I think that's like day one all of this ends of just like,"
Cody: Hey you there? LOL.
Brennan: You and Josh are great.
Murph: Still good? Still alive?
"Brennan: Josh gets saved by the same divine intervention. He's actually got involved in labor organizing and is now helping warehouse workers all over the city unionize their workplace. Josh moves into Lars and Brita's room. So now you each also have your own room, but are still roomies in the Astoria spot. Incredible. I love goth carny! The rollercoaster you operate is called Hell's Mouth. And the roller coaster starts by going into a big devil's open mouth, which is, I think Rowan would observe the old rule of Faerie tithing to Hell, right? The old Fae tradition. And so there's one hell gate, and you're the operator for that ride."
Murph: I send people to hell sometimes just for like real quick.
Brennan: Just super quick.
"Zac: When anyone throws up on a roller coaster, they went to hell."
(everyone laughs)
"Brennan: I think it's like two years later, two to three years later. It is a beautiful day in Central Park. Kingston, it's a hot summer, baby. You haven't had it, not since like 1994 when you were out walking around on that hot summer. It's hot again. But there's a huge family barbecue up in Central Park. People are cooking and laughing and there's food everywhere. They're running around. Big news which was a huge public push of public restoration campaign, mass demonstrations, sort of angry New Yorkers. They ran out the old mayor, and the new mayor came in and ended up saving the Central Park carousel which is no longer the Cipher Energy Fluid Presents Gladiator Industries Recreational Rotating Horse area. That is now the Central Park carousel again. The unicorn tapestries got returned to the Cloisters, and Ellis Island, the exhibit is much, much improved. You all approach this beautiful barbecue, this beautiful like summer day lunch. Yeah, it's about two years later. Who gets to the barbecue first that day?"
Lou: I think Kingston gets there good and early to start cooking.
"Brennan: Kingston, you are having a ball of a time cooking. Liz is there. She's got big old sunglasses on, gives you a kiss. She's still deep in, she's moved on from the Don Confetti stuff and is going hard after criminal fraud stuff from Gladiator executives. But she smiles. You see, she's got Langston in her arms who's now talking. He's verbal. You see your adorable sweet little son as he is often fond of doing, asking you questions about stories and the city and is asking you all about what this place is and who these people are. And is just smiling and laughing."
"Lou: Yeah. I think Kingston is just like cooking up hot dogs. And being like,"
"Kingston: Well you just gotta remember, you know, it was the 70s so-"
(everyone laughs)
"It was kinda like, you know, out there kind of doing their own thing."
"Lou: Like, talking to Langston like he's like a full adult. There's no like kid, like, I'm telling him a full adult story at all times."
"Brennan: Langston watches you with more fascination as you tell these stories than he could at all. He looks up at you after he takes a moment to run around and play with some of the other kids and runs back and hears you telling other stories. You see Cosmo's here, Suzette's here, Tanya's here, your mom and dad are here, Claude and his family are here. And even your cousin Janiece comes in with the family from Ithaca."
Kingston: Down from Ithaca. We finally got you here!
"Brennan: She smiles and laughs. She says,"
Janiece: Well I knew we weren't gonna get you out there.
"Brennan: And she smiles, laughs. And Langston runs up for another story. He's got a huge popsicle. His whole face is just popsicle as little three-year-old kids are want to have sticky hands. And as you tell another wild story about something from the past, he looks up and says,"
"Langston: Dad, I love it when you tell me stories about stuff that's not here anymore."
"Kingston: Hey, well, you know, just 'cause it's not here doesn't mean it wasn't important. And you know, 8-track was, at least for me, the best way to listen to music. Now I appreciate vinyl, but there's just something about 8-track. Now if you'll remember"
(Brennan laughs)
"Brennan: Langston hangs off of every word, and you feel at this moment just complete love for your young son. But know one day, as Kingston once said about Jackson back in the 90s, you feel the power coming from your young son. One day this kid is gonna be a force to be reckoned with. Who gets to the barbecue next?"
"Ally: I mean, I'm definitely there."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Does Pete roll up with anybody?
"Ally: I mean, it would be awesome if I was with somebody."
Brennan: I think Pete rolls up to the park with Maddie.
Ally: Incredible.
"Lou: Wow, two years going strong."
Ally: Yeah. Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah. What do you think Pete's living situation is like these days? Do you think he's still living in the attic in Astoria?
Ally: Absolutely.
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Murph: And then I'm on a moped, like, not far behind."
(everyone laughs)
"Ally: We were like,"
Pete: We're gonna grab coffee. We'll meet you there.
"Ally: But then we just ended up being, like, on every train together."
Brennan: Incredible
Murph: The moped is so slow that I still rode the whole time. But got there like a little bit after you.
(everyone laughs)
"Brennan: Oh my God. Yeah, Pete, you walk up. Maddie's got her arm around you. She's got her thick sunglasses on, denim shorts. Hot summer day. At this point, you all know Maddie. She's super psyched to be here. And Pete walks up. I think Pete, how's Pete doing two years later?"
"Ally: Oh, baby. I think, okay. I'm not sure where he got the money. I have a feeling I know someone who would want to give him money for this, but he wants to open a bookstore and tea shop of his own."
Brennan: Hell yes.
Ally: So yeah. He runs… Scales Book and Tea Shop.
"Brennan: Oh, I love that. You know what? At the city, again, the rolling from that, the answering of New York to the call in its moment of need. And the fact that Pete was part of that miracle. Pete, you get a heavy grant to open this bookshop. And I think part of it is, if Pete's down, is like an educational grant."
"Ally: Exactly, I was totally thinking. There's an art annex for, like, teens. And we do, like, mural projects around the city. So, I think we're just like putting up these amazing murals. And there's definitely a mural that says"
“No day shall erase you from the memory of time.”
"Brennan: You take a bunch of awesome kids that are in, like, an afterschool program that you're running where they're like getting in touch with themselves and getting in touch with their dreams, what they want to make happen for themselves in their lives. And they paint this mural that says “no day shall erase you from the memory of time.” And put a bunch of awesome stars in it. And without even having to talk to them, you see a little scintillating constellation almost in the shape of a rat up in the corner."
(everyone laughs)
"Incredible. Pete, you roll up. You hear a cry of running up as a kid latches onto your leg."
Langston: Uncle Pete!
Pete: There's my guy!
Ally: I swoop him up.
(everyone laughs)
"Brennan: Langston is up in your arms a second later. This kid's not gonna hit the ground for a while, baby."
"Ally: I do that thing where I'm like running around really fast, and it's really fun for the kid, but I'm immediately exhausted. And they're like, ""Again!"" And you're like, ""I can't do it a second time."" And they're like, ""Again!"" And you're like, ""I don't know if I can."""
(everyone laughs)
Brennan: I love that. Who gets to the barbecue next?
Siobhan: I think Iga probably shows up with like so much food. Just an overwhelming amount of food.
"Kingston: Iga, I told you I was gonna cook."
"Iga: No, I know. But you know, it's rude to come without food."
"Kingston: Okay, but you brought like a feast."
"Iga: It's just a few snacks, what are you talking about?"
Siobhan: There's like eight trays of food.
Iga: A pierogi's a snack. Stuffed cabbage is a snack. What are you talking about?
"Kingston: Of course I'm thankful for it, but-"
"Iga: A side of beef, it's a snack."
Kingston: Side of beef?
Iga: It has been cooking for five days!
(everyone laughs)
Kingston: Okay.
"Brennan: You see Nick and Jess both roll up. Nick's now 16 years old. Nick is looking like broad shouldered. He rolls up with a little bit of umbral arcana around his back, hiding the peasant sword on his back. He's getting a little bit of like facial hair coming in. 14 year old Jess is there. You see she very quick FaceTimes Ana and Amelia who are in their coffins 'cause it's daylight right now. But they're both like,"
"Jess: Hey, are we hanging out tonight? So fun. That's gonna be awesome. Later."
"Brennan: Iga, you're there with Oskar as well. Start setting up. Your whole family's here. What's Iga doing two years later?"
"Siobhan: I think she's probably still reading tarot but has, like, still like lightly scamming people. But really only people that, like, she's making more of a concerted effort to actually help people through the readings instead of just using it to scam. And I think that she's also has like a storytelling night at Pete's bookshop."
"Ally: Oh, definitely. There's a whole section about Poland in this book shop."
"Siobhan: And she just like sits and tells stories about dragons and like minor illusions, pictures of princesses, and castles, and knights in armor, and all of these fantastical adventures."
"Brennan: Oh God, it's beautiful. I love it. Who shows up at the barbecue next?"
"Zac: I feel like Ricky would show up around now or maybe the whole family unit. Ricky, Esther."
Lou: The unit.
"Zac: And I think he's got a baby bjorn. Is that too old, a two year old in one of those things? That's not too old."
(Emily laughs)
"Lou: I mean, on Ricky? Yeah."
"Zac: It's fine, right?"
Siobhan: Probably want him on the subway to (laughs)
"Zac: I think they have a little, like, a daughter named Al."
"Brennan: Oh, I love that."
"Zac: After Alejandro. Just kind of roll out instead of his bat, he's got like a wiffle ball bat and a little wiffle ball."
Brennan: Settin' up some wiffle ball. Hell yeah!
"Ricky: I mean, I'm just, we don't have to play."
Iga: Nick is very good.
Pete: I'd love to play actually.
"Cody: I'm really bad and uncoordinated, but I'll do it, yeah."
Ricky: You don't have to be good. You don't have to be good.
"Kingston: You brought extra balls, right?"
"Cody: I can swing super hard is the thing. I can swing super hard, I just can't hit."
"Zac: Ricky has a like (laughs) Ricky has like an afterschool, like, you know, exercise kind of athletics program. Like, he's mostly stay at home dad but has like an afterschool like sport thing called “You Don't Have To Be Good”."
(everyone laughs)
Just run around or whatever.
Ally: Oh my God.
Lou: Ricky and just a bunch of kids.
"Brennan: I love it. I love it so much. “You Don't Have To Be Good”. I mean, it's perfect. Ricky doing a bunch of athletics with kids. It's so great. Ricky, awesome game of wiffle ball gets started. So, so good. Esther smiles, comes over. She's got Al in her arms, gives her a kiss. Comes over to talk to Kingston over by the barbecue. Just catches you up on the society, how everything's going. They've improved the umbral engine so much. They've learned so much more. Now there's regular expeditions going out into the Sixth Borough just to give help to the Sixth Borough and help explore it and create more open connection between both sides of the waking and the dreaming. And speaking of umbral arcana, bunch of your magical friends show up. Willy shows up with Rabbi Mike to come hang out. Willy,"
"Willy: Oh, it's so good. Look at this. Look at this young kid. How about this?"
"Brennan: And you see Langston looks up and sees Willy. And for a moment sees past the umbral arcana, but then goes back to seeing Willy."
"Lou: Oh, so Langston sees Willy as like a person?"
"Brennan: Langston sees Willy as a person. Yes, absolutely. You are joined by so"
"many of your friends here including friends from this season. Em the angel of the water because the fountain shows up. Mentioning,"
Em: I can't believe I missed that whole deal a couple of years ago. That was crazy.
"Kingston: It's all good, Em. A lot of it didn't take place in Central Park. So we've never really had-"
"Em: I know. For me it's all about the fountain kind of. You know, it's gotta be about the fountain for me to kind of pay attention."
Brennan: And I think finally rolling up are Sofie-
"Emily: Yeah, I was gonna say realistically coming from Staten Island, we show up last."
(everyone laughs)
"Yeah, so I think we show up with like a bunch of boxes from Spaghetti's Bakery."
(everyone laughs)
"Sofia: Make some room on the table, make some room."
"Kingston: Yeah, yeah. I mean, you bring the cannolis? You know, I love a cannoli."
"Sofia: Honestly, every box is full of cannolis. Yeah, so."
"Emily: And then I think me and Dale have a little daughter with us whose name is Catherine, but we call her Cat. And I think Sofia's been obviously working with Kugrash's (laughs) nasty little order to help protect the little critters that no one cares about. I think she's also taken up his trap neuter release program. And I think that she's, like, at least trying to work on the idea that part of Pete's cafe area could be a cat cafe where we could get some cats adopted."
"Ally: I'm like,"
"Pete: Yeah, maybe."
"Ally: And I'm realizing you smell just a little bit, but I would never tell you."
Emily: Please say that is not canon.
(everyone laughs)
"Look, I fucking took this off Ricky's shoulders. Do not make me smell."
Ricky: I would love to still help by the way.
"Ally: I'm like,"
Pete:so how's flute neuter release going?
(everyone laughs)
"Sofia: Yeah, I took over Kug's flute that lures all the cats."
(everyone laughs)
"Brennan: Incredible. You guys arrive. You see Dale rolls up as well here. You see La Gran Gata moves around Cat. La Gran Gata loves Cat with all her heart, is protecting your daughter at every step. You look up and see all your friends gathered here. More and more people, huge, huge party. Beautiful summer day. Green trees swaying in the park, light coming in. Good food, friends from every place in the city. JJ is recording the whole thing. After the fight at the Bleecker Street, at the Central Park North"
"hoard, moving around."
"JJ: Hey, so this is recording. It's mid July. We're having a great time here at the park."
"Smiling and laughing. You see, fuck it. Stephen Sondheim shows up."
Lou: Yeah!
"Brennan: Someone's like, ""Is that Stephen Sondheim?"""
Zac: He's just crushing wiffle ball.
Brennan: Stephen Sondheim-
Emily: Can I arm wrestle Stephen Sondheim?
(everyone laughs)
Brennan: He grabs it and fully flips you over in the air. And then he walks up-
"Emily: Oh, to be flipped by Stephen Sondheim."
"Brennan: Stephen Sondheim walks up to home plate at the wiffle ball game. And you see, he calls, he points to a skyscraper and says,"
Stephen Sondheim: Calling it.
Ricky: No way.
(everyone laughs)
Brennan: Wiffle balls sails out.
Ally: He's stealing bases. The kids are crying.
(everyone laughs)
Murph: Cody's running back to try to catch what is clearly a very distant home run.
"Cody: Oh, I gotta get it! Fuck, fuck, fuck."
"Brennan: Kingston, you feel a little sort of like something whispering in the back of your head asking you to use a sixth level spell slot to cast summon celestial spirit."
Lou: I use a six level spell slot to cast summon celestial spirit.
"Brennan: So that Alejandro and Maria can show up to enjoy a barbecue here in the city together. Alejandro eats his fill, talks with Esther about magic. You see as he's talking to Esther, and actually talking to Esther about something on JJ's screen. Ricky, you see Al, who's only two years old, looks at and sounds out an entire sentence from a spell book that should be protected by the umbral arcana. Just looks at it. And sounds out the words. Esther looks over at you holding Al in her arms and says,"
Esther: Did she just read that?
"Ricky: Yeah, she can read."
(everyone laughs)
"Esther: Yeah, that is separately impressive, Ricky. But this is protected by-"
"Ricky: She's two, she can read."
(everyone laughs)
"And then the magic stuff is awesome. But pretty soon, I'm not gonna be able to teach her anything."
(everyone laughs)
That's already more. That's already more.
"Brennan: You see she kisses you. She says,"
"Esther: No, no, no, no. This is very special."
"Brennan: Dale marvels at this as well. Dale current First Fist of the Order of the Concrete Fist, Protector of the Monastery of the Midnight Sun. Although having instituted some pretty profound changes in the order's relationship to the dreaming world, Dale has a city job. He's on a city budget council to reappropriate the city's funds for public services like transportation, housing, and all this kind of shit to make Gladiator a distant fucking memory."
(Ally cheers)
"You see there is a moment of Nick and Jessica, as these much older now teenagers, Jessica is doing some small magic tricks for a little trio of toddlers, for Langston, Cat, and Al who all look up. And there's a moment where they all watch and gasp as Jessica is just doing magic tricks. And you see a moment of Langston filling with primal magic of stories and myth and legend. You see a little bit of celestial radiance around Cat, and a little bit of arcane insight from Al. And then they run off to go get snacks and popsicles and run carefree through the meadow as Nick and Jess both kind of look at each other and raise their eyebrows. Alejandro and Maria as the evening goes are gonna go grab dinner while the spell is still active, go see Alejandro's granddaughters who he wants to go see. And a beautiful day is had in the park as the sun lowers in the sky. Is there any last thing that anyone here wants to say as these characters enjoy this perfect golden day together?"
"Lou: I think Kingston asks to take a picture of everybody. Like, asks everyone. Just like real dad energy."
"Kingston: Okay, everybody closer! Come on, closer!"
Sofia: Can you get one on my tablet?
(everyone laughs)
Cody: Is it okay if the moped is in the picture? Can I drive it on the grass?
"Siobhan: And I hold Misiek,"
Iga: Like this is what you want to see
"Kingston: Yes! Iga, Misiek's blocking you."
"Cody: Ricky, can you help me move the moped?"
"Iga: Stop hiding your face. You're beautiful, you're beautiful."
Sofia: Your hair is everywhere.
"Kingston: Okay, yeah, great. Okay, everybody look at the tablet. I'm gonna do the tablet one first. All right, three, two-"
"Iga: Kingston, put it on timer! You need to be in here!"
Ricky: You know what? I can run out and do a selfie.
"Sofia: Hold on, let me tease Cat's hair."
(everyone laughs)
"Kingston: You got the arms for it, right."
"Brennan: We get one Ricky selfie of everybody, click, in the frame. Timer goes off and a beautiful snapshot of all these New Yorkers happy and together in the Unsleeping City is where we're gonna end our season. This has been ""The Unsleeping City Season Two."" Tons of love from everyone here at Dimension 20 to everyone at home. Thank you so much for watching. See you next time!"
Ally: Yeah!
