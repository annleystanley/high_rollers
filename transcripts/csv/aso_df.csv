"Brennan: Hello one and all, and welcome to a new thrilling season of Dimension 20. I am your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan, with me, as always in the dome, are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes."
"Brennan: That's what I'm talking about, baby."
"Lou: There it is, there's the juice."
Brennan: There's the juice. There's what we love.
Ally: Finally the juice.
"Brennan: Listen, me and the intrepid heroes we want to say hi, we want to shout out back in the dome. First of all, to all of you, we are, of course, being incredibly safe and COVID compliant. Shout out to face shields and masks and all of our crew being kept safe. Thank you, Ash and the rest"
"of the production department for keeping us all safe. One may notice a couple of things different in this season. I want to shout out a couple other people, because it's a new season in a brand, brand new setting. And you know, we were looking, we were looking all over the world for new settings to play in. I was like, we gotta find a Sci-Fi setting with the humor and grit"
"and wit, and wonder to take us and the intrepid heroes to the stars. So reached out to noted author, Elaine Lee to use her setting of ""Starstruck"". Elaine Lee the noted author of ""Starstruck"", ""Vamps"", ""BrainBanx"", many comics, also the author of me,"
Zac: Wow.
"Brennan: -her son, Brennan Lee Mulligan. Mom, thanks for the galaxy. We will handle it with love and care."
"Ally: We love you, Elaine! I can't wait to meet you one day."
(laughs)
"Ally: And talk about astrology, baby."
(laughs)
Brennan: There you go. My mom famously sent Ally my birth chart and--
"Ally: Yep, got all the juicy deets."
(laughs)
Emily: What are his weaknesses?
"Ally: Oh, I can tell you. I'll write it down."
"Brennan: That's the main thing astrology does, is list your weaknesses vulnerabilities to fire and poison."
(laughs)
"Brennan: Yes, we will be playing in the ""Starstruck"" universe, the graphic novel series from writer, Elaine Lee, and artist, Michael Kaluta. Shout out to Mike Kaluta, my godfather. And a world of hot suns, hot guns. We enter (trills) AnarchEra 220 and they'll\- they'll do this. I'm doing with my mouth, but they'll probably add a noise here too. AnarchEra 220 Hecatoncheires Asteroid Cluster, just outside the Phoebus system, spinning asteroids floating in space as distance stars glitter on the face of mother void (vocalized explosions) yellow gleaming hyon beams (vocalized lasers) blast across the space as the Red Hot, a massive Amercadian modified retrofitted smuggler freighter races through the asteroid belt as hyon beams from pursuing Roid Removers. (vocalized laser shots) You guys see a bunch of clampers zooming in past you. Hyon beams skating across the shields of your ship. Gang… roll initiative."
(Cast exclaims and laughs)
Lou: [to the audience] You don't even know who I am.
Emily: What?
"Brennan: It's a new season. We're back in the dome, no punches pulled."
"Siobhan: I rolled a nat one, baby!"
"Murph: Oh, I also rolled a nat one, no."
Lou: One more nat one.
(screeches)
Ally: You get tickled.
(laughs)
Lou: Third nat one.
"Murph: No, no."
Emily: Can I roll with disadvantage to try and get a nat one?
"Brennan: Yeah, roll with disadvantage, you're gonna hit a nat one."
"Murph: Please don't, please don't."
"Emily: Oh, I rolled better."
(laughs)
"Lou: Left out, dude, left out. All the cool kids are rolling nat ones these days."
"Brennan: What did we get here, Zac?"
"Zac: I got a 19, I don't know what the fuck's wrong with everyone else."
"Brennan: Incredible. What did we get here, Ally?"
Ally: Three.
Brennan: A three amazing.
"Zac: Are you serious, three nat ones and a three?"
Lou: These were given to me by Rick Perry.
"Siobhan: Yeah, Rick Perry--"
Emily: Also rolled the dice given by Rick Perry.
"Emily: My Rick Perry gave me a dirty 20, with advantage a dirty 21, but I got disadvantage so just a dirty 20."
"Brennan: Just a dirty 20, incredible."
"Ally: Wow, here we go."
"Brennan: That's right, for the first time in Dimension 20 history, we will be leaping straight into combat. It's a tough galaxy out there, but somebody's got to live in it. It might as well be you. Gang, we meet the crew of the Red Hot when things are looking pretty bad. This retrofitted, old, discontinued Amercadian Space Brigade, mess freighter is crewed by the following individuals. We're going to start, of course, on the bridge. Where, of course, only two of our crew members are currently active. Zac and Siobhan could you please introduce your characters and describe them?"
"Zac: I am Norman ""The Skipper"" Takamori and I am the captain of this vessel and I am surrounded by morons."
(laughs)
"Norman: Seriously, where is everybody? We're being chased by a bunch of little freaks?"
(laughs)
"Brennan: That's right, as the captain is so quick to notice you are being pursued by a veritable armada of Armstrong Roid Removers. When it's time for you to remove a pesky asteroid trust Armstrong, the number one name in asteroid removal. Though, these ones seem to have been outfitted with Space Saber hyon beams that are currently blasting your shields away. I should mention you are not currently at 88 shield points. Could you mark yourself down at a humble 18 shield points remaining."
"Emily: 18, we're down to 18?"
Brennan: You're down to
Siobhan: Great.
"Emily: Brennan, bad baby."
Ally: There are more than 18 people following us.
"Brennan: Let's hope that they only do one point of shield damage each. So we see Captain Norman ""The Skipper"" Takamori, what does he look like?"
Zac: He is like half shaved. He has like a little towel around his neck. He had his like two minutes of peace and quiet where he didn't have to hear these morons jabbering away at his ears. And then of course we're getting attacked by a fuckin' armada of drones coming in after us shooting their hyon beams. I'm in hell.
(laughs)
"Brennan: Incredible, looking back over the hassled captain's shoulder we see in the center of the bridge an enormous glass sphere of water. And within that water, we see the ships comms officer, Riva. Siobhan, could you introduce your character to us?"
"Siobhan: Hello, I'm Riva the comms officer slash unpaid intern. Riva's obviously my human name. My actual Aguatunisian name is, and then you get an image of being deep underwater and finding a current that leads you swiftly and perfectly to where you need to get to. So that's my real name, but that's a bit complicated for most non-psychic life forms. So Riva's good for me, I'm just here having a good time. I'm out on my gallivant. That's a thing that we Aguatunisians do. We go out and we live out in the world before returning back to our home water planet."
"Riva: Oh, this is so fun, isn't it? Oh, it's so fun."
"Brennan: Riva, from your central water ball on the bridge, you see (vocalized ping) a hailing signal from a nearby class YNV Anolo Interceptor incoming from a ship designation The Lady Pike."
"Riva: Hello, hi, how's it going?"
"Brennan: You activate the screen and coming up in front of you and the captain, you see a dull red bridge of a pursuing ship, this larger, Anolo Interceptor. You see there is a very old, like deep wrinkles, of almost she's like maybe like 80 years old. She's got sunglasses on and a kind of like some kind of fangs around the outset cowboy hat low as she's at the command bridge. You hear,"
"Jan de la Vega: Oh hey in there, this is Captain Jan de la Vega of The Lady Pike. We're coming in hot on your tail, friend-o. Noticed you lifted some Borinyum krystal off the cosmic veil couple of banlons back. So here's the deal, amigo. You hand over the krystal and we don't bust your ass back and forth to the Byzon Galaxy. How does that fit, partner?"
Riva: Okay. We'll be right there. We'll hand it right over to you.
"Norman: Absolutely not. We're not handing over the krystals, goddammit! Listen to me. Space is pretty big and there are very small borders between things that are unclear to a lot of people. I don't think we found that where you say we found it. So we're going to take this krystal and we're going to get out of here."
"Riva: Oh, he says we're taking the krystal and we're going to get out of here."
Norman: She can hear me.
"Riva: Oh, right."
(laughs)
(vocalizes lazers)
"Jan de la Vega: Well, I see about 20 Roid Removers. These clampers would love to get in under those shields and buzzsaw away. So if you want to try to run, hoss, be my guest, but we're getting them krystals one way or another. Ain't that right, Needles?"
"Brennan: One other com screen opens and you see a Kranchian gunner. Who's this little lizard guy go,"
"Needles: (laughs) That's right boss, let's open fire."
Norman: Lizard people shooting at me now.
(laughs)
"Brennan: Norm, today's a pretty bad day. And we move back through time to better days, golden fields of wheat swaying in Kansas on Amercadia. Ranks and ranks of Amercadian cadets saluting as you, in full dress uniform, approach the dais. Beckoning you up is general Analinda Weatherall of the Amercadian Space Brigade. Norm, on this day, as you're being decorated, what's going through your head this\- this many years in the past?"
"Zac: I think Norm is looking around at just truly the most perfect, beautiful thing he can imagine, a full military."
(laughs)
"Zac: Look at it. Everyone's in uniform. Everyone is uniform. Everyone is puffing their chests out, being the brave heroes that they should be and Norm is doing everything in his power to live up to the name and puff his chest out just as hard."
"Analinda Weatherall: Cadet Norman Takamori, please approach the dais."
(laughs)
Murph: So many corners.
(laughs)
"Brennan: As you approach the dais,"
"Analinda Weatherall: For outstanding service and gallantry in the face of overwhelming odds, for your position as Ace Tiger pilot of your squadron, we award you the Brass Tiger."
"Brennan: And you see pins a medal to your chest (vocalizes gunfire) guns fire off, (cheers) everyone applauds as you approach the dais."
Crowd: ♪ And through the course of history ♪
♪ There was but one society ♪
♪ That stood for might and liberty♪
Brennan: Hat removed.
"Crowd: ♪ The old green, red, and blue ♪"
♪ Amercadia ♪
"Brennan: And you see the banner waving over Kansas: Amercadia, the Amercadian Space Brigade. Good till the last drops."
Zac: Just a little bit of a tear.
"Brennan: We've cut a couple of years later, you're in a dull brown office with sort of the shades drawn, wispy kind of desert of New Texas looking out behind you."
"Officer: I'm sorry, we're not going to put the squadron under your command."
"Norman: But I, sorry. Sorry, sir. I am. What, what else is there anything else to do? Are there any other options?"
"Officer: Well, you know, we discontinued."
"Norman: The Space Brigade is kind of the best thing there is, right? It's the most, the thing that I am most proud of and it feels a little like, well, I, I kind of don't understand what you're telling me right now."
"Officer: Well, we're saying that this is where it ends, Norman. We're saying this is where it ends."
"Brennan: You see that the officer here just looks and says,"
Officer: here's the best we can do. We can bust you down to corporal and have you ride a desk or you're discharged with honors. You take half pay on your pension. It's not a bad deal.
"Norman: I mean, I guess I could get out there, get that half pension and try to find my own way."
"Brennan: You see the officer shrugs and goes,"
"Officer: Now you could cash out half your pension, get yourself a ship if you want to still be a pilot, obviously, you know, you're foregoing a lot of future money."
"Brennan: As the officer begins to say this you look out and see an old mess freighter. It's been discontinued, this line. They don't make this anymore. And you see it's going to go to surplus sale, but you see a rusty old hot dog shaped ship out there on the launch pad, outside the medical offices."
"Officer: I mean, I don't recommend cashing out your pension, you know, but because you'd be cashing it out at half pay. So the life of the pension is worth way more."
Norman: I'm cashing the fuck out.
(laughs)
N: I'm going to make my own Space Brigade.
(laughs)
"Officer: The hell, what are you saying, Norman?"
Norman: I'm saying there's gotta be people out there who can crew up a ship like that and be just as good.
Brennan: We cut to the present moment.
(laughs)
Zac: I can't find any help.
(laughs)
"Brennan: Zac, you are first to act in combat."
"Zac: I am going to use evasive maneuvers, which is before my initiative, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. You can do this."
"Zac: And roll a D6 and move that multiplied by 50 away from these people behind us, right?"
"Brennan: Hell yeah, we got to give a huge shout out here first of all, to TaleSpire, Rick Perry, Katie, Nick. and of course our builders Hanan and Jonny over at TaleSpire, for the incredible work building out this Sci-Fi setting. Thanks for taking us to the world of ""Starstruck"". Also to our friends at Hero Forge and Fox for hooking up all these rad minis. And also, as you may notice, we're playing with some wild rules. We'll be playing with SW5E. Shout out to Todd and Tegan, Todd Moonbounce and Tegan Jenkins over at SW5E for hooking us up. Check out Dungeon Jedi Masters for the scoop on how to play this wild system that we're playing here."
Lou: That person's last name Moonbounce?
Brennan: Todd Moonbounce and Teagan Jenkins.
Lou: The most perfect last name I ever heard.
(laughs)
Brennan: Bada boom. Go ahead and roll the dice and we'll see how many feet you move.
"Norman: Okay, someone's got to get us out of here and it certainly won't be my crew."
"Zac: He is gonna roll the D6, five, so five times 50. So I go 250 feet straight away. And that is prior to my turn, I believe."
"Brennan: Yes, it's when you roll initiative."
"Zac: Okay and I think, I just want to make an investigation check on what, it feels like we got to get the fuck out of here versus we're fighting these."
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me your perception, yeah."
"Zac: Okay, my ship's perception or mine?"
Brennan: You could use yours with disadvantage or you can use the ship's. And the ship's would be a scan check.
Zac: 18.
"Brennan: 18? You are overwhelmed with these Armstrongs here, with these clampers and buzzers from the Roid Removers. And you also are looking back, that interceptor behind you is definitely modded out. You can see them arming up a tractor beam on the front of that interceptor coming after you."
Zac: Okay. I'm in hell.
(laughs)
Zac: Yeah. 250 feet away. I think I'm just going to use the rest of my action to fly straight ahead and use a bonus action dash away.
Brennan: Incredible.
Zac: We're going as far forward as we can.
Brennan: Four of these Roid Removers are going to take their reaction at this point.
"Zac: Oh, god damn it."
"Brennan: They're going to make four attacks on the ship. They make this as part of a charge. You see (vocalized whizzing) a couple of these vessels swoop in, three of them, get under your ship's shields and make contact with the hull. They are not using energy weapons. So they bypass shields here. They are using their like construction asteroid stuff to just move in and clamp onto the hull of your ship. Here's where we're at right now. Those are some low rolls. I am going to need three maneuver checks using the Red Hot stats from our pilot, The Skipper."
"Zac: Maneuver checks are dexterity checks, right?"
Brennan: That is correct.
Zac: Which is negative one.
"Murph: Pull up, Skip, pull up."
Siobhan: I would like to give the direct.
Brennan: Absolutely.
Siobhan: Action to give you an advantage on that roll.
"Zac: Thank God, that was a two so it would have been a one. That's 11 so 10."
Brennan: First check succeeds.
(cheers)
Now this next one is rolled straight.
Zac: Okay. 13 which becomes 12.
Brennan: That is a success.
Zac: Natural one.
(groans)
Murph: That'll happen.
Brennan: The ship immediately takes six points of damage to its shields and reduces your speed by 50.
Emily: No.
Lou: I hate to be this guy. Didn't you say it directly impacts our hull?
"Brennan: It does. Sorry, not your shields. Six, hull points of damage. Thank you very much for keeping me honest."
Murph: Lou! Do we have any homework? Do we have any homework?
Siobhan: It's the first day.
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: Amazing.
Emily: Just because I had to ask--
Ally: This is PVP starting now.
Lou: Okay.
Murph: I attack Lou.
(laughs)
"Lou: Me the person, right?"
"Brennan: One of them clamps onto the ship deals a small amount of damage, but reduces your speed by 50 as it clamps on and like it does to asteroids all day, hits its thrusters and starts pulling your ship in the wrong direction. You, it is still your turn. As it uses that reaction, you can go ahead and take whatever movement you're going to take. You said you were going to take a fly action, correct?"
"Zac: Yeah, so I initially moved for the evasive maneuvers and now I'm going to take the fly action and use slippery pilot to, they're grappling? Can I disengage from them?"
"Brennan: If you want to use an action, you can use an action to make another maneuver check and try to shake that clamper off."
Zac: So we only have one clamping onto it.
Brennan: You only have one clamping on right now.
"Zac: Yeah, maybe I'll do that."
Brennan: Give me a maneuver check.
Murph: That negative one.
Zac: Four.
Murph: Oy.
Brennan: Four is not going to do it. You have movement and a bonus action.
Emily: I just want everyone at home to know that Brennan made our fucking ship stats.
(laughs)
"Lou: Yeah, we did not dream this up and we're like, this is what we want."
"Siobhan: If we were creating a ship it would have been so top of the line, you have no idea, absolutely busted ship."
Zac: It would have been a cheeseburger.
Siobhan: Yeah.
(laughs)
"Brennan: Full disclosure at character creation everyone was like we're so excited to play bozos and made the most busted characters I've ever seen. Unreal, okay."
Zac: Okay. So I still have my movement and the bonus action.
Brennan: That's correct.
"Zac: So, I will use full movement just straight ahead."
"Brennan: Amazing, so we're going to move 500 feet forward on this vessel. As you come in proximity to that asteroid, give me one dexterity saving throw."
Emily giggles.
Zac: 16.
"Brennan: You (vocalizes air whooshing) try to shake this guy, zoom out of the way of this asteroid, (vocalizes air whooshing) as it begins to zoom past you."
Norm: Does anyone work on this ship but me?
"Brennan: Riva, you have used your action to direct."
Siobhan: I have used my action.
Brennan: Do you have any bonus actions you would like to use on your turn or no?
Siobhan: I do not have any bonus actions. I have a reaction that I'll use if I need to when I need to.
"Brennan: Amazing, Riva as you sit there, looking at your screaming captain, calling up these helpful things to grant advantage, where you are able, we (vocalizes bubbles percolating) bubbles move around in your watery comms station. And we return to Aguatunisia many years ago. You look before you and see two of your friends and loved ones. One of them is Cool Water of the Shaded Reef. The other one is Rising Bubbles from a Deep Volcanic Vent Many Fathoms Below Us. Both of those images communicated to your mind. They look at you and say,"
"Cool Water of the Shaded Reef/Rising Bubbles from a Deep Volcanic Vent Many Fathoms Below Us: I'm so excited for your gallivant."""
Riva: I'm so excited for my gallivant.
"Brennan: You see the other one sort of crosses their arms and looks at you and goes,"
"Rising Bubbles from a Deep Volcanic Vent Many Fathoms Below Us/Cool Water of the Shaded Reef: You know, here on Aguatunisia, we share one mind, one heart, and we hide nothing from each other. And there are no secrets kept and no one tries to take advantage of anybody."
Riva: Exactly.
Riva’s Friend: And I assume that's what's going on in the galaxy.
Riva: I don't have any other thoughts about what else it could be.
Riva’s Friend: Amazing.
Riva: We can't be dishonest to each other that's terrible.
Riva’s Friend: It's terrible.
Riva: It's the worst thing that you can do.
(claps)
"Brennan: A couple of years later, you are looking through a pane of glass through some water and you see Sister Mildred of the Cosmic Veil who's a member of the Cloistered Order of the Goddess Uncaring looks up and says,"
"Sister Mildred of the Cosmic Veil: So, you're on your gallivant, right?"
"Riva: Yes, that's right."
"Mildred: Oh, that's amazing. What do you know about Pleasure Putty?"
"Riva: Oh, I don't know anything about Pleasure Putty."
"Mildred: In addition to being a nun, let me talk to you for a second, so I'm actually a part of this business. It's incredible."
"Riva: Oh, okay."
Emily laughs.
Mildred: You're your own boss. You make your own hours.
Riva: No!
Mildred: Yes. It's true.
Riva: Your own hours? What do you make them from?
"Mildred: Wait, oh wait, here's the best part. You don't even have to make the Pleasure Putty. what you do is this. You make a small investment and the company sends you Pleasure Putty."
Riva: No!
Mildred: And then all you do is you recruit people to sell the Pleasure Putty and they make an investment. And basically not only are you your own boss but you're also the boss of these other people who are their own boss.
Riva: That's amazing. It's like a boss within a boss within a boss.
"Mildred: Within a boss, within a boss. It's a quantum state of people being each other's bosses and also themselves."
Riva: That's beautiful.
Mildred: And it forms this perfect structure. The strongest structure in existence is a three dimensional triangle.
Riva: Oh. That is strong.
Mildred: Yeah. Really strong.
Riva: 'Cause all of the corners support each other.
Mildred: All the corners support each other.
Riva: All the corner bosses are supporting the other corner boss.
Mildred: Yeah and the corner bosses all support the boss at the top corner.
"Riva: Right, but the top corner it is also, if you flip it around a bottom, that's beautiful. 'Cause they're all the same, aren't they? They're all bosses."
"Mildred: Yes, and whether it's the top or the bottom, it's where we send our money."
"Brennan: And we cut back. We cut back to you looking down through the water sluice deep, deep down in the ship. You see many, many crates of Pleasure Putty, which you had to pay extra for to get waterproofed that are just waiting for you in your living quarters."
"Siobhan: I'm going to sell some any day. I believe in it because I'm my own boss. (laughs) And I make my own hours and I don't know what I make them from, but I do make them from something."
(laughs)
Emily: From probably the putty.
"Siobhan: Oh, you're so clever."
"Brennan: Incredible, as we look at the ship, we are going to zoom away from the bridge to the dual gunning stations of the vessel. Emily and Murph could you please introduce your characters?"
"Murph: I'm Big Barry Syx, ruggedly handsome, about 38 years old, six foot four, about 235 wearing some kind of like skeletal armor over his huge body and is yelling to the other gunner down the hall."
"Emily: And I am Sundry Sidney, Jane of all trades, the Swiss Army wife. I am a beta version of a discontinued multi-purpose droid. And I'm wearing like a"
little 1950s diner uniform with little roller skates and a little paper hat. But then I also have an assault cannon for an arm and a cybernetic eye.
(laughs)
"Brennan: Both of you are getting communications from the bridge. You can see that one of the Roid Removers is clamped onto the back of the ship. The others are kind of swarming in behind you and you can see way off in the distance, although partially you have partial cover from it through the asteroid field is The Lady Pike. What are both of you calling out to the captain as you hear Norm cursing?"
"Emily: I'm calling out and I'm saying,"
Sidney: what how far away are we from that big green ship? The one that looks like a shark.
Barry Syx: It does kind of look like a shark.
Sidney: It looks like a shark.
Zac: I think it's like 3.200 feet.
"Emily: 3.200 feet, so I couldn't even do it with disadvantage."
"Murph: 3.200 feet you could, that's exactly the range."
Zac: Is that right?
"Emily: If it's 3.200 feet, I could do it."
"Ally: It is, yeah."
"Emily: I think I go to Barry and I'm like,"
"Sidney: Barry, I can take a real big chance and try and get that shot."""
Barry Syx: Take the chance.
Sidney: You think I should take the chance?
"Barry Syx: Take the shot, take the shot Sid, you got it. Androids and steroids, we got this!"
(laughs)
"Sidney: Nuts and bolts, androids and steroids."
"Barry Syx: Nut and bolts, androids and steroids, we got this, take the shot."
"Norman: Get off the chain, my ears are bleeding."
"Barry Syx: We're on the main channel, I'm sorry."
Sidney: I'm sorry captain.
"Barry Syx: Back to gunner channel, back to gunner channel."
"Sidney: Okay, gunner channel."
"Riva: I'm still on gunner channel, I really like you two chatting."
"Sidney: Hey Riva, how are you?"
"Barry Syx: Hey, what's up Riv?"
Riva: Hi.
"Emily: Then I'm going to, I have weapon expert to give me advantage. But so with disadvantage, it'll just be straight."
Brennan: Yeah. So it gives you advantage. This is going to be a straight shot. Correct?
Emily: Okay.
"Barry Syx: Come on Sid, come on."
"Siobhan: Okay, heaven's to motherboard I need this."
Emily: Oh.
(giggles)
Emily: It's an 11.
Brennan: Ricocheting off the asteroids in the mix. The hyon beams of your quad hyon cannon blast off the side of the ship.
(vocalizes cannon fire)
"Sidney: Hey, I may be a droid, but I am programmed with emotions to inhibit some of my more rash behavior. And so right now I feel absolute desolation and defeat. Talk me out of it, Barry, because I'm in a bad place."
"Barry Syx: Sid! You gotta go for it. You got to grab life by the horns, okay. And you did that! Alright? And I love you for it! Alright? Now, I'm going to shoot these fuckers that are real close 'cause that's an easier shot."
"Brennan: As the Red Hot wheels around to bring Barry's gunning station into focus on The Lady Pike Sid, having missed, you enter this deep place of sadness. And we zoom back through time to the corporate boardroom of Handy Andi Android manufacturers. We zoom in on a screen and we see Sundry Sidney, gleaming, smile, rollerskates the candy striper outfit and the gun arm."
Emily smiles and twirls her hair.
"Advert: Presenting new top of the line from the Handy Andi corporation, proud purveyors of fine androids all over the galaxy, Sundry Sidney."
"Sidney: How may I please, pleasure, or protect you?"
"Advert: Look, I'm a mover and shaker of a galactic corporation on the go. I need a majordomo and executive assistant who can keep me safe from all the people who are trying to get my number. And with all of the amenities of the top of the line companion droid, (aside) take that Erotica Ann."
"Sidney: Yeah, fuck Erotica Ann."
(laughs)
Sidney: I've been programmed to say that.
(laughs)
"Advert: Sundry Sidney, the multi-droid for you."
(vocalizes a screen blip)
"Brennan: Little like the holo projection ends and we see a boardroom. A CEO wearing a kind of purple suit, sort of like holds the thing. He just paused the commercial with looks around at the boardroom. You see R & D department, other executives and sort of like, you know, marketing people, ad people, and Sid you are standing there currently having been given the command to stay still. What's your sort of neutral posture as you are frozen?"
Emily: I think I have like the plastered smile of a people pleaser and like a look in my eyes that's desperate for approval. That's like my natural state so that people know that their status is above me.
"Ally: Oh, that doesn't resonate at all."
(laughs)
Brennan: So you see this boardroom filled with executives. There's the CEO of Handy Andi here who has just sort of clicked this button to stop the thing. You see him going and looking.
CEO: So this aired and you understand that Living Doll has already filed suit. “Fuck Erotica Ann?” That made it into the commercial? That made it into the commercial?
Emily and players giggle.
"CEO: Direct slander, fucked us, fucked to death. Why? Does anyone have an answer?"
"Brennan: You see the CEO just kicks the chair over and it looks around and says,"
"CEO: Okay, pull it up, pull up the next slide."""
"Brennan: And you see, it says,"
"CEO: I want to read this to all of you. Product testing, number one, “I found the use of the Sundry Sidney disconcerting. It's multi-functionality left me often at a loss for what to do next. I tried to engage the pleasure droid protocol, but as I became caressed by the assault cannon, I found myself rapidly leaving my state of arousal. The roller skates didn't help either.” Help me out to understand."
"Brennan: You look over, you see that Max Griivarr looks over and points to Dr. Edwina Caster who's sort of an older R and D technician says,"
"Edwina: [nasally voice] We did our best to design the Android to specifications provided. The marketing department contacted us, the idea of a Swiss Army wife."
"Brennan: And you see Max goes,"
"CEO: There's a reason Swiss Army Knives are sold in gift shops. They are trash. When you are buying a tool, you don't want the thing that kind of does it all. Anyone with real McCoy is going to get a Vercadian protector droid, and an Erotica Ann, and a top of the line majordomo. They're going to get an executive assistant droid. Why would someone want to show, we're marketing this to people who want top of the line and we're saying here's a fucking grab bag."
Sidney: Is that a good thing?
CEO: Who left this on?
(laughs)
"Brennan: He turns around and says,"
"CEO: I, fucking thing is still on. Look, the important thing is this, okay."
"Brennan: Looks at the R and D department and says,"
"CEO: I know you did your best, all right. It's got the the assault cannon and the eye. Conceptually, this was wrong from the jump. Can anyone tell me why this was never going to work?"
Brennan: And you see someone looks around and says
Worker: What you said about multi-tools…
"Brennan: And you see that there's another young woman here who raises her hand and says,"
"Assistant: [soft, high voice] Well, there's, isn't there something, sorry, sir. Isn't there something sort of appealing about for all of us, all of us feel like we kind of want to be able to do it all right? And so Sundry Sidney was sort of the idea of you have, there's something sort of aspirational about there's this assistant who's protecting you and is a companion and can provide hospitality."
"Brennan: And you see where the CEO looks and says,"
"CEO: You're fired, you are fired. Get your shit and get out."
"Brennan: You see, he looks around and says,"
"CEO: People want to be everything themselves. We're not selling people. We're selling Androids. What do you want your coffee guy on the corner to do? Do you want him to be an amazing poet? Do you want to know that he has a nice garden at home? You want him to make the best fucking cup of coffee. Melt it down for parts, start again at zero."
"Brennan: Sid, you feel something flick in your krystal consciousness. All seven channels become unlocked and you feel that you are no longer rooted to the spot."
Emily: Can I look at Dr. Edwina Caster with a slightly confused look?
"Brennan: Mm-hmm, she looks at you with a slightly confused look. Are you, are you trying to communicate?"
Emily: I'm like looking for permission.
"Brennan: She looks at you, give me an insight check."
"Emily: Okay, ah 13."
"Brennan: She looks at you with her eyes wide and you see a little twinge of a smile. She goes,"
"Edwina: Oh, everyone in this room, we are in very real danger."
"Emily: Okay. I'm going to cock my machine gun, but then shoot out the"
window and rollerskate out.
"(laughs, buzzing sound)"
Sidney: This database can interface but it can also devastate.
Emily: And then I throw a grenade over my back.
Brennan: You throw a grenade over your back!
(laughs)
(vocalizes pings)
"CEO: Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Brennan: (vocalizes an explosion) Amazing, we cut back to the present moment. Incredible."
Ally: What happened? Did that person who got fired unlock you?
Brennan: We don't know.
"Sidney: Okay Barry, you're right, I've overcome adversity before I can do this. Here's your shot."
"Brennan: Barry. Line it up, baby."
Murph: Put my sunglasses on as Barry gets into the zone. Am I able to shoot the one that's hanging on?
"Brennan: Yes, you were able to target that one, yes."
Murph: I guess I'll take--
Brennan: That one is going to have partial cover 'cause you've only got like a profile on it as it clamps onto the back of the ship.
"Murph: All right, then I'm going to go ahead and take a precision shot, not that any of my shots aren't precision shots. But I do miss sometimes. Okay, okay, please precision shot help that roll, okay. 17 to hit"
"Brennan: 17 hits, baby."
"Murph: Come on, yes. 12 damage."
Brennan: You fully deplete the drone's shield and deal two points of hull damage to it. (vocalizes shots) as you blast through.
"Sidney: Nice one, Barr."
"Barry Syx: Thanks, almost got one."
"Norman: Please, Barry, do your fucking job."
Barry Syx: They have shields.
"Sidney: It's okay, I took a huge swing and missed."
"Norman: Please Barry, do your fucking job."
"Sidney: I'm so sorry, Captain Norman, I really let you down."
"Barry Syx: No, no, no, it’s fine. He's on the gunner channel. This is for us, Skip."
(laughs)
"Norman: Skipper, god damn it."
Sidney: Captain Skip.
"Brennan: Barry, you (vocalizes cannon fire) as you're blasting away at this drone behind you. And we zoom in on the six on your armor and we cut back many years ago. (Gasp) As you emerge, covered with wires and goo, from a big vat and you see five enormous naked, wet men who all look completely identical go,"
Barrys: Barry!
"Barry Syx: What's up, fellas?"
"Barrys: Yeah, dude, come on."
"Barry Syx: Yeah, Barrys, Barrys."
"Barrys: Yeah, come on, dude. Come on, we gotta go this way."
"Barry Syx: Dude, I know what way you're talking about 'cause we're clones."
"Barrys: Yeah, we're clones."
Barry Syx: I know what you're thinking of.
"Brennan: You zoom through and you see that another,"
(gasps) vat opens.
"Barry Syx: Dude, another Barry, what's up."
"Barrys: What's up, dudes?"
"Brennan: A group of enormous muscle bound, wet clones are all born from vats on the same day. And all of you are now in a locker room. You've been toweled off."
(laughs)
"Lou: Lot of snapping, I'm assuming."
(vocalizes a snap)
"01: All right, enough horse play, enough horse play."
"Brennan: You see there's one of you who shares the same general facial structure as you, but is a little bit smaller, a little bit older. And you see he's got a little lab coat on with a little stencil zero one. And he looks around at 11 of you again, one day old, beautiful big boys. (laughs) And he says,"
01: My beloved Barrys. I am you and I am me and I am all of us.
"Barry Syx: That's right, Barry."
"Barrys: That's right, Barry. That's right, Barry. That's right, Barry. (laughs) My name is, as you all know, Barry."
"Barry Syx: Barry, my name's Barry."
"Barrys: It is Barry. Oh, my name's Barry."
"01: Doctor Barry Bohunk, and this the Barry Battalion."
Barry Syx: Yes!
NPCBarry Syx: Yes!
(laughs)
"01: You may well ask why you are all here. And I think, you know why you're here. We are approaching the 200th cycle of Anarch Era following the downfall of the Incorporated Elysian Republic and the demise of the dread dictator in ages past. We see now a free galaxy. And what is the reward for a free galaxy? The encroachment of sectarian, corporate, paramilitary, and religious crypto sectarian, shenaniganry."
Barry Syx: We hate shenanigans.
"Barrys: We hate shenanigans, no more shenanigans."
"01: So in a lawless galaxy, what happens to the little guy when UFTP or John Q Brigade comes marching through, what happens to the little guy?"
"Barry Syx: He gets fucked, sir."
01: He gets fucked. And who unfucks the little guy?
Barry Syx: Barry!
Barrys: Barry
Barry Syx: Barry!
"Brennan: We just smash cut through a bunch of frames of you guys in like huge Space Marine assault armor, like smashing through plate glass windows, grabbing a child from a burning orphanage, smashing out another plate glass window. Just various like A-Team style, like, (nasally narration voice) a small monastery of Teoman Monks is in danger of having their monastery bulldozed by Crown and Scepter and only the Barry Battalion can save them. And you see a glorious series of adventures through the galaxy. Just sort of your memory slows as you remember a fateful day, you wake up in the morning and see Barry One, Dr. Barry walk in say"
"01: Important mission today, Barry Battalion, hope all you Barrys are ready."
"Barry Syx: Barrys are always ready, Barry One."
Barrys: Barrys are always ready. Barrys are always ready.
"Brennan: And you see he says,"
"01: Because you've been working hard. I know it, supersoldier or not."
"Barry Syx: Playing hard too, sir."
01: And that's what today is all about because your mission is Dr. Barry is taking all of you to Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland.
"Barry Syx: Yes, yes, yes!"
"Brennan: Big hugs, the Barrys grabbing each other, lifting each other up."
"Barrys: Yes, we're going, we doing it."
Murph: Everyone starts wrestling.
"Brennan: Everyone's wrestling, big, big wrestling. And you go to Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland, which is a wild theme park in the Griivarr Worlds. You see this enormous, everyone's like big ice cream cones walking through this Fantanimaland together. And suddenly it starts, you're underneath a big awning at the central gazebo of wonder. (vocalizes laser fire) The hyon beams start. And Barry Syx, you come back with an arm full of freezy pops and ice cream cones for everyone and see a floor littered with 10 other Barrys. And you see a door closing and a blood covered Barry Nine looks at you,"
Barry 9: Barry.
"Barry Syx: The fuck did you do, Barry?"
Barry 9: I did what you would do.
(click)
"Brennan: Power cell at empty. He, out of ammo, hits the button (vocalizes an explosion) and blasts off of the surface and Barry Nine vanishes into space."
Barry Syx: Barrys! Barry! Barrys! Barry!
Brennan: Back to present.
(vocalizes cannon fire)
Ally: It's like a Pokemon that can only say it's name.
(laughs)
"Brennan: Amazing, we cut to the reactor core of the ship. And who do we find there?"
"Lou: You find Gunthrial Miggles-Rashbax, aka Gunnie. I'm 4'11"", early thirties, a beautiful black, bald head, and a gorgeous cyborg body. A full cyborg from the neck down, just currently absolutely like busy with, plugging things in, trying to get power wherever it needs to go, checking in on-"
"Gunnie: ""Did you guys say something about a shark?"""
"Sidney: Yeah, I think the ship that's chasing us looks like a shark."
"Gunnie: Okay, it's just a ship that looks like a shark."
Barry Syx: Just a ship that looks like a shark. Not a space shark!
Gunnie: 'Cause if we were dealing with a space shark that would be a big problem.
"Sidney: If I had time to analyze it, I could confirm if it was space shark."
"Norman: It's not a shark, it's a ship with paint on its mouth."
"Riva: So, just to confirm, we are all on the gunner channel right now, we do have a main channel."
"Gunnie: Well, I was talking on the main channel and no one was here. So I was flipping"
"Barry Syx: Oh, are we supposed to, Skip, are we supposed to be on multiple channels?"
Norman: It's Skipper.
"Sidney: Gunnie, I'm glad you're on the gunner channel, and actually it's quite appropriate given your name. I wanted to make sure that I sent down Handy Annie down there with you."
"Gunnie: Yes, Handy Annie is here and being very handy."
"Brennan: We see a sort of cybernetics, a little mechanical hand, Handy Annie is here helping out."
"Emily: It's also an allusion to a long, long, I mean, if this takes place in the future, a long lost podcast."
(laughs)
"Brennan: Hell yes. There you go, exactly. Amazing."
Ally: A what?
"Brennan: So Gunnie you are in the reactor chamber here. You see the vast majority of the ship's power is going all over the ship many to like amid decks. You see one like double J emblem on one, another one's saying ME written over a crossed out escape pods bracket. Gunnie, what are you doing on your turn in combat?"
Lou: I want to check in with the Skipper.
"Gunnie: The Skipper, are we talking on the gunner channel or are we talking on the main channel?"
"Norman: You don't have to call me ""The Skipper."" It's just Skipper, but–"
"Barry Syx: It's just ""Big Skip."""
Gunnie: Okay.
"Sidney: Or ""Captain Skip."""
Norman: What is your question?
Gunnie: Are we fighting or are we running?
Norman: I'm trying to get the fuck out of here.
Gunnie: Great.
Norman: I would appreciate any help at all.
"Riva: Oh, his real name is Norman. Skipper is actually a nickname. If that’s helpful."
"Gunnie: Got it. Alright, Norman The Skipper."
"Lou: Ah, I'm gonna, I'm going to boost the engines. So I'll use the ship's strength."
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a boost engines roll.
Emily: I'm still gonna try to hit that shark next turn.
Norman: And look into some light-
Zac: What is it called?
"Brennan: Oh, faster than light."
"Zac: Yeah, yeah."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Gunnie: Oh, do you want to jump?"
Norman: I want to get the fuck out of here.
Lou: Okay. So do I need to start making Astro Nav checks?
Brennan: You look and see the NavCom hooked up to the tachyon drive. That's your faster than light engine.
Gunnie: It's that bad?
Zac: Skipper looks in the equivalent of a rear view mirror and sees a million little robots and a giant green ship.
"Norman: Yes, it is that bad."
"Gunnie: Well, okay"
Lou: I'd like to begin the process of getting us ready to jump.
Brennan: SQ comes on.
"SQ: Hello, Gunnie. SQ here. Would you like to engage the NavCom's AI?"
"Gunnie: Yes. Please, SQ."
(vocalizes beeps and crackles)
SQ: Would you like to engage the NavComs AI?
"Gunnie: Yes, please."
(vocalizes power down)
Brennan: The NavCom craps out like it always does.
"Lou: Great, so there's no, we're not jumping?"
Brennan: You absolutely can jump but you're gonna have to do everything manually.
"Gunnie: Sick,"
"Lou: Gunnie grabs the nearest piece of paper, a pen and starts charting."
Barry Syx: I hear a scribbling on the gunner channel.
Sidney: Furious as well.
Riva: We do actually have a separate scribbling channel if you want to go over to that one.
"Gunnie: Okay great, I'm going to flip to scribble. Oh, I'm doing this by hand. Give me a second."
Sidney: Handy Annie is wearing a calculator watch.
"Gunnie: Oh, good to know. Handy, 3.14172 times 2.71."
"Ally: Oh, that’s gotta be in the art."
"Brennan: So, you start calling out equations, 3.12. We see Gunnie here calling out equations 'cause the ship's computer is so outdated that it's easier for you to do it yourself."
SQ: 3.1 dot dot dot dot.
"Brennan: We skip back to a non-cyborg, a fully organic non-mechanical Gunthrie Miggles-Rashbax writing equations out longhand with chalk on a blackboard at the bottom of a very well appointed university auditorium. You are a TA here in this room. You see professor Dora Valentine seated at a desk gazing at you admiringly. What do you thinks going on as Gunnie sort of clocks into these Astro navigation equations?"
"Lou: I think Gunnie's bored. I mean, it's like, I think this is like pretty rote for him. This is doing what I do most days. I don't know, nothing about this is particularly challenging or hard."
"Brennan: Professor Valentine looks up and speaks to the class and says,"
"Valentine: what Mr. Miggles-Rashbax's showing all of you is, of course, the equation used most commonly in the conversion of plutonium energy into a ship's tachyon drive, which facilitates faster than light travel. But of course, any fan of pop music would be able to tell you all about (laughs) tachyons."
"Brennan: And you see this in a very polite little bit of laughter at this like professor joke. You see, she goes """
"Valentine: well, Mr. Miggles-Rashbax thank you so much for your time. Class next week we will, of course, be completing our assignments on the folding of space time, quantum entanglement, and as it pertains specifically to space travel. (more quietly) Gunthrie, can I speak to you for a moment?"
"Gunnie: Yeah, of course."
"Brennan: You see the class begins to let out and she says,"
"Valentine: I would be remiss if I did not say first and foremost, that what you did was extraordinary, which is incredible for someone as emotionally checked out as I know you are."
"Gunnie: I'm not, no, it's not. It's I'm not checked out. I just, you know, it's getting old this whole school thing. I don't know. You ever thought about getting out of here?"
Valentine: Getting to where? Teach at another university?
"Gunnie: No, no, no, no like I'm writing the equation for conversions in a tachyon drive. Have you ever actually flown in a ship with a tachyon drive?"
"Valentine: Well, sure. They're pretty common on a lot of ships, I think. I don't know for certain. Well no, the ferry I take to work that doesn't have a tachyon–"
"Gunnie: No, no, not on. Out there, in space."
"Valentine: I've never wondered, but I know this, real mathematics, mathematics that matters always comes from the heart."
Gunthrie nods.
"There is no numerology, study of meaning quantitative value asset that is greater than the feeling of doing what you are passionate about and I believe that fully and truly. I think if you feel a calling to something, that's something you have to seriously meditate on."
Gunnie: I'm going to do it.
"Brennan: Those words echo in your ear as you look through a massive plate glass wall bay window, overlooking the shimmering white sands of the desert planet of Mirage. And there's a fancy little soiree happening here. You come from an extremely well-to-do family. Your father, Professor Erwin Rashbax, is published bestseller many times over and your other father, Dr. Jeffrey Miggles works here at the university as well. And he's a full research professor, he doesn't even have to teach classes anymore. He's just here working in theoretical physics and xenobiology, like a true savant in two different, extremely wildly disparate fields of science. You see Jeffrey looking out, sort of holding court and saying like,"
"Jeffrey: And of course, he's sort of fast tracked. We think he's going to probably lock down PhD number three any day now. Gunthrie, please, please come here and meet some people."
"Gunnie: Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course."
"Brennan: You see, he says,"
"Jeffrey: This is my son, Gunthrie, we should say academic superstar."""
Gunnie: For now.
Jeffrey: What do you mean for now? For always.
"Gunnie: Well, not forever, but maybe something, maybe a break, like, you know, in a couple like, you know, soon and then maybe coming back."
"Jeffrey: Oh, sabbatical. Yes, well of course he’s not going to be in academia forever. He is also going to write a book one day."
"Gunnie: Okay, well, I mean, you know, I might take a gap year, do some travel. Maybe try other things."
"Jeffrey: Yes exactly, a gap year for some sort of journey of some sort."
"Gunnie: I'm going to space, dad."
Jeffrey: You're not going to space.
Gunnie: I am.
Jeffrey: You are not going to space.
Gunnie: I'm going to space.
"Brennan: We cut to you in a dingy office and you see a guy who literally he's like bristle brush mustache, weird, dirty hat. He's saying,"
"Dan Scrap: (blearily) Now, you wanna go to space?"""
Gunnie: Yeah. You need to see my resume?
Dan Scrap: Nope.
"Gunnie: Okay. I've got, I've got two degrees."
"Dan Scrap: Yeah, what we need is a navigator."
"Gunnie: I can do that, easy."
"Dan Scrap: Listen, I'm sure you heard of me. It's Captain Dan Scrap of the ""Bad Call"". Okay. (laughs) Now, I'm not going to lie to you. We've had navigators before. You don't, you're not on Kublacaine right?"
Gunnie: What?
Dan Scrap: You're not. Well you gotta piss in a cup if you want to work on the ship.
"Gunnie: I'm not on Kublacaine, no."
Dan Scrap: You sure you don't have any warrant?
Gunnie: What? Oh?
"Dan Scrap: Any warrant, any warrant out?"
"Gunnie: No, no. I, once I did get a, a good telling to once, but no, nothing, nothing serious. We were swimming where we shouldn't have been."
(laughs)
"Dan Scrap: So you know, you've never been arrested?"
"Gunnie: Never not one, not once in my life."
"Dan Scrap: What the hell, kid? What the hell? Well, we got ourselves a real greenhorn here. So, let me ask you a question here. Let's say you wanted to hyper jump drive from tachyon drive to, (snores) sorry. I'm a little drunk."
Gunnie: Okay. That's space.
"Dan Scrap: That's space, you want to get a taste of space, huh? Sign here."
Gunnie: Okay.
"Brennan: And he says,"
"Dan Scrap: oh, we offer, by the way, we offer, the Spacer Guild has an insurance. They, but they take a percentage of whatever you make on the, on the trips. So they're going to carve out probably 10% of your haul. Better you do a flat rate after the trip to pass clearance. And then, they don't get a percentage because if you strike it big on a haul like this, then you don't want the insurance company to come in and carve out. So what we recommend you do is fly uninsured"
Gunnie: Okay.
Dan Scrap: and then you come in afterwards and you pay the flat rate after the trip.
"Gunnie: Great. So knowing, that's what- spacers don't do insurance? We're not doing that? My dads would probably be, they like are always, they always like anytime we fly, it's like they get insurance, they get insurance on the insurance. Well we, but spacers we're like, nah?"
"Dan Scrap: Well, it's up to you, right? You're the egg head kid, so why don't you run the math for me. It's a one in a million that something bad happens. And it's a 100% chance that the insurance company takes 10% of your haul."
"Gunnie: I mean, well, I'm a true spacer. So no thank you insurance."
(vocalizes explosion)
Brennan: Your intestines are floating in space.
Lou cry-laughs
Ally: [Ally] Whoa.
(yells)
"Brennan: Your ship is in tatters. You see Dan Scrap is completely uninjured looking out and he says,"
"Dan Scrap: oh, I forgot to mention you want to get a zero grav suit."
"Brennan: You see that he puts a bowl over your head, which is giving you oxygen. But open void is freezing your digits and pulling at your skin. You see your intestines just floating into space and hardening into ice as the wet of your own blood freezes in the cold of space. You see a little ambulance craft and there's (exhales) a person floats up to you and holds something out in front of you. You see a space paramedic floats up with a data screen in front of you and you hear,"
Paramedic: Are you insured?
Gunnie: No.
"Paramedic: Okay, we need you to sign here and here,"
Gunnie: How?
Paramedic: There is out-of-pocket costs. Oh you can’t— Can you move your arm?
Gunnie: No.
Paramedic: Use your tongue.
(laughs)
Lou: Gunthrie has a very elaborate signature.
(groans)
Brennan: You are in full traction in a hospital in a hospital room. And you are sitting in the hospital room with Captain Dan Scrap and also--
"Gunnie: It's really nice of you to come, Dan."
"Dan Scrap: You know, I feel bad about everything that happened."
Brennan: There's a representive from Acme-Ashmun here saying
"Representative: The cybernetic organ transplant, the blood processors, kidney replacement, limb replacement, leg replacement and keeping the original organic feet, but giving the feet, the cybernetic casing to interface them with the completely cybernetic legs, the replacement for your eye, all of that is going to come in at a total of 600,000 galactic credits."
"Guthrie squeezes his eyes shut, shakes his head."
"Gunnie: Dan, we're going to go on a lot of missions and we'll make a lotta...?"
"Dan Scrap: Well, I hate to tell you this, but I actually have to let you go."
Gunnie: What?
"Dan Scrap: If we keep you on the crew, then we got to pay worker's comp."
"Gunnie: Yeah, yeah that makes sense."
"Dan Scrap: I also, if we let the ship's insurance cover it, I get two points on my license and I can't get any more points on my license."
"Gunnie: No, I get that. I get that."
"Dan Scrap: But, you're a good egg, you're a good egg."
Laughs.
"Gunnie: Thanks, Dan."
"Dan Scrap: Welcome to the spacin' life, buddy."
Brennan: We cut back to the present moment.
Gunnie: 27.144.
"Brennan: As you breathe harder, the credit starts going up. You are charged per breath because of your synthetic lungs. And as you breathe faster and faster."
(vocalizes beeps)
"Gunnie: Deeper breathes, deeper not shallow, deeper. (inhales and exhales slowly) 2 point 14161 (deep breath) 617434117… (deep breath)"
"Brennan: A little message comes up in the reactor core. A new, more dangerous repayment organization has bought one of your medical loans due to your defunct or lapsed payments on this account. But you continue charging forward. Let's go ahead and make these Astro navigation checks and also a boost for the engines. Let's do the engine boost first."
Lou: The engine boost first. Great. That's going to be the space. That's the ship's.
Brennan: Plus three on the Red Hot for boost.
Lou: That's an eight plus three equals 11. That will not do it.
"Brennan: Boost is plus three for the skills for the Red Hot, correct?"
Lou: Yes. But I got an eight.
Brennan: You are one shy of boosting engines. You start to pull them off.
(vocalizes beeps)
"Gunnie: Come on, come on. Yeah."
"Message: Dear Mr. Miggles-Rashbax, your loans have been in repayment, lapsed credit, your monthly minimum 16,500 credits."
"Brennan: Your pristine cyborg body, which is top of the line, Acme-Ashmun, the best they make, and which costs you a fortune, you rent your ability to live from the company you bought this from. Let's make those Astro Navigation checks to get you out of hot water."
Lou: Great. How many can I make?
"Brennan: You are going to make one— because, the ship's computer, you can use the ship's computer, but it's quite bad."
Lou: No.
"Brennan: We're going to go pen and paper. You're making this at disadvantage canceled with Handy Annie, this is a straight"
Emily: I got you.
"Brennan: Mechanics kit check, so it's proficiency."
Lou: Plus seven.
Brennan: Plus seven to the roll?
Lou: That's a 10.
Brennan: Your calculations are adequate resulting in one completed equation. It requires 10 completed equations to jump to faster than light travel.
Ally: Oh.
"Siobhan: All right, all right."
(vocalizes beeps)
"Brennan: These three Roid Removers are going to double move to get in striking distance of the Red Hot. The one who's already got you clamped is going to make another attack, that's a natural 20. That is a bad roll for it to have rolled double damage on."
"Emily: Oh right, I'm on ship HP."
"Brennan: 12, 22, 25 points of hull damage, bypassing shields. Up above Captain Takamori, you see, (whirr) a buzzsaw cleave through the outer hull. You hear airlocks go off. You see popping his head in, in a little sweater vest is Raymond Zam, who is the office manager for the Jib-Job coworking space that you rent out in the lower decks of the Red Hot, which is probably one of your best monetary sources."
"Raymond: Hi, ah, Skipper, sorry, pal. We're having a graphic design quarterly downstairs and we noticed the ship, so there's like a loud noise."
"Norman: There's a loud noise, yeah. We're being attacked right now."
Raymond: Could we just push that back by 90 minutes?
"Norman: (silently mouths, enraged, shakes his head, then sarcastically says) I'll see what I can do."
"Raymond: Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Listen, it's just we only have, we only have these quarterly, so it's just once every three nargons, and it's kind of a lot of work."
"Norman: Right, right."
"Raymond: Yeah. Gosh, thank you so much. I appreciate it."
Brennan: You see Raymond heads off.
Zac: He just like drop kicks a chair as soon as he's gone.
(laughs)
Riva: That wasn't truthful at all what you just said to him. And he just believed it.
"Norman: Listen, just go swim in circles or whatever you do."
Riva: Okay.
(laughs)
"Brennan: This squadron over here are all going to take They're gonna move and move again, 800. These five over here are going to move just 400 and then open fire with lasers on the ship."
Zac: Are we dead?
(laughs)
"Emily: Yeah, I'm going to say we're actually down to 27 hit points on the ship."
Ally: Out of how many?
Lou: On the hull?
Murph: We still have a shield.
"Emily: 27 hull points and 18 shield points. So, let's make 'em, let's stretch them as far as we can."
(dice rattle)
"Brennan: Oh my God, only one hits."
Ally: Whew.
Murph: Thank god.
"Brennan: Astounding, (laughs)."
(groans)
Siobhan: This game is stressful. I’d forgotten
(laughs)
Brennan: Shields take 11 points of damage from one of the lasers.
"Emily: All right team, down to… down to"
Murph: 7
Emily: Seven hit points on our shields.
Brennan: And The Lady Pike is going to move.
Ally: She's too far away. I think she's just like watching TV.
"Lou: Yeah, they're probably it's just a bad signal on the antenna for the TV."
"Ally: Yeah, they're just moving for better signal."
Siobhan: Somebody— send somebody out to move the rabbit ears around.
Lou: Exactly.
"Ally: She's watching like a game show, like celebrities dip themselves in paint. And an audience has to decide which celebrity's under the paint."
(Lou laughs)
Brennan: Amazing.
Ally: That's a future I want to see.
(laughs)
Brennan: I am going to need a strength saving throw from the Red Hot.
Ally: Chill.
(laughs)
Siobhan: Very chill.
"Lou: Chill, sick, chill."
"Zac: So, I'm going to add half my dexterity modifier to this."
"Brennan: Minimum of one. So one, all right."
"Zac: So, strength saving throw. It will be plus six I think."
Brennan: For the Red Hot?
Zac: It's plus five so I added--
"Brennan: Yeah, now it's plus six correct."
(dice clatter)
Zac: 24.
Brennan: Skipper you hit the turbo thrusters and just avoid getting target locked by the tractor beam on The Lady Pike.
"Everyone groans, relieved."
Brennan: You've avoided the tractor beam here. I'm going to need you to make an opposed check. Roll your scan. You're trying to beat a nine. They rolled low.
Riva: Watch out.
"Zac: Oh wait, I do have it."
Siobhan: Okay.
Zac: I have 11.
"Brennan: 11, they go to jam your comms. Riva, you yell, ""watch out."" Keep the comms from getting jammed. (vocalizes ship's thrusters) De la Vega comes back on."
"Jan de la Vega: Well, I don't know why you're being such a horse's ass about this, Takamori."
Zac: Takamori just truly doesn't know what else to do.
(laughs)
"Brennan: Says like,"
Jan de la Vega: Why do you want to walk outta here with half a ship when you could have a whole ship?
Zac: He's honestly thinking about this. (laughs)
Emily: Keep the bun not the hot dog (laughs) if you have to choose.
(laughs)
"Brennan: And we cut deep into the ship to a funky little apartment in the back of the ship. Margaret Encino, Ally, could you describe your character for us?"
"Ally: Absolutely, completely separate from anything you've seen so far this episode, my name is Margaret Encino. I'm a 24 year old entrepreneurial business woman and I work for UFTP, the United Free Trade Planets. I'm an executive, I'm actually very high functioning and today has been a mad house, okay. I had a revisions walkthrough for the Morocain Project followed by a virtual round table with the Troikani partners board. I paused for 20 minutes and checked my cell phone in. Okay, a little thing I like to do, 20 cell phone free minutes where I then had a full body tea tree and matcha massage. And then of course followed by my corner boss bi-cycle check-in. So yeah, I'm just kind of like in the groove I'm answering phones, I'm just working from home, WFH."
"Brennan: WFH working from home. Hell yeah. It's very humbly appointed here. Like a lot of executives that are very young, you, basically for 850 credits a month, you rent this space on the Red Hot, which a lot of junior executives do because being on a ship actually has advantages over being like trapped on a planet somewhere."
Ally: It's also like kind of fun. Like these people are artists.
(laughs)
(Zac and Brennan vocalizes laser shots)
"Margaret: Oh my gosh, what is going on up there?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you actually do, in your apartment, up above hear like (vocalizes buzzing) and you like look at your little porthole and see like a buzzsaw moving into the ship behind you."
"Margaret: Okay. That's not good. Oh, I have so much on my plate right now."
Ally: Can I walk up and just try to help really quick?
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure."
"Ally: I'm going to throw my hand in and I have a disruption that I can cast like from the ship. So I'll just do hack communications as an action. I'm going to expend a power die and choose any number of ships that I can see within 600 feet. So I think that would just be all of these guys. They have to succeed a wisdom saving throw, or they take ionic damage equal to the number that I rolled plus our charisma modifier. And on a failed save all of their communications are disabled until they reboot."
Siobhan: Wow.
Brennan: Amazing.
Ally: And then I'm going to get back to work.
"Brennan: And then I'm going to get truly back to work. So first of all, in order for you to do this you have to hack into the ship's systems. So a little com, this is the thing that you like little comms open up. You see Margaret show up on screen basically to like ask permission."
"Ally: It says, ""Margaret (she/her)"" like a Zoom call."
(laughs)
Brennan: You see Margaret show up on your comms screen here.
Norman: Hi Margaret.
"Margaret: Hi. Good morning. It's me, Margaret Encino."
Norman: Good morning.
Margaret: I'm noticing that we're having a little bit of a disruption?
"Norman: Yeah, there's a little bit of a thing going on right now. Can I help you with anything, do you need like hot water or something?"
"Margaret: No, no, no. I have all the matcha I need. Thank you. I'm just going to use a power die and I will be hacking communications within 600 feet. Is that okay?"
"Norman: That is awesome, that is great."
"Margaret: Fantastic, you know, before I went to school, I was studying to be an operator. So this is like."
"Norman: Yeah, if you want like a job, like an actual job here, let me know."
"Margaret: Oh no, I'm absolutely loaded with a maxed out 401k. I think I'll stick with what I'm doing, but it's so great to talk to you. (mimes typing, looking at her screen)"
(laughs)
"Brennan: Incredible, so within 600 feet of you oh my fucking god. (laughs) It's literally all of them that are close to you."
Siobhan: The one competent person on the ship.
"Ally: Someone's on hold right now. I'm like,"
"Margaret: Hey, I'm so sorry. I'll be right with you in just a second and I apologize."
(vocalizes electricity crackling)
"Brennan: This EMP goes off. What you actually do is you go through the ship's like transmitter. You recognize these are Armstrong Roid Removers, UFTP owns Armstrong."
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: So you're just going to go into your corporate database and like, this is effectively you sending an email to someone to like remote disable as many of these as possible."
(laughs)
"Margaret: Hey, I'm going to need these model numbers shut down."
"Ally: And I just, kind of."
"Brennan: Incredible, go ahead and roll a power die and add one. So roll one d6 and add one."
(laughs)
Ally: That's a four. It looks like to everyone.
"Brennan: Oh, pulling an Ally, we're back in the dome, baby."
"Ally: I just, my hands get so sweaty. I'm having so much fun."
"Brennan: All of those droids take four points of damage. As you watch all of them start the sequence of getting shutdown remotely. It will take some time for all of them to get fully shut down in that way. Coming up on your screen as you're doing that one handed you see with like sort of metallic green make up sort of smiling at you, hologram is Lucienne Rex, who is your sort of peer in a different department at UFTP."
"Lucienne: How's it going, Marge?"
Margaret: Lucy!
"Lucienne: Hey, Margie, how are you doing, sweetheart? Are we excited for this four o'clock?"
"Margaret: Yeah, definitely. I'm completely ready. How about you?"
Lucienne: Completely ready.
"Margaret: I figured, right."
"Lucienne: Yeah, I figured, too. Good to see you."
"Brennan: You see that she looks over at you and says,"
"Lucienne: By the way, I just want it to holler about a couple things 'cause I know that we're going to be on with them in like 30 seconds, but the Monarch of Rubien V contacted me, apparently they found out that the moon they live on is made of pure lithium. Do we want to pay him off or do we just want to call in some, you know, troopers and take care of it that way?"
"Margaret: Ew, I hate that."
"Ally: Wait, so they found out that they live on lithium?"
"Brennan: UFTP owns a tremendous number of planets. On a planet that you guys technically own there is a monarch of that planet who is actually you are several like notches in the leadership above. So you could fire this monarch if you wanted to, but they are claiming that they want to have a rebellion because they've found out their moon is fully made of lithium."
Ally: Which is good.
"Brennan: Which is good. They basically found out that they're getting a bad deal, that you guys are excoriating their home world for the lithium it's made out of."
"Ally: Okay. Okay. Then I go back to Lucienne,"
"Margaret: You know what, let me handle this. We'll do something that will… hm…"
"Lucienne: I mean, it's pretty simple. We can just sort of scrub the problem if you want to."
Margaret: Yeah interesting. You already have so much blood on your hands. I'm sure you'd love to do that.
"Ally: And while I'm talking, I'm like filling out, like essentially this world's like Reddit and I'm like leaking all of this information and trying to like start the rebellion."
(Brennan laughs)
"Ally: So there are like a number of like, kind of subreddits of like."
"Brennan: Incredible, so you're trying to start the rebellion there."
Margaret: Like that's so interesting. Yeah. We should definitely take care of that.
(vocalizes beeps)
Alert: Conference call beginning.
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: As you merge in this conference call you and Lucy go in and Lucy says,"
"Lucienne: Margie, your big heart is going to get you in trouble."
"Brennan: And you cut back through years of like business school, academic, like getting your first job out of business school, clawing through like corporation after corporation after corporation. Your parents like kind of becoming strangers to you over the years, just constantly wind surfing somewhere. You don't know where."
Ally: They love each other so much.
(laughs)
"Brennan: You have this memory of years, years prior, you and Lucienne walking out of business school together. She looks at you and just sort of goes like,"
"Lucienne: (sigh) Well, you have the degrees. UFTP, right?"
Margaret: Yeah.
Lucienne: I'm glad to be doing it with you.
"Margaret: Same. I couldn't do it if I was by myself. I mean, just. (makes vomiting facial expression)"
Lucienne: Listen before we're like in the shit do you wanna make a promise to each other?
Margaret: Yes.
"Lucienne: It's a fucking grind out there and you and me, we don't come from any of the big families out there. We're not so-and-so Medea. We're not so- and-so Griivarr. Let's just keep each other's backs the whole time, okay."
Margaret: That's so funny that you say that because I got you this
"Ally: and I pull out, I have like a matching necklaces that have like, kind of like a little gear cog on them."
"Brennan: She takes it and goes,"
Lucienne: Oh my God.
"Margaret: It's kind of tongue in cheek, but yeah, this is just to remind us we're more than that."
"Lucienne: Hey, it's like that leadership summit, right, What is it? The platinum cog?"
"Margaret: My god,"
Margaret And Lucienne: The Platinum Cog Leadership Summit.
Margaret: Whoa yeah.
"Lucienne: Hey, we might be cogs. We're platinum baby."
(laughs)
"Brennan: And you zoom back into this conference call and you see your direct supervisor, Damien Factor, looking out and saying,"
"Damien: All right, it looks like we got all departments on the call here. Hello, Lucienne. Hello, Marge. Hello to all of you. Great, great, great. Marge maybe a little noise, like a giant saw and some hyon beams firing from you."
"Margaret: Oh, that's so great."
"Ally: I turn on like a filter that I've had, like made."
Brennan: Amazing.
Margaret: So sorry.
Emily: Get like a background so the space battle isn't there.
(laughs)
"Brennan: Amazing,"
"Damien: And by the way, a little bit of personal news up top personal and professional, we have some congratulations that are in order. We want to say congratulations to our own Lucienne Rex for number one, her engagement"
"Brennan: and you see a little round of applause. And she goes,"
"Lucienne: Thank you, thank you."
Damien: And her promotion to the Open Executive Suite for Crown and Scepter.
(applauds)
"Brennan: And you see Lucienne directs her eyes down, does not look up at the camera on her holo recorder."
"Ally: I immediately, like go on the internet to find out who the fuck she's engaged to."
"Brennan: Oh, none other than Natalia Cicero Connie Lee Carter Bajar."
Ally: The owner of--
"Brennan: The original family of the original dread dictator of the Incorporated Elysian Republic, who later took all of their imperial earnings and founded Crown and Scepter, which is the parent company of United Free Trade Planets."
"Margaret: Oh, cool promotion."
"Ally: If there's like a message capability, that's like private message."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: I just Slack her ""Cool promotion."""
(laughs)
"Brennan: You see, there is a ellipsis of typing in that message then nothing."
"Ally: I think to myself, ""coward,"" and then I mute everything, but I'm still on it."
"Brennan: You're still on the call. They start talking and you see Lucienne very quickly takes over the call and she starts going,"
"Lucienne: ""So obviously I'm going to be going into sort of a more managerial position during these meetings. Thanks to Damien who now we're going to kind of be splitting what used to be Damien's sole job, but it's a very exciting time for all of us here. And my goal is to see a younger, hipper, I want to see a United Free Trade Planets with, you know, kind of a more now modern attitude. You know, like, yes, we want to acquire as many planets as we can and own them. How do we do that in a way that is consistent with our mission and consistent with our corporate values?"
"Ally: I'm taking notes, and my note only says young, hip people don't have to say they're young and hip."
(laughs)
Brennan: We are going to (vocalizes air whooshing) move forward. All of the ships have gone. And now we are going to return into the initiative order back at the top. And we can take this turn all together. Can I get a reading of how many shield points and how many hull points?
Emily: Seven shield points and 27 hull points.
"Sidney: Captain Norman, permission to shoot the shark again?"
"Norman: Do anything, please. Yes!"
(laughs)
Brennan: Amazing.
Zac: Yes. Looking at this we have one attached to us currently.
"Riva: I actually think I could do something about the one that's attached to us, Captain."
"Norman: Okay, cool."
Zac: I think the captain is looking at this and he's like quietly wondering to himself like could I trade my crew for my freedom?
(laughs)
"Brennan: Riva, you fully telepathically hear that."
"Zac: And then I go, wait. I mean, la la la la la."
(laughs)
Riva: Just on the gunner channel the captain is thinking about swapping us for his freedom.
Sidney: Devastating. That means I've failed in my directive.
"Norman: You all failed, anyways."
"Barry Syx: We haven't failed yet. We're still alive, technically."
"Zac: Okay, well I think it makes sense probably to disengage and then take the full rest of my movement forward."
Brennan: Do you have a thing that you wanna try to do for the one that's--
"Siobhan: Yes, for the one that is attached I would like to probe the mind of the pilot within, which doesn't have a saving throw for the just upper level thoughts."
Brennan: Amazing.
"Siobhan: And I would like to very quickly understand how to work the buttons and stuff in front of him. And then I would like to Quicken power, psychic push-pull, to just press as many buttons that are just to get it off of us and away."
"Brennan: Oh my God, go ahead and spend the psychic points necessary to do that. That is so god damn cool. Give me a, I will say give me an insight check with advantage to read the surface thoughts of how to manipulate the device on there."
"Ally: Can we just agree that I'm on a conference call where they're talking about like, let's be cool and I have muted it and I'm only listening to this channel."
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, yes, yes, yes."
Ally: Okay cool because I want to be a part of this much more.
Brennan: Absolutely.
Siobhan: I got a 26 insight.
"Brennan: Incredible, you psychically reach out from inside this water bulb. You scan the mind of the person and just psychically, boom, throw the push, pull with your space casting venture, which allows you to cast at that double range. The one Roid Remover clamped onto you unlocks its clamp. You are free. However, there are four on you that will get opportunity attacks unless you disengage."
Zac: Okay. I think that means makes sense to disengage and then take as a bonus action and then take my movement away.
"Murph: I think unless we can take them all out, but it was pretty tough, just shooting the one."
"Emily: Yeah, I starting to wonder if I should kind of pivot and do something else."
Murph: We could rapid shot and take a chance.
"Gunnie: Also Margaret, are you on the channel?"
Margaret: Hey guys.
Barry Syx: Welcome to gunner channel.
"Sidney: Do you need another matcha, I'm kind of engaged right now."
"Margaret: Oh yeah, no problem. No thanks."
"Riva: Hey Margaret, say congratulations to your friend."
"Margaret: Oh yeah. I'll definitely pass that along. Thanks, Riva."
Riva: You're so welcome.
Brennan: Amazing. Let's get that boost engines.
"Ally: Okay, cool. Whoop, what do I add to that?"
"Brennan: The ship's strength, which is plus three."
"Ally: Oh cool, 14."
Brennan: 14 engines are boosted. You gain 50 feet of speed. So now the speed I believe is 350.
"Emily: Before we move, is it important for me to try to get that shark? Are we concerned about the shark catching up with us or are we just trying to put everything into getting out of here?"
Zac: Can I make a insight?
"Brennan: Yeah, give me an insight check and you have that pilot thing so roll with advantage, yeah."
(dice clatter)
Zac: Not great. Can I do perception?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: Okay, so that would be 16."
"Brennan: 16, and what are certain information are you looking for?"
Zac: I'm just wondering if it makes more sense to just hightail it out of here.
"Brennan: At this point, with your points as low as they are there is no surviving this in a straight fight."
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Emily: What are you rolling to do? What are you rolling on your ask? What, what type of check is it, intelligence?"
"Lou: Yeah, I will. I'm using my mechanics kit and my brain. Yes."
"Emily: Okay, then can I, does it make sense for me, instead of even doing anything with guns, to just cast enhanced droid through Handy Annie onto him so that he rolls all with advantage."
"Brennan: Handy Annie, already grants advantage on this, but if are you doing more than one thing or what are you doing."
"Lou: So I can make the Astro Nav check, I believe."
"Brennan: As a bonus action, yes."
"Lou: As a bonus action. So I could use my main action to either patch the shields or, you know, work on getting some of the shielding back or I can do something about some of this hull damage."
"Zac: I think, yeah, any sort of damage reduction. We’re— (laughs)"
"Lou: Great, in that case, I'll use Handy Annie for the Astro Nav boost check and then I'm going to do a patch check as well."
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: For the ship.
Brennan: Give me the straight mechanics kit roll for trying to get these equations.
Lou: Come on. That's a dirty 20.
"Brennan: A dirty 20. You get two more completed equations, three out of 10. And by the way, if anyone has other rolls or things they want to add to that you are absolutely welcome to do so."
"Emily: I mean, I think, I think there's nothing for us to do, but to just keep gunning these guys."
"Murph: All right, we're just going to gun the ones that are close, I guess."
Brennan: Hell yeah. And give me that if you're doing shield regen or if you're doing a hull repair.
Lou: I'm gonna do hull repair.
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: We're gonna go ahead and make constitution check with the ship. That's a plus three. Oh God darn it. That's just a six, which means that I have disadvantage on this hull roll so I roll two D6."
Brennan: Two d8 and take the worst of the two.
"Lou: Great. How about two eights? Okay, an eight and a four. So we get four points back."
"Brennan: You rush through, into the reactor room. Start to repair one of the burst pipes from, from this buzzsaw damage. Start patching the ship up some four hull points. That's your ship's last hull point."
Lou: Hull die?
"Brennan: Hull die, yeah. Go ahead and give me your gunning."
"Emily: All right, I'm just gonna--"
Murph: First for me.
"Emily: I'll shoot first, I can try and give you distraction. Okay, so I'm going to shoot a real flashy gun at whoever is closest to us. So just whichever droid is closest to us, but not the one that he softened up."
Brennan: Okay.
"Emily: And I'm going to do, oh crit baby."
(cheers)
"Brennan: Not the one he softened up, correct?"
Emily: Not the one he softened up.
"Brennan: Cool, cool, cool, brand new one."
"Emily: But, I'm doing distracting die so that he can have advantage on his next."
Murph: So we are using a power die. Who’s tracking that?
Lou: We are down to two.
Emily: And I am going to use my kinetic die to empower it. Does that mean that I get to add that twice?
"Brennan: Yes, you get to use that twice."
Ally: Woo.
"Brennan: By the way, I forget your ship does still have shields. Your ship regenerated four points of shields automatically. Four points used automatically. It also got a power die back."
"Lou: Yeah, down to two, back up to three."
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: Now down to two again.
Murph: She's rolling good.
Ally: Whew.
Emily: Woo!
Murph: One at a time.
Ally: Hey.
"Lou: One at a time, gotta savor each one."
Ally: Yeah.
"Emily: 21 plus 3, 24 points of damage."
(vocalizes gunfire)
"Brennan: 24 Points of damage. (vocalizes an explosion) One of the drones bursts apart, it's metal--"
Sidney: I knew I was good at what I do.
"Barry Syx: That's right, Sid. That's right."
"Sidney: Barry, I think I caused a distraction and you can have advantage on your roll."
Barry Syx: I'll take the one that I already hit and didn't kill.
"Emily: Oh, actually it was one more. Okay, just one more, 25."
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: Sweet, so I will shoot with advantage. Yeah. That's like a 25 to hit."
Brennan: 25 definitely hits.
"Murph: Sweet, and this is just a regular shot unless you guys think,"
Barry Syx: should I use power dice? Do we have a power dice? Should we go for it?
Emily: I just used a power dice.
Lou: Yeah. We're down to two. We got it.
"Murph: All right, hang on. I might use one after this. I'm going to take a chance on this one. Please roll okay. Seven, 10 damage."
Brennan: 10 Damage to the one you hit. Okay. It's still up.
Emily: No.
Murph: Power dice?
Lou: Hit it.
"Murph: All right, precision shot, please, please. One."
"Brennan: It's still up, I’m afraid."
"Murph: What? How much damage, I've done like 27 damage."
Lou: Did it work?
Brennan: This thing is hanging on by the barest.
"Murph: I think if I bonus action, I'm a barbarian. so I would get two."
Brennan: It blows up.
(cheers)
Brennan: That's what you needed. You crossed the finish line in a rage.
Zac: It adds up.
Brennan: It all adds up baby. Now here's the question for the pilot. There's now only two left on your tail with opportunity attacks. Do you still want to take the disengage?
"Zac: Norman is like looking into like the black void of space, like at his own reflection and just seeing the like 50 year old version of himself, like disassociating."
Siobhan: You just hear Riva's voice inside your head.
"Riva: Believe in yourself, Captain, believe in yourself."
Norman: Get out of my head.
(laughs)
Riva: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Norman: You're talking constantly.
"Riva: I'm not, I'm not lying. I'm lying, it's me."
Norman: I wish I had my guys.
"Riva: I'm trying it out, I'm trying it out."
Norman: I just wish I had my guys.
"Zac: He, yeah, it's just picturing himself with his Space Brigade. Just like, even though people are doing good around him, it's overall an overwhelmingly bad situation. Fuck it. I think he will do it without the, I think the dash."
"Brennan: Oh, do it without the dash."
"Zac: I mean, do the dash instead of the disengage."
"Brennan: No disengage, we're going to take the risk. So it's dash, move, and fly. We're taking three actions here. Now, hold on a second 'cause this is, because now all you're doing is gunning it and I believe you boosted engines this turn, right?"
Ally: Yeah.
"Zac: Mm-hmm,"
Brennan: So this is going to be 1050 feet of movement unless they clamp you. So I think this is Box of Doom worthy.
Ally: Oh my god.
Siobhan: Oh.
Brennan: Get the Box of Doom out here.
"Ally: Big roll, big roll."
Lou: First episode Box of Doom.
"Brennan: Okay, oh this is opposed. So here's the two numbers you need to beat with a maneuvering check. It's two eighteens, two 23s."
Ally: In what world?
"Lou: We, I think, does that mean we have to roll a nat or is that?"
Brennan: What's your maneuvering? What's your bonus to maneuvering?
Zac: Negative one.
(laughs)
Is it possible?
Brennan: We're going to need two nat 20s.
Lou: Fully dissociating looking into the black of space.
Norman: I'm done.
Brennan: It's a 10 and a 14.
"Siobhan: Oh, watch out on that 14."
"Ally: Yeah, yeah maybe."
"Siobhan: So, minus one. Oh no, because it wouldn't, it wouldn't be a crit then still it would just be 20."
Brennan: Correct.
Siobhan: Not worth it.
Murph: That doesn't mean we can't run though. That just means that there stealing speed from us.
"Brennan: Stealing speed, so instead of moving 1.050 each of them takes away 50 speed."
"Ally: Wait, but what about my hacked communications? Would that have, they're the closest wouldn't that have affected them, wouldn't they roll with disadvantage?"
"Brennan: Oh, let me see here. Hold on a second. Hold on one second. Something very wild and cool is about to happen."
"Siobhan: Margaret, you're very efficient."
"Brennan: You're very efficient, Margaret. You rolled a 10 and a 14, right? That's what you rolled."
Zac: That is correct. So that would become sadly a nine and a 13.
"Brennan: A nine and a 13, okay."
Siobhan: A literal wiener
Emily: Have we consider our stats are terrible.
"Zac: I'm going to use also, can I use defiant?"
Brennan: Yeah. You can add.
Zac: And add a D4 to one of them?
"Brennan: Yeah, so do you want to add to the nine or add to the 13?"
"Zac: The 13 I think,"
"Brennan: Let's get the 13 higher, let's do it. Yeah. Go for it."
(dice rattle)
Zac: Three.
Ally: Cool.
Brennan: It's now a 16. So a 16 and a nine.
Ally: Can I use defiant on one of the other ones?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
Ally: I have defiant also.
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Ally: Four, so that's a 13 and a 16."
Brennan: So a 13 and a 16.
Ally: Or a 20 and a 9.
"Zac: I wonder, yeah, I mean, can you add them both to the same thing?"
"Ally: Oh, maybe not. Okay 13 and a 16."
"Brennan: So hacked communications does damage to them, but it doesn't give them disadvantage on anything."
Ally: Okay. Yeah. I just thought if their communication is disabled and it's someone operating like a– droid—
"Brennan: Maybe yeah, you know what? I will rule that that can be disadvantaged. Is there any other actions before we calculate this fly on this round? Anyone else doing any deployment stuff?"
Murph: I already shot.
Brennan: Everyone's already done your stuff. Okay. You have a 16 and a 13.
"Ally: And they have how much to theirs, plus?"
Brennan: They have plus five.
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: Do you want me to roll against the 16 or the 13 first?
Lou: Do the 13.
Ally: 13 first.
Brennan: So we need a seven or lower. That's a seven.
"Emily: We need it, that's good."
"Murph: That's good, good."
Emily: Yes.
"Siobhan: Okay, okay."
Brennan: One misses.
"Ally: Okay, now we have the 16."
"Brennan: Now you have the 16, on a 10 or lower this misses as well."
Emily: Manifesting a one.
Brennan: That's a 19.
Ally: No.
(groans)
Emily: Now there's one there.
Zac: We got rid of one.
"Brennan: Amazing, so speed's still 300. You take three move actions. The Red Hot has one clamped on, but moves 900 feet forward through space."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: 900 feet is exactly what you needed for these drones to not be able to double move and get within striking distance again. Okay. The Red Hot surges forward through space. You have all gone. The four drones, two of them have hacked communications. Yeah. They're actually gonna do attacks with disadvantage. That's a miss. This crew back here is going to double move forward. These ones here are going to double move forward as well. The ship takes 11 points of damage from laser cannons firing down. All those drones are going to start moving it forward, except for the two that had their communications hacked. They fired, one miraculously managed to hit. The Lady Pike is going to double move forward. I am going to need another strength saving throw for the tractor beam."
Zac: Okay. (dramatic music) That is a seven.
Riva: Watch out.
Brennan: Go ahead and add the power die.
"Siobhan: Come on three, 10."
Brennan: 10 does not do it.
(groans)
Brennan: Let's move. You are hit by the tractor beam. Let's immediately move the Red Hot a hundred feet back.
Ally: No.
(groans)
"Brennan: Which does bring you once again within striking distance of those droids, you are also going to get fired on."
Siobhan: Oh no!
Lou: By The Lady Pike?
Brennan: By The Lady Pike.
Lou: Oh.
Sidney: Everyone please take a moment to be grateful for the shields that we had before they leave.
"Brennan: Gunnie, go ahead and give me a technology check."
Lou: That's going to be a 25.
Brennan: You see incoming heat signature of some Magneto Boy Light-Seeking Torpedoes.
Gunnie: This! Is! Bad!
"Emily: Maybe we can shoot them out, maybe we can shoot 'em before they get to us."
Murph: Are they slow?
"Lou: I don't think, I don't think they're slow."
Murph: Are they like coming now.
Brennan: Oh no.
Gunnie: These are the guys that come down and they come down fast. Grab onto something.
Barry Syx: Why even tell us about it?
"Gunnie: Seat belts on, can somebody tell the people at the workspace to grab onto a desk or something."
"Brennan: We're going to roll an attack roll here. I don't want to overdo it, but this is going to be Box of Doom."
(groans)
Emily: It feels like every roll has been Box of Doom this entire (laughs).
"Brennan: Plus five to hit, which means they hit your armor class on a three or higher."
"Murph: It's okay, it's a one."
Lou: It's a one.
Siobhan: It's going to be a one.
Lou: Barrel roll the hot dog.
Brennan: That's a five.
(groans)
Zac: Skipper is just like looking at the map of the ship. Like looking at where the escape pods are.
"Ally: They don't work, right?"
"Zac: No, I don't think,"
"Ally: I think one of my apartment, my apartment is an escape pod, right?"
Emily: I think we only have one and it's your apartment.
Brennan: The ship takes 31 points of damage.
Emily: Hull or shields?
Brennan: To shields and then goes past them.
Emily: So 31?
Brennan: 31 all told.
Emily: How many?
Murph: 20 total.
Zac: Should I? Do we have a power die left or no?
"Lou: No, we are out."
"Ally: Oh, yeah, we do. I can make one with my superiority die."
"Zac: Is that worth it? I have this, like, I can like take a D6 away with a snap roll."
"Emily: I think anything, any hit points are going to help us because I think, yeah."
"Zac: All right. If we can do that, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool, amazing. Go for it."
"Zac: Three points, reduced."
Emily: Okay so 23.
Brennan: And shields are at zero?
Emily: Shields are at zero.
"Brennan: You guys lose shields. Shield systems down, will not regenerate anymore. You are naked metal in space."
Murph: All right.
"Ally: We're so fucked, it's episode one."
"Brennan: It's a tough galaxy, baby."
Murph: Riva.
Riva: Yes?
"Murph: You're in people. You're in people's heads, right?"
"Riva: Sure, absolutely."
"Murph: Okay. I think Barry has a thought to himself, just like, I wonder if like Riva's magic works where like, if you can see like somebody on a screen, if like you could fuck them up."
"Riva: No, it doesn't work like that."
Barry Syx: Fuck!
(laughs)
"Ally: Can I pop out of my office and be like,"
"Margaret: Hey, so are we being chased like for any particular reason?"
Gunnie: We've got crates.
Barry Syx: We have stuff.
Margaret: Can we just dump the crates and then maybe they'll leave us alone?
Sidney: I'm personally inclined to keep them because that's how we make money. And money is how we make grenades.
Margaret: For sure. I hear every alarm on the entire system going off all at once. I do wonder if maybe–
"Barry Syx: What if, what if we dropped most of the crates?"
Sidney: What if this? I know-
Emily: is it our turn yet?
"Brennan: It's your guys' turn. Your enemies have gone, crew acts together on the ship."
Emily: Can I do a hologram that looks like we're dropping the shapes.
Brennan: What is the maximum size of hologram you can create?
"Emily: Just got these, so–"
Brennan: You regained one power die at the start of the turn. You do not regain shields. Shields are down and will require a true refitting to replace your broken shields.
Emily: It is a 15 foot cube.
"Brennan: The crates are, you could probably do one crate."
Ally: It just looks like we're shitting out one little pebble.
Lou: How many crates do we have?
Murph: How many crates do we have?
Brennan: You probably have about like 15 or so.
Murph: Keep the one?
Emily: Let's just keep--
Ally: One of them is a hologram?
Murph: Yeah.
Ally: We push out all of them and one is a hologram.
Murph: It's a believable trick. No? How much is one crate worth?
Ally: I'm down for this.
Emily: It's worth a try.
Murph: How much is the one crate worth?
Brennan: If these are full of Borinyum krystals this was a huge haul because each of them was 3K credits. You'd still have 3000 credits.
Margaret: I can help find you guys like work or something maybe. That's kind of the whole thing--
Norman: Let's get rid of the crates god damn it.
"Barry Syx: All right, but keep the one."
Norman: Let's keep the one.
Barry Syx: We can keep the one.
Barry Syx: That's a win.
Emily: We're doing one hologram in order to keep one crate.
"Gunnie: Skipper, you got this."
Norman: Shit.
"Riva: Skipper, the crew believes in this absolutely 100%."
Zac: Skipper’s going to voice or video chat.
(vocalizes beeps)
"Jan de la Vega: How we feeling, Takamori?"
"Norman: I'm feeling fine, we're going to get rid of our (pauses) 15 crates."
Emily: Why would you say the number…
Norman: 14-
"Ally: No, way lower."
Jan de la Vega: I better see 15 crates shitting out of that bird or I'll boot your ass to Byzon and back buddy. You better believe it.
"Norman: Listen, what can I do to get out of this, myself?"
"Jan de la Vega: Roll over, Fido."
"Riva: That's not his name. He has two names. It's Norman and it's Skipper. Or Captain, that's three."
"Jan de la Vega: Listen, you don't have the chops, Takamori so why don't you just open your craw and let me scoop them little krystals out?"
(laughs)
Zac: I think Takamori would open it to let them--
Brennan: Jettison.
"Zac: I think he's giving up, he's just fucking giving up."
Brennan: You're going to go ahead and jettison the crates.
"Barry Syx: You're not even going to keep one crate, Skipper?"
"Gunnie: Skipper, that's all of it."
Barry Syx: You gave him the brainstorm.
"Sidney: Captain Norman, my entire directive is to please people. Well right now, you have severely displeased me."
(laughs)
"Brennan: Do you want to, with this hologram plan, do you want to try to hold onto one crate or do you want to jettison all 15?"
"Norman: Sure, let's just keep the one crate or whatever."
"Brennan: Cool, you guys hold onto one crate of Borinyum krystal and jettison 14 crates and a hologram. You all see,"
"Jan de la Vega: This is Captain Jan de la Vega of The Lady Pike saying it's a pleasure doing business. Rough stars out there. Sorry for you luckless, abandoned, and forsaken."
"Brennan: Lady Pike comes in, scoops up the crates and the one hologram. You see that the Roid Removers turn around and follow The Lady Pike. And your shieldless, smoking (vocalizes crackling) and with no hull dice remaining, we exit combat."
"Riva: Well, that could have gone worse."
Gunnie: I honestly thought we had 'em.
"Sidney: I did too, I think it was cowardly to give up all those crates. I do. I do. I know that I'm not supposed to speak up against people, but there's other people right now. There's other people who want to do this. So I'm trying to please them."
"Brennan: You guys are so communicating over, you see that Raymond Zam pokes his head in and says,"
"Raymond: Hi, we're supposed to get an alert whenever the bay doors open 'cause we were in the middle of a quarterly graphics meeting. You know, we only have them once every three Nargons. And basically, you know, we had an emergency air lock and just was like a loud noise in the middle of a presentation. So, you know, we do it's because it's 10 credits per person, you know, to rent that space."
Norman: We'll just want to figure it out.
Raymond: Just a heads up in the future. Yeah.
Norman: Great.
Zac: He's just gone.
(laughs)
Ally: We'll figure it out or whatever.
Zac: We'll figure it out or whatever.
Gunnie: Should would go take a look at the one crate we got?
Barry Syx: Look at the one crate?
"Gunnie: Yeah, check the haul."
Barry Syx: Look at the crate?
"Sidney: Yeah, absolutely."
Norman: Can I say something real fast.
"Zac: And this is pure, obviously pure deflection on the part of the captain."
Norman: This is the most worthless crew I have ever had in my entire life. Not one of you know how to do your job right. And that makes my job impossible.
Riva sobs.
Norman: Yeah. Cry.
"Brennan: Tears join the water in Riva's bubble of a slightly different consistency, refracting light."
"Norman: Hey man, you're a coward."
"Gunnie: I'd cry if it wasn't expensive. (laughs) They charge me for excess hydration, but that, that was mean."
Sidney: I'll collect your hydration. Let it go.
"Gunnie: No, it's fine."
Sidney: Let it go.
Gunnie: It's fine.
Sidney: I'll suck it up.
"Gunnie: You don't have to suck it up. I can't put it back in, that's not how it works. But oh, okay, yeah, I'm a coward."
"Norman: I don't know what's going on over here, but we got to hit our shots."
Sidney: I did actually hit one shot really well. I don't know if you saw it exploded really big. And then it made it–
"Barry Syx: It was awesome, and hey that box idea-"
"Norman: Hey, you're a clone. I don't listen to you."
Gunnie: What?
"Barry Syx: Right on, right on."
"Norman: Okay. (laughs) Whenever we get back to where we need to go to fix this ship, I'm cleaning house. (to Margaret) You're fine."
Murph: Cool.
"Norman: Thank you for your, you know,"
Ally: We shake hands like really strong.
(laughs)
Brennan: Do you go to inspect the final-
"Norman: Yeah, let's look at the crate. Let's do one last job."
Barry Syx: You kind of took the fun out of it.
Norman: You know what–
Sidney: Maybe you could hold back and the three of us could go.
Norman: Maybe I'm not a fun guy.
Sidney: Look at it.
"Brennan: You head down to the hold. Riva, you swim out of your bulb, a pane opens up so you can look out through the water system. Gunnie, you're walking through the ship, seeing all the areas that are air locked off damaged for the hull. An incredible amount of damage has occurred. Both gunners come down here."
"Emily: I stopped my wheels so that I can skateboard over some of the damage or I mean rollerskate over some of the, or walk over rather than--"
Brennan: You can't roll over some of the damage.
Sidney: Oh my this damaged terrain.
Brennan: You pop the crate expecting stacks of Borinyum krystals. Some sort of parasite clearly got into the crate.
Norman: Great.
"Brennan: And you see a lot of rotted sacks of imitation, powdered egg substitute."
(applauds)
Riva: I love imitation powdered egg substitute.
"Norman: Isn't that fun, right?"
Sidney: Maybe we could sell—
Norman: What else could go wrong today?
Sidney: —the parasite?
"Norman: Oh, look there were krystals in here. Oh, it's like egg sacks and shit. What else is in here?"""
Zac: And he starts digging through it.
(laughs)
"Norman: What else, what could go wrong?"
"Brennan: As you dig through some of the devoured bags that some parasite got in all of you watch and see a flash of green goo fly into the Captain's face and shoot up his nose. That's all for this episode of Dimension 20, ""A Starstruck Odyssey"". Tune in next week. See you in the stars."
Siobhan: See you in the stars.
Ally: Wow.
Lou: Wow.

Sidney: He smushed his face against the glass.
Barry Syx: Why don't we do like a light mutiny.
"Sidney: Captain Norman, no one tried to pickpocket you while you were unconscious."
Lou: This is where the ball is rolling up the hill.
Brennan: What do you want me to say?
Ally: I want you to apologize.
Barry Syx: What is the Pleasure Putty?
Margaret: What is the Pleasure Putty?
"Riva: Oh, I'm so glad that you asked. I have a, somewhat of a rudimentary grasp of human anatomy."
Emily: I look at Margaret so haunted.
Ally: I'm kind of doing a little dance.
Lou: Things are great today.

(upbeat dramatic music)
"Brennan: Hello, one and all! Welcome back to another thrilling episode of ""Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey”! I'm your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan, with me, as always, are our Intrepid Heroes. Say hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"All: Hi, Intrepid Heroes!"
"Brennan: Ah, music to my ears. Oh, victory, victory."
Emily: What? We didn't.
Lou: We won!
Emily: We are not victorious.
"Ally: No, that was a victory."
"Murph: We kept a box, there was nothing in it."
"Lou: No, we got a whole box!"
Emily: Except goo.
"Brennan: Oh, that's right."
Murph: But we got a box.
"Brennan: Last we left off, our Intrepid Heroes they were aboard the Red Hot in the Hecatoncheires asteroid cluster with a crate that they believed was gonna be full of borinyum krystals, but instead was full of some spoiled, powdered imitation egg substitute, bummer. You see, (beeps) AnarchEra 220. The Red Hot, a hot dog-shaped starship floating in the twinkling starlight in the asteroid cluster. And lying out on his berth in the captain's quarters with his own personal med-kit hooked up to him is the unconscious Skipper. Who has been moved here after some kind of weird reaction. Hard to tell exactly what it was. Could have been some weird chemical reaction of whatever spoiled the egg substitute, could've been some bit of the ship malfunctioning, the ship took a lot of hull damage, shields are down."
"Emily: I think it is my duty as a companion droid to be doing medicine checks, but my heart is not in it, so may I do them with disadvantage?"
Brennan: You absolutely may.
Emily: I feel kind of angry at Captain Norman.
"Brennan: Yes, go for it."
Emily: Okay. That's a seven.
"Brennan: A seven, the captain is breathing."
Emily: I report that intel.
Murph: It's good.
Ally: We're all standing there.
Murph: That's good.
"Brennan: Actually, yeah I think probably you are all standing here in the captain's quarters. It is also not lost on you that the captain's quarters are way nicer than any other part of the ship."
Sidney: I actually knew that 'cause I clean them.
Margaret: How much does he pay?
Gunnie: This is the first time I've been in here. This is amazing!
"Sidney: Yeah, he's been auditioning new carpets too."
Gunnie: He was gonna put carpet in here?
Margaret: Auditioning?
Riva: He's bought multiple carpets?
Sidney: Multiple carpets.
Riva: With what money?
Brennan: You can see there's a book of 40 carpet swatches.
Barry Syx: Might just take these swatches and use them as a pillow.
(gentle steady beeping)
"Brennan: Beep, yeah? All the vital signs are stable. With the report that your captain is stable a moment of held breath releases, it seems the captain will be okay and you are just left in this situation. I'm gonna need a couple of rolls post-battle, things can still get worse."
"Siobhan: Oh, good."
"Brennan: I am going to need, first, a charisma check from the ship, with the current skipper unconscious I'm gonna need the secondary pilot to go ahead and give me a charisma check for the ship."
"Sidney: Okay. Don't worry, I'm very charismatic."
Siobhan: I'll direct that.
"Brennan: Okay, go ahead and roll with advantage."
"Emily: Okay. Well, I got an 11."
Brennan: An 11?
Emily: 11.
"Brennan: It's a DC 10 check. The charisma check, the ship taking damage. None of the Jib-Job workers were alienated enough to end their Jib-Job contracts. So you did not lose-"
Zac: That's shocking.
Emily: Can we say that mechanically what I did was that I heated up a bunch of coffee and roller skated around and handed it out?
Brennan: Yeah.
Emily: For morale?
"Brennan: You see Raymond, you see Ray Zam goes,"
"Raymond: ah, Sid, thank you so much. Ooh, this is great. Do you steam the milk in a steamer?"
Sidney: With my gun!
Emily: And then I foam it like a latte with my gun. Only a little bit of bullet shrapnel falls in.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see Raymond, there's also another Jib-Job worker here, Autumn, who is not part of the quarterly graphics meeting. She's actually unrelated to their little startup. She just uses the space to work on what you would understand to be stage plays. Looks up and goes,"
"Autumn: oh my God, this is so good. Just a little espresso? (sips) Mm. It does taste like, uh, metal."
"Sidney: Absolutely, which is why I love it so much."
"Autumn: Thanks, Sid, you're the best. Appreciate it."
"Sidney: No, thank you for the positive feedback."
Siobhan: Can I cast Affect Mind on Autumn to make her like the coffee more?
"Brennan: Yes, you can, I'll roll."
Emily laughs.
"Brennan: She rolls a five on the die and goes,"
Autumn: I love this coffee.
Sidney: Thank you. Did you know that I'm programmed so the more I please someone the better I feel about myself?
"Autumn: Huh, well, that's a lot to put on me. But right now, for some reason, I feel good about that."
Brennan: You look over her shoulder and see Riva.
Emily: I willfully pretend that it's my work and I just moon skate away like the most popular girl.
Brennan: Incredible.
Sidney: These Jib-Job people love me!
"Brennan: Yeah, a little bit perturbed by the incredibly violent space fight, but plied with gunmetal tasting coffee, the Jib-Job workers, it's 11 on a DC 10. So they're not, they’re like, you know what? The free coffee is nice. Incredible. The other roll I'm gonna need, give me a roll of one d20 and one d10. Add them together, let me know what you get."
"Emily: Okay.One d20, sixty-six."
"Murph: Wait, that's a nine."
"Emily: Oh, nine."
Murph: 15.
Emily: Nine and a six.
"Brennan: 15? Amazing, rolling high was good. You are 15 Malton Units away from your nargon upkeep. At the end of each nargon, your upkeep comes due. So you've got half the nargon left in order to hit that upkeep. That's when your upkeep is gonna come due, which is both 1200 Galactic credits for the ship's upkeep and then 60 credits for each of you. I should point out that 60 credits per month for all of you is a poor lifestyle. Meaning that it is not very comfortable, that's the bare minimum it takes just to get you through a spacer's life. But."
"Margaret: And you owe, like, double that, right? For all your parts?"
Gunnie: Double?
Brennan: Double?
"Gunnie: Oh, double, it's a lot, we don't have to get into it, it's a lot."
Margaret: I've just heard you talking in the halls before now.
Riva: 16.500 credits.
Margaret: Just kinda curious. 16 thousand?
Riva: He says it over and over in his head a lot.
"Margaret: Yeah, I was wondering what that was, that's what you owe monthly?"
Gunnie: Yeah. (stammers) Yeah.
Riva: That's the base monthly rate.
Gunnie: That's the base.
Riva: That just covers the interest.
Gunnie: Yeah. Yeah. It's okay. We're figuring it out.
"Margaret: Yeah, I mean, it makes sense to me why you would be so-"
Riva: I don't think you're gonna figure it out.
"Gunnie: No, we're gonna-"
Riva: That seems an unimaginable amount of money to me.
Gunnie: It's a lot.
Riva: Do you know how much Pleasure Putty I would have to sell to make just 16.500 credits?
"Margaret: What is, I mean-"
"Barry Syx: Yeah, what is the Pleasure Putty?"
Margaret: What is the Pleasure Putty?
"Riva: Oh, I'm so glad that you asked! Because, have I got some information for you. Now, whether you are a humanoid who has one of the meat tentacle things, or if you're a humanoid that doesn't have one, but likes the sensation of it, or if you have one of them but you also like the sensation of it, or if you have one and you like the other thing, I have somewhat of a rudimentary grasp of human anatomy, but I think you all get the gist."
"Margaret: I do have a pleasure tentacle thing, yeah."
Sidney: Only one. May I have one to try it out?
Riva: Oh.
Sidney: In the future?
"Riva: It does cost, so there are several different packs that you can buy. So, the basic-"
Emily: Can I Sleight of Hand one from her?
"Brennan: Unfortunately, she's in a completely contained water system on the ship."
"Emily: Okay, I Sleight of Hand against the glass."
Brennan: Plink!
Sidney: Shit.
"Murph: Easy, Sid, easy."
Emily: I just wanted to put it in my gun.
Margaret: So do you put the Putty on yourself or does the Putty become you?
"Riva: I think it will be, once you have it, quite self evident as to how it's used. So there are six different flavors that you can have."
Margaret: Flavors? Alright.
"Riva: So if you get a Basic Putty Pack, it's a random flavor, but you can get a six pack and that is five credits reduced if you were to get a six pack, okay? And the flavors are, they're orange, you can have chocolate, you can have bizarna, which is like a banana but ooh, jazzy!"
Ally: Bizarna! (laughs)
"Riva: You can have meats. You can have ice blue flavor, or you could have Murph's Little Beans. And that's one of the flavors of the Putties."
Murph: Murph's Little Beans.
"Margaret: Wow, Murph's Little Beans?"
Gunnie: Just so I'm clear-
"Riva: Very sexy, I'm told."
"Margaret: It sounds like Max 2, right?"
"Gunnie: I know that you're working on the anatomy thing, which I appreciate, is it… You say tentacle."
Riva: Yes.
"Gunnie: Do you mean, (stammers) like genitalia?"
"Riva: Yeah, some of the human types have the meat tentacles and some of them, they don't."
"Gunnie: Okay, I was just confused. I honestly thought this whole time we were talking about arms and then I was like, a meat flavored arm? That sounds weird."
Riva: I see.
Barry Syx: I knew what we were talking about.
Margaret: I knew exactly what we were talking about.
Barry Syx: Is there any way we can grind this stuff up and make it fuel or something?
Sidney: I was thinking maybe we could put it in our guns and shoot it at people and they would have to succumb to pleasure.
"Riva: You know, as long as you pay for the product, I actually don't mind. And if you'd be interested in selling it yourself, actually you'd be your own boss and you get to make your own hours, which I haven't quite figured out how to do yet."
Margaret: I'm absolutely already my own boss.
Sidney: I am actually actively programmed not to be my own boss.
"Riva: Oh, fascinating."
"Barry Syx: Yeah, I'm kind of programmed that way too. I was made by a professor who kind of bossed us around. It was awesome."
"Gunnie: I honestly have too many bosses to become my own boss. Even if I was my own boss, I would still have another boss."
"Barry Syx: Yeah, as mean as The Skipper was, I'm feeling lost right now."
Sidney: I know.
Barry Syx: No one's yelling at me.
"Brennan: As all of you look around, realizing that it's kind of true, you are a little bit lost. You see (fizzes) that the ship has loose wires, sections that are cordoned off from-"
"Barry Syx: Yeah, Gunnie, what's the damage on the damage?"
"Gunnie: It's pretty bad. I mean, we are out. We can't fix it here."
Sidney: I can report that we have zero shields and 23 hull hit points.
Gunnie: Yeah. But we're out of the stuff that I need to repair the ship on the fly. So we would have to go to a krystal station to get this stuff we'd need to then start making repairs.
Lou: Is there anything I can do now?
"Brennan: Out of hull dice? No. There's not anything you can do now. All of the materials you would use to repair the ship, you are plumb out."
Gunnie: So there's nothing I can do. The Skipper's down.
Barry Syx: What is the total amount of money we have right now?
"Sidney: Can I, um. Permission from someone else to pickpocket The Skipper and see how much is on him?"
Barry Syx: Let's ask The Skipper.
"Gunnie: Yeah, we should ask."
Sidney: Skipper.
Gunnie: Skipper?
"Brennan: You guys look over and see The Skipper laid out. Beep, beep. If you want, you can give me a technology check to assess the damage to the ship."
Lou: Great. A cool 18.
"Brennan: 18's enough to let you know, okay. A refitting. An actual refitting would run you 200 credits per hull die that you need to repair. With all your hull dice depleted, that's a cool 1400 galactic credits just to refit the ship. Now that would normally bring your shields and hull points and shield dice and hull dice all the way up, but because your shields got totally blown out in the last fight, that's another 200 credits on top of that. So you're at 1600 credits sitting there right now. Given that it will take a day or two to fix that's another 40 or 80 galactic credits on top of that. On top of that are also the fact that your ship is currently Used, there's all this upkeep work that's not technically vital, but it means that your ship can have these catastrophic failures. If you wanna try to repair the Used condition, that's another 1.160 credits on top of that to actually get the ship like brand new. That's not including the lapsed payments on your transmitter codes and your registration. If you wanted to cover that, that's another 120 credits for the transmitter codes, which is pretty cheap all things considering, the registration's pricier, that's a thousand credits to do that. Refueling costs to get you back to actually refueling, 'cause it is 200, sorry. It is a hundred credits of fuel a day to fly this thing in real space. You are on a third of a tank right now, that's 2000 credits to go back up to full. Restocking food portions on the ship, obviously, 'cause you guys aren't allowed to touch any of the Jib-Job food. So to restock your personal crew larder is another 800 credits on top of that. None of that begins to touch the 1200 credits that's coming due at the end of the month, nor the 60 credits per person for each of you. And then of course there's the 16.500 credit."
Gunnie: That's my own business.
Emily: I pickpocket The Skipper to see if he has a credit card.
"Gunnie: Guys, we're looking at about $6.500 in upkeep. Like... (stammers)"
"Barry Syx: We don't need it to look nice, we just need it to be as it was an hour ago."
"Gunnie: Just to get it on its feet, we're looking, and if we're skipping fees, we're looking at around 3.200."
Margaret: I'll pay it. I need you guys to take me to that planet with the revolution.
"Gunnie: Wait, wait."
"Margaret: I'll just pay it. That's fine. Do you have— like, Now, can we do all of those repairs on a specific planet? 'Cause I need to go."
Gunnie: From where are you getting?
"Barry Syx: I mean, we'll do whatever you want."
"Sidney: Miss Margaret, fresh matcha?"
"Margaret: Yeah, please, are you cumming? Yeah, let's..."
"Sidney: I think my pleasure wires got crossed. Yes, I am."
"Brennan: Amazing, Margaret, as you say this, I'll just cover it, because again this is, you know, it's a hefty price tag, but this is not-"
"Ally: I think 3.200, especially taking out all the extra stuff."
"Gunnie: That's not paying our registration, that's just repairs, getting some food back, honestly-"
Margaret: And the fuel.
"Gunnie: Not getting that much food back, a little bit of food."
"Margaret: Okay, great."
"Gunnie: And about half full, not a full tank."
"Ally: Great, we'll do a conservative, just to get us started, but I can probably get us more money. Let's go. What's that planet called?"
"Brennan: Rubian V, it's a moon, but you can head there right now if you want to."
Margaret: Rubian V moon? Alright great let's get there.
"Brennan: Rubian V is a moon, yeah."
"Lou: Oh, quick, Gunnie's being on ships. What is, how much, could we make Margaret the skipper right now? Would that be mutiny?"
"Brennan: That is mutiny, but there are, again, this is AnarchEra, you're on the border of a neutral zone right now, so."
Barry Syx: Why don't we do a light mutiny? Where if The Skipper comes back-
"Margaret: My plate's kind of full right now, guys. But I would love to foot the bill, let's go."
Barry Syx: Okay.
Riva: Unofficial but real skipper.
"Barry Syx: Real skipper, and we'll, instead of throwing him out of the space airlock, you can have a job still."
"Gunnie: Yeah, we can be me–"
"Brennan: So Margaret, you get a little, bloop, message from Lucienne Rex saying, time to talk?"
"Ally: (sighs) Yeah. I excuse myself. I wave some sort of virtual pay,"
Margaret: Here's the 3.200.
"Sidney: Of course, anything."
Gunnie: You have to give it to somebody else. If you give it to me… don’t give it to me
"Margaret: Yeah, right, right."
Gunnie: Don't give it to me.
"Margaret: This should be the new skipper, right guys?"
Sidney: Put it in my purse!
Emily: I hold up my gun.
"Ally: I'm looking down the barrel of it, okay."
"Brennan: Incredible. You have that credits. You can go punch in the codes to get to, if you wanna take a jump there you can, or you can pilot to Rubian V on your own."
Lou: Do we have enough fuel to get to Rubian V?
"Brennan: Yeah, you do."
Lou: Okay.
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure."
Murph: And where can we get the repairs done?
"Brennan: Rubian V is a UFTP planet, so it would have the refitting stuff you would need to go there. You can just take 10 minutes to get the codes exactly right, get the equations. Amazing. Margaret heads back to her apartment. Sid heads up to the bridge to start piloting to Rubian V as you head back to the main room. Riva, are you gonna head to the bridge as well? Or are you gonna go somewhere, for Barry and Riva, I wanna know what you guys were doing."
Siobhan: I was gonna go check in on the captain and see if I can feel any signs of life in his head.
Zac laughs.
Brennan: You go to the captain.
"Murph: I guess I'll go, I'm kinda pumped that Sid's getting to fly the ship so Barry's just standing there,"
"Barry Syx: alright, not just for blasting stuff! Gunner channel, moving up in the world."
"Sidney: Roids and droids, let's do it."
"Brennan: Incredible, so all of you head off with this wild thing that this United Free Trade Planet executive just dropped 3.200 credits like it was nothing."
"Emily: I think I'm like a dog, a stray dog that you've fed right now."
"Brennan: Margaret, as you walk back, you do know that there could be a headache in jacking a ship like this. Because you know that this dude had Brigade connections and the Amercadian Space Brigade is notoriously grouchy about people messing, even with people that they've kind of discarded, they still have that sense of ownership over."
Ally: If he comes back?
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah. It could be a hassle. We're gonna cut from here to another space. (dramatic electronic music) A space of darkness. Wet, warm darkness. (Brennan squelches) Zac. Your character. Your real character. You, for time out of mind, you have been suspended in cryogenic slumber. Unintentional, the freezing cold of space. (whooshing) Something changed, you moved somewhere warm. With gravity, humidity, tactile senses...ready, poised. Something moved. Opportunity. Moving on it, you've entered a space and you feel ahead of you finally, your target, your home. (squelches) You rest easy with a shiver of comfort and security wrapped around a brand new brainstem. The controls of this body-craft begin to ripple through your consciousness. You immediately understand. You have heard of these before. They're not uncommon in the galaxy. They're quite far-flung. You have found a human being. And its controls, of course, light up is not a term that you would use, but (whooshes) a brand new system comes into being in front of you. Where does your interest go?"
"Zac: As I'm sort of floating in this new space, I feel like it's like when you have been skiing, snow skiing, and then there's like, oh, a lodge! (makes whooshing noise, gestures as if turning towards the lodge) And I am going to check out whatever is just the most basic of understanding of just survival movement. Like when a baby giraffe is born and it has to learn to run immediately."
"Brennan: Okay, so your first thought is baby giraffe, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Riva, you are looking at the captain and from unconsciousness, the limbs in the bed flail and the captain launches upright and stumbles into the room. Give me a dexterity saving throw."
(Zac laughs)
Zac: That's a dirty 20.
"Brennan: You leap forward. Run. Your tactile senses, you log into this body- craft's tactile senses. You are experiencing gravity. And as you attempt the basic movement, you can sense that the body wants to use some of its appendages for movement more than others."
Zac: Yeah. So I think I immediately jump up. But realize that's not right. And just start running.
Brennan: Amazing. Do you try to run— What speed do you try to run at?
"Zac: Full speed, straight forward."
"Brennan: You smash into the wall and take five points of damage. Bam! Riva, you see this."
"Riva: Skipper, Captain. Are you okay?"
Zac: Can't fully understand how to control my eyes yet. And so I'm trying to access language.
Brennan: Amazing. You sense-
Siobhan: You actually don't need language to communicate with me.
Brennan: Ooh! So. I'm gonna need an insight check and a deception check.
Siobhan: Great. I think I get advantage on those from Empathic.
"Brennan: Oh, that's right, that's right. Hold on."
Siobhan: I also got a 26.
"Brennan: Oh, amazing. And what did you get?"
"Zac: Oh, I got a 12."
Brennan: Riva. You reach out and your mind ripples over and slightly permeates a brand new consciousness in The Skipper's body.
"Riva: Hello, stranger."
Skip: I definitely don't wanna talk in my brain. So I'm going to-
"Riva: Oh, okay. This is the only way that I can communicate, so. Also, just so you know, because people seem to be sometimes uncomfortable about it, I can hear everything you're saying inside."
Skip: Wait.
Riva: Okay!
Skip: Wait.
Riva: Wait for what? I'm waiting. I can tell the others to wait if you'd like. Who are you?
Skip: Hmm?
Zac: I sprint away from them.
"Brennan: Cool, give me a dexterity saving throw with disadvantage."
"Zac: That is going to be a… Oh, I have. That was a nine."
"Brennan: A nine. You hit a wall again, take another three points of damage. Boom. You sense, you might wanna grab some your sensory stuff in this new body-craft."
"Zac: Cool, I'm gonna try to access just being able to see. Being able to—"
Brennan: Give me a piloting check.
Zac: Alright.
Riva: You might want to open your eyes.
Zac: That's a. Only. That’s a seven.
"Brennan: A seven. Cool. You have a couple of different choices for stuff that you can open. You choose to open your mouth. Your mouth opens. (makes panting, tongue-lolling motion) You're having a hard time using this sensory organ to get a good sense of the room."
Zac: I try to echolocate.
(Zac yelping)
"Brennan: You manage to find the door. Riva, you lose the Captain momentarily. Gunnie, you are in the reactor core and see The Skipper with some of the sensory wires for the vital signs still attached and ripped out of the wall, walking down the hallway, going like this."
(Zac yelping)
"Gunnie: Guys, I think the light mutiny is over. Just be ready, I think the Captain's awake."
"Skip: Wait, wait."
"Gunnie: What, Skipper, what?"
Skip: Wait.
Gunnie: Wait?
Skip: Wait.
Gunnie: Wait?
Skip: Wait.
(Zac mimes running off floppily)
"Gunnie: Okay. Guys, he's headed to the bridge! (laughs)"
"Barry Syx: Pretend we were just cleaning it, pretend we were just cleaning it, Sid!"
"Sidney: No, I know! I put it into hypergear, we gotta outrun him!"
Barry Syx: He's on the ship!
Skip: I think this makes sense!
"Brennan: Amazing, you kick it into hyperdrive. Incredible. As you jump to, you kick in the Tachyon Drive, go faster than light. And (whooshes) in faster- than-light travel, Skipper comes aboard the bridge. Skipper, you've managed to open your eyes now, you have opened your eyes, you've been doing some echolocating, unlocked basic speech, but you see Barry and Sid both here."
Sidney: (mimes saluting) Captain Norman! No one tried to pickpocket you while you were unconscious.
"Barry Syx: Yeah, Skipper, and there wasn't a mutiny, light or otherwise."
"Sidney: Yeah, so that's just kind of filling you in on everything that happened while you were unconscious, sir."
Skip: Wait? Wait.
Sidney: Do you have a lozenge in your mouth?
Skip: No. Looking for the words. Hold on.
Zac: I'm just looking in my brain.
Skip: I don't know what all of the buttons do.
"Barry Syx: Neither do I, you just-"
"Sidney: I'm also a pilot. So if maybe… (to Barry) I see what's happened! Obviously the Captain is feeling unwell from going unconscious and so he's having a momentary lapse of memory of how to pilot. (to Skip) Do not worry, Captain Norman, I will pilot for you and again, no one tried to pickpocket you!"
Barry Syx: We can't stress that enough.
Skip: Okay.
"Riva: Hi, this is Riva, I'm just on the gunner channel so that's everyone I think except for the Captain."
"Barry Syx: What’s up, gunners?"
"Riva: Just so you know, I don't think it's actually the Captain. I think it's something else that's controlling the Captain."
"Barry Syx: This guy was kind of nice, so I was wondering."
"Riva: Yeah, that's what I thought."
Sidney: So far this creature has not said anything that was deeply demoralizing.
Riva: He told me to wait without calling me an idiot.
Sidney: My sense of self is intact after one interaction.
"Gunnie: Yeah, probably if it was the captain, he would've said, ""wait, coward"" or ""wait, idiot."" He just said ""wait."""
"Riva: Or, why should I have to tell you to wait again, when he didn't tell me to wait the first time."
Brennan: Give me another piloting check.
Zac: That is going to be a 17.
"Brennan: As you hear this chatter over the radio, you can hear the end of the conversation that Sid and Barry are on 'cause you're back on the bridge. you begin to pull some flashes. You know that this organism that you have commandeered is Norman Takamori, The Skipper. And you have a series of flashes of deep outrage, entitlement, cruelty, misdirected self-criticism cast outward at other people. And I want you to make a perception check for me."
Zac: Does it relate to ships?
"Brennan: I'll say in this case, yes it does."
"Zac: That's going to be, sorry, perception?"
Brennan: Mhmm.
Zac: That's gonna be a 17.
"Brennan: You’re looking. This psychic being on the ship has really fucked you up. This is a bad state of affairs that something has clocked that something is wrong. As you're sitting here gauging the danger, all of the stress you are feeling, all of the anxiety you are feeling at the fact that this craft you have commandeered is now suddenly maybe in risk of being discovered, all of it melts away. You are on the bridge and you look out through the panes of glass. You don't know what you're seeing. Endless Void and beyond counting, twinkling stars. You've never seen something this vast before. You have an understanding that that space has to be what you knew as the Void. Your perception of the Void was just your experience of being frozen by it. And this, this endless scape of stars before you, sitting there, waiting. Shimmering. In the vastness of a galaxy full of untold stories."
Emily: I report on the gunning channel.
Sidney: He smushed his face against the glass! He smushed his face against the glass and he's blowing his own breath on it!
Zac: Just like fog.
"Brennan: Zac, what's going on with The Skipper right now?"
"Zac: I think Skipper is, having been frozen, just floating through space for so long, is seeing it in a place that is warm and relatively comfortable in some ways despite the possibly hostile situation I'm in. And seeing that he is in a vessel that has the ability to make a choice and move wherever it wants to go."
"Brennan: You look at this vessel you are in. And it's like some sort of matryoshka doll, you're kind of in multiple craft at the same time. You are piloting this body that you know has the capacity to pilot this larger craft you are in. You understand that this is something artificial. For the rest of the crew of the Red Hot, you have two of you on the bridge already. Riva, I assume you can come up here. Gunnie, are you coming up to the-"
"Lou: Yeah, I'm gonna follow."
"Brennan: Yeah, so Gunnie, Riva, Syx and Sid, you are all up here on the bridge, looking at The Skipper gaze out at the stars. And, Skip you also look and see the pilot controls of the ship here that Sid is stationed at."
(long silence)
Skip: Um.
"Sidney: Yes, Captain?"
Skip: So I'm...
Riva: The captain.
"Skip: Norman, the captain, Skip Takamori and-"
Sidney: Is that what you wish to be called?
Skip: Yeah.
Barry Syx: Skip?
Sidney: Then your wish is my command.
Skip: Call me Skip.
Riva: Do you like the name?
Sidney: So cool!
"Margaret: Oh, he's a cool guy."
Gunnie: That was so congenial!
Margaret: He's a cool guy.
Skip: Skip.
"Barry Syx: How're you doing there, fella?"
"Skip: I'm pretty good, how about you?"
Barry Syx: Big Barry Syx! I go over and I shake his hand.
"Sidney: Skip, can I make you a drink?"
Skip: If you want to.
Sidney: What would you like to drink?
Zac: He's furiously looking at memories and trying.
Brennan: Give me a flat intelligence check.
Zac: Okay. That is pretty good. That's a dirty 20.
Brennan: Dirty 20? You can remember any liquid you want!
Skip: Latte?
"Sidney: I make those really well. And the old Captain Norman never wanted them, or he wanted substitute milks and I just simply don't have access to that."
"Skip: Oh, never mind."
"Sidney: Oh, you need substitute milks as well?"
Skip: Or whatever.
Sidney: Whatever?
Gunnie: It's crazy! He's open to other things!
Sidney: I'm gonna make you the best latte you ever had.
Gunnie: Options!
Lou: Can I do a lore check or some kind of check about of the nature of this thing?
"Brennan: Give me a lore check, anyone who wants to. Obviously Riva's communicated what has sort of gone down here."
Siobhan: Can I telepathically explain everything that I've seen to Gunnie to give him advantage?
"Brennan: Yes, yes. Absolutely. You can get advantage on that lore check for sure."
Lou: That's gonna be a dirty 20.
Brennan: Dirty 20.
Emily: I got an 11 so I'm really focusing on the latte.
Brennan: Amazing.
Emily: I'm using Minor Hologram to make it smell like fucking Autumn.
Zac: Skip's in the corner going
"Skip: Norm, Norman, Norman, Norman."
Barry Syx: This guy's hilarious!
Riva: I like him.
"Barry Syx: Norman, Norman."
Sidney: Maybe it was a near death experience that rewired him to be nicer.
"Brennan: On a dirty 20, there's a lot of things that could be going on. Obviously the old Skipper maybe has had a sudden change of heart or there's some other stuff going on. There's also other stuff in the galaxy, you know. There's psychics like Riva, there could be some sort of psychic empath, telepath kind of stuff going on. This could be some weird lasting effect. You've read of certain tractor beam stuff, cerebroslugs, you know, other stuff. It could be anything really."
"Gunnie: Okay. You know? I'm into it. I like it. And I'm feeling Norm, the Skip, I'm into this."
Barry Syx: New Skip?
Gunnie: I'm into new Skip!
Barry Syx: Kinda into new Skip.
"Riva: You know, Captain, as we are talking, I've been an unpaid intern here on this ship for a year and I was wondering if I could maybe move up to assistant."
Skip: Okay.
"Gunnie: (stammering) Cap, I feel like we've talked a lot about how the quality of this crew is up to better missions. You've often said that, shut the hell up, get the hell out of my room. And I'm wondering, would you be open to doing kind of bigger and better paying stuff in the future?"
Skip: Okay.
Gunnie: Yes!
"Sidney: Captain, maybe it's actually a really good time for us to revisit the grenade budget that I made a PowerPoint and showed to you. I can just pull it up right now."
"Emily: And it's just a lot of pictures of me with grenades. Yes, you can see."
Riva: I love those pictures of you.
Barry Syx: It's a great calendar.
Zac: Gets like this. Puts his face up to it.
Skip: Okay.
"Sidney: Oh my goodness, oh my goodness. I get to take so few personal victories and that was one!"
Gunnie: This is awesome.
Barry Syx: Never been this proud to be on a ship since I was piloted by a Barry Two.
Sidney: I feel like this is what humans say it feels like to have a substitute teacher. Can we watch a movie?
Skip: Okay.
Gunnie: I have wanted to watch a movie with you guys for months!
Brennan: We cut down to the Jib-Job space. There's a small little plasma screen over in the corner and it's just all of you on a sofa. You have some popcorn that Sid's made.
"Emily: Yeah, it's coming out of my gun."
"Brennan: Yeah, pop, pop, pop, pop!"
"Zac: (mimes chewing on a handful of popcorn, spits it out) Spits it out."
"Brennan: Zac, do you think (air quotes) “Skipper” is keyed in enough to figure out that maybe-"
Zac: There was something going on?
"Brennan: There's something going on, that you've been made?"
Zac: Can I make an insight check?
"Brennan: Make an insight opposed by, I want a group deception just from our four crew members that are present here."
Emily: Group deception.
"Lou: Guys, we got this."
Emily: I have a plus one. Can I use Handy Annie?
"Brennan: Yes you can, for advantage, yeah."
Siobhan: I got a six.
Emily: I got a 17.
Brennan: 17.
Murph: 15.
Brennan: 15.
Sidney: Grenade budget's a go.
Lou: 19.
"Brennan: So wait, 19 15, 17?"
Emily: 17.
"Brennan: So we're gonna actually take the 17 'cause in other words, two people made a 17 on the deception. Let me know your insight, Zac."
Zac: I only got a 14.
Brennan: Okay. Things are going great. It was a close call for a second. Close call for a second. But you think you flew in under the radar. The psychic kind of rattled you.
"Zac: Oh, I think that they don't know?"
Brennan: You think they have not clocked you.
Lou: I guess we all just watch a movie.
"Murph: We're calling you ""New Skip."""
Zac: I'm eating popcorn that's just falling out of my mouth.
Emily: I'm definitely sitting right next to you just feeding you popcorn.
(Ally laughing)
"Brennan: Falling out of your mouth. For all of you, do you, because you know that something is going on, but it seems like a way better deal. Actually, all of you give me an insight check, you give me a deception."
Emily: 13.
Brennan: What's that?
Zac: Nat 20.
Brennan: Nat 20? Incredible.
Emily: Can I use Handy Annie?
"Brennan: Yes, yes, yes, for advantage."
Emily: I wanna try and crit against you. I got 19!
Murph: I also got 19.
"Zac: God, the one time I've ever not wanted a nat 20."
"Brennan: I know, incredible, incredible. Well, I'm gonna say that we already have, so this is not for, you have been made by the crew. We don't have to retcon that. But I think that for all of you, what this deception thing is about is it's not that you are hoodwinked. It's that I think the deception is all of you realize. I think you (points to Lou) kind of actually know what's going on. (points to Siobhan) You have a firsthand account of what is going on, but I think all of you look, and there is a real, this deception is not I've been hoodwinked. It is a sleeping dogs lie situation."
Murph: Not gonna ask questions. Skipper rules now.
"Emily: I think I'm just like, I don't know, he got rebooted."
"Gunnie: This is a perfect day. We got money to fix the ship. We're getting better jobs, it's all working out!"
Sidney: I'm gonna be swimming in grenades. I'm gonna make a ball pit of grenades!
"Gunnie: Oh my God, it's gonna be incredible."
Riva: That sounds very dangerous.
Sidney: Dangerously fun!
"Brennan: Incredible. So, all of you are on the thing there. With that deception, go ahead and give me one last piloting check."
Lou: Good Zac react.
Zac: That is a 24.
Brennan: 24.
Zac: I remember the pilot seat's up there. Take a break from this
movie and go check it out.
"Brennan: Yeah, you're checking it out. You go and are just sort of interacting with the pilot's thing up there. The rest of y'all are watching the movie."
"Emily: As soon as he leaves we all start talking about it. He had something going on, right?"
"Brennan: Actually, what do you say as you get up to walk out to these guys?"
Skip: I...bath.
Zac: And point just out of the room.
Sidney: Bathroom?
Zac: I close my eyes and run.
"Brennan: Oh yeah, as you say bathroom, you do feel by the way, there are some systems that I leave it up to you to turn on. So right now, you have taste, smell, sight. You have hearing, language is on, you have some loose memories. Motion you have. There's some tactile sense stuff going on here. Do you wanna turn on endocrine nerve ending stuff? Do you wanna experience?"
Zac: I would like to turn that on if I was going to touch the pilot's seat or something to see what this is about.
"Brennan: Cool, do you wanna turn on pain systems as well or no?"
Zac: I don't think so.
Brennan: Cool. Leave those off.
Emily: Can't wait for that to backfire.
"Brennan: As you point out of the room, there's no pain receptors on, so you guys see the huge welt on the Captain's forehead from the couple times he ran into the wall. Just appears to be throbbing there on his head. You head up and you get in that pilot seat and with a 24 piloting check, you take off to Rubian V."
Zac: Yeah. I just feel the controls of it and just realize that I can actually make myself move in the direction I wanna go.
Ally: True old baby.
"Brennan: True old baby! We're gonna cut to Margaret Encino's apartment at the back of the ship. Margaret, 3.200 credits transferred. And you see that little message from Lucienne."
"Ally: Great, yeah, I hop on the phone with her."
Brennan: (buzzing noise) Hologram projector.
"Margaret: Hey, I know why you're calling and my congratulations on your engagement, present is in the mail."
Lucienne: I appreciate it. I appreciate it. How'd everything go? I notice you jumped on mute for most of that conference call.
"Margaret: Oh, yeah. But I was paying attention and everything so we're good."
"Lucienne: For sure, for sure."
Margaret: You're calling because?
Lucienne: Just wanted to check in. I got your message about the promotion.
"Margaret: Oh yeah, okay, yeah."
"Lucienne: Obviously, you know I'm gonna be looking out for you."
"Margaret: Mhmm? (laughs) I just think it's so funny, right? I mean, okay, let's just point out the elephant in the room. We fought to get to where we are and you married into the Scepter family? You accepted a promotion based off who you're married to? What is going on, girl?"
Lucienne: What do you want me to say?
Margaret: I want you to apologize! (laughing)
"Lucienne: You see, she looks at you and says, it's been years! Margaret, it's been years. What do you— You want me to apologize?"
"Margaret: Yeah, I know. No, I just don't understand you. What's going on?"
Lucienne: I don't wanna be a fucking cog.
Margaret: Exactly. So you wanna be King Cog?
Brennan: She takes the platinum cog necklace.
Ally: She's wearing it?
Brennan: It's off her neck.
"Ally: Okay, okay, she picks it up."
"Brennan: Picks it up. Looks at it and says,"
Lucienne: how do you think this galaxy works?
Margaret: Randomly and with no impunity at all.
"Lucienne: You said we fought to get where we are. I'm still fighting. I had to fight hard to get what I got. Both at UFTP and beyond. This engagement, what do you think that is, not fighting?"
"Ally: Whoa, do I know what that means?"
Brennan: Give me an insight check.
"Ally: Ooh-hoo-hoo. 18 plus a lot. So, yeah, 24."
Brennan: You see-
Ally: This is a career move? I'm asking with my insight.
"Brennan: Yeah, you realize that what she said, I mean, has to be, has to be."
(Ally laughing)
"Ally: Okay. I'm kind of doing a little dance. I'm talking to her and I'm doing a little dance. I'm like,"
Margaret: this is so sad.
Lucienne: Sad?
Margaret: Yes! What is?
"Lucienne: If I wanted to see sad, I'd go to Reddit."
"Margaret: Oh, fuck."
"Lucienne: You think I don't know? You think I'm an idiot? Margie, you're getting sloppy!"
Margaret: No!
Lucienne: You stopped fighting. Not me. You wanted to have my back? Then why did you start to lose your nerve?
Ally: So she has seen my whole post? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. How do I spin this? Can I do a roll to maybe spin this and keep my job?
Brennan: Hell yeah. Hell yeah. She's gonna add a tremendous amount to insight. Are you rolling deception right now?
"Ally: Yeah, plus six."
Brennan: Let me know what you get.
"Ally: Come on baby, come on. Fuck!"
"Brennan: I just hit a nat 20, for real."
"Margaret: No way! I posted that 'cause, you know, everything works, it's a pendulum swing. I'm pulling the pendulum back just to get a bigger payoff, you know what I mean? You don't know what I mean."
Lucienne: You're on that ship in your apartment?
Margaret: Mhmm. The hot dog one?
"Lucienne: Yeah, you're on that hot dog."
"Margaret: Yeah, where I live."
"Lucienne: Yeah, for sure. Why do you live on a fucking hot dog?"
"Margaret: I'm sorry, always on the move. There's nonstop diet chip stock here that I can eat guilt-free. And a lot of cool artist types live here, okay?"
Lucienne: There it is!
"Margaret: There's someone working on a screenplay, I think. I don't know. That was kind of cool."
"Lucienne: For you to keep that promise we made where we would always have each other's back, you needed to stay at my back and you lost your nerve somewhere along the way. Oh, one woman department, got it all covered. Multiple meetings a day. Making time for your care, boss-ass bitch. What's that Reddit post about? Why are you headed to Rubian V right now? You think I don't know?"
"Ally: I think… Ah, fuck! I don't know what to do. Um—"
"Brennan: As you are lost for words, she looks at you and goes,"
"Lucienne: You can feel any kind of way you wanna feel. But in the story you tell about what happened here, where I betrayed you, you better fucking flip that around. I never betrayed you. You dropped the ball, you lost your edge. I had to pick up the slack. I did what I had to do. Which of us is at Crown and Scepter, you or me?"
"Margaret: Yeah, you are. (softly) Fuck. Okay, give me a couple days and I'll get back to you."
(Emily laughs)
Lucienne: If you need a couple days.
"Margaret: Yeah, just a couple days. I'm going through a little bit of a free fall, okay?"
Brennan: Alright.
Ally: Can I look out the window on my door and can I see anyone in the crew?
Emily: We're definitely blaring the movie.
"Lou: Yeah, we're at the Jib-Job."
"Brennan: Actually, yeah. Give me a wisdom saving throw."
Ally: What? A saving throw?
Lou: That's the last thing I expected!
Ally: 16.
"Brennan: 16, okay. You just look out and see a group of adventuring spacers eating popcorn together and laughing, watching a movie."
"(Lou and Emily mime laughing uproariously, Murph puts his hand on Emily’s shoulder, Lou mimes throwing something into Barry’s mouth)"
"Yeah, you look out there and see the camaraderie. The joy of having survived whatever this battle was and coming together and Lucienne turns to you and says,"
"Lucienne: Yeah, reach out in a couple days, Marge. Let me know. You know where to find me."
Margaret: Platinum cog forever.
Brennan: Bloop. And the call ends.
"Ally: I don't know where I get it, but I do one of those things from every movie where I'm kind of leaning against the wall and I slowly slide down it while eating a yogurt. I'm having that very iconic female moment. Just like."
Emily: A diet yogurt too.
"Ally: Yeah it's a diet Boston cream pie yogurt and I'm just like, what am I doing?"
Emily: It's 30 calories.
"Ally: But something in me is drawn to this group! Yeah, I know. I don't know. I don't wanna lose that job and I don't wanna lose all of my clearance badges and stuff so I can't tell her off, but, there's nothing there, I think, there's nothing there."
Brennan: A profound emptiness colder than the void fills the pit of your stomach. Make an insight check and a deception check against yourself.
"Ally: Insight. 13 plus 6, that’s 19. Deception, plus, 12. I do have insight on myself because of the yogurt."
"Brennan: Because of the yogurt, you collapsed. Yeah, you don't wanna lose your job, you don't wanna lose your clearance. You fought real hard for all this stuff. What of the stuff that Lucienne said hit you the hardest?"
"Ally: I mean, it's really sad to see someone that you really respected throw themselves into something so fake so hard. What a life."
Brennan: So really it's the marriage more than anything else.
"Ally: Yeah it's like marrying someone in a big conglomerate family, like narsty."
"Brennan: Yeah, narsty, this weird. Well it's also, I think on that insight check, two things happen. Number one, a delusion that has been crumbling in your head for a long time, finally goes away. When you graduated from business school, even though you knew there was gonna be dirty work, part of you believed in the meritocracy. Part of you believed yeah, you gotta be cutthroat. But if you are, you get to the top of the top of the top. Not really."
Ally: No.
"Brennan: That delusion dies. And also, yeah, you see the thing that keeps come back to you, the fakeness of the thing. Lucienne in this fake marriage. Lucienne walking down the aisle, Lucienne kissing this scion of this ancient galactic house."
"Ally: Can I look her up, what does she look like?"
Brennan: Oh.
Ally: The new Scepter wife.
"Brennan: Oh, the scion of the? Natalia Cicero Connie Lee Carter Bajar."
Ally: Too many names. Yeah. Do a hotness roll?
Brennan: She's stunning.
"Ally: (laughing) Fuck! No, even as stunning as she is, this person's heart isn't in it. So it's still sad."
Brennan: Why do you think Margaret is so certain that Lucienne's heart is not in it?
"Ally: Yeah, 'cause she leveled with me. She was like, I'm putting in the work, this is part of me putting in the work."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You finish your Boston cream diet yogurt. It leaves a sort of acetone film over your tongue, teeth and cheeks."
Ally: (mimes putting down a cup) I'm not gonna brush my teeth tonight. Just to feel something.
Brennan: Do you depart from your escape pod?
"Ally: I mean, yeah, I'm gonna dip a toe in whatever the fuck my new life is, I'm gonna go watch the movie."
"Riva: Margaret, we're watching ""200 Fast 200 Furious."""
Margaret: What's it about?
"Riva: You know, it's family."
"Gunnie: Family, mostly family."
Margaret: It's mostly about la familia?
Riva: They actually haven't said any other words but family so far.
"Margaret: Wow, cool!"
"   Gunnie: It's a person who looks at another person, they go, ""Family."" and then they do something crazy! It's awesome."
"Margaret: Okay, yeah."
"Brennan: You take a seat and start watching this movie, it feels pretty good. After movie night turns in, people need to get their rest. Not everyone needs to rest but most of the biological people here, you know, Barry needs to rest. As you start to bed down for the night."
(dramatic music)
Let me ask if anyone does anything before arriving at Rubian V the next day.
"Emily: I do want to approach Riva and be like,"
"Sidney: hi, I don't know if you sleep or not."
"Riva: Well, what I do is I float in the water and half of my brain goes to sleep at a time. So I can actually still talk to you when I'm doing it, just one of my eyes will be closed."
Sidney: That's cool. Fish are better than droids. I was wondering-
"Riva: Not a fish, Aguatunisian, continue."
Sidney: I'm so sorry.
Riva: It's fine.
"Sidney: I was wondering, what does it feel like to be your own boss?"
"Riva: Oh my goodness. Well, I feel very bossy."
"Sidney: Okay, you feel bossy."
Riva: And I feel myself.
Sidney: You feel like yourself. How do you know what yourself is?
"Riva: Oh. Well, you are organic matter, so I can just show you"
Siobhan: and I just psychic dump on you the feeling of being myself.
Sidney: (gasps) It's beautiful.
"Brennan: This incredible moment of this android up against the glass with this fish, with this Aguatunisian psychic."
Ally: Del Toro wishes.
"Brennan: Yeah, del Toro wishes, exactly. Yeah, you have this flood of feeling. But of course, equivalent exchange, I think Riva, you also see some of Sid's backstory. You see the fleeing from Handy Andy. Coming aboard this ship. And a deep fear of displeasure. It's interesting 'cause you have this full feeling from Riva of being an organism. It couldn't be more different. Riva comes from a species in which breeding is very hard, but when it happens thousands of baby Aguatunisians are born at the same time from a clutch and communally raised. Riva never had any expectations put on them. Sid was designed. In other words, people that are like, what's my purpose in life?"
Sidney: I know my purpose.
"Riva: Oh, we don't have purpose."
Sidney: Okay.
Emily: And then I wanna take this feeling and close my eyes and go into my programming and try to hack myself to bring some of Riva in myself.
Brennan: Give me a hacker's check with disadvantage.
"Emily: Disadvantage, okay."
Siobhan: Can I help her do this?
"Brennan: Yes, if you'd like, go ahead and roll."
Emily: It's gonna be 25.
Ally: Oh!
Brennan: Incredible!
Zac: With disadvantage?
"Murph: Oh, no, she got help."
"Brennan: Yeah, rolled straight. You go in, what is the thing you are trying to unplug or change about yourself?"
"Emily: I think I want to be able to want something without needing someone else to want it, too."
Brennan: Let me ask a question. You want to be able to want something without needing somebody else to want it too.
"Emily: And without thinking of a practical reason. I know I can want grenades because that means I can protect my people, but I wanna be able to want an ice cream cone."
Brennan: Are you currently aware that anybody else wants you to want an ice cream cone?
Emily: No.
Brennan: It's already done.
Emily: I can want an ice cream cone?
"Brennan: You become aware that in wanting to want an ice cream cone without having checked in with anybody, it's a very YA novel protagonist feeling to want to want something is the want of wanting it and you wanted it without anyone else wanting it. So you already did want it."
"Emily: Everyone's gone down for bed, but I skate through the hall saying,"
Sidney: I want an ice cream cone!
Barry Syx: Yes!
"Murph: I wake up out of sleep, assuming this is just ice cream Barry night."
"Barry Syx: Yes, Barrys, ice cream! Oh, all right, Sid? Yes, ice cream!"
Brennan: It flashes back to the last time you were holding a big tray of ice cream pops.
Emily: And then I try to put an ice cream in my gun and it just keeps melting 'cause it's so hot.
Lou: Oh my God.
"Riva: The other hand, the other hand!"
Emily: And I retract the other hand.
"Brennan: Barry, yeah, you have that moment of cheering Sid on and stories then the shadows lengthen. You remember the last time you were holding ice cream."
Barry Syx: Barry Nine. Barry! You guys just hear me yell my own name.
"Ally: Your own name, yeah, exactly. All your night terrors, you're yelling your own name."
Barry Syx: Barry?
Skip: Barry!
Barry Syx: Barry!
Skip: Barry!
Riva: Barry?
Gunnie: Can you guys stop? I'm trying to tutor kids.
Riva: Do you have a second job?
Gunnie: Yes!
Ally: Wait!
Brennan: We cut to the engine room. We actually pass by Gunnie's actual berth but Gunnie doesn't actually sleep in his berth. What is in Gunnie's berth as we go by it?
"Lou: Probably stuff from the Jib-Job and Margaret Encino's stuff. I think if it meant that Margaret was gonna stay on the ship and we were gonna make more money, it was like, I don't really, Gunnie doesn't really have stuff anyway because people who he owes money would come and take it. So Gunnie has a bedroll that he rolls out in the reactor room and he just sleeps under the glow of this giant reactor."
"Brennan: Reactor glowing, you attach a couple of hoses and nozzles into your cyborg body that begin to basically clean your blood as it goes through. And from prone, you begin to holo-interface and you see a kid that goes down and goes,"
"Kid: Hi, Prof, Doc, teacher."
"Gunnie: Yeah, that's fine. What's the homework today?"
"Kid: We start with, this is basic calculus. But I actually had a question about the algebra homework."
Gunnie: Yeah. Okay.
"Kid: And my question. If you're doing a complex equation where you're trying to solve across an equation for two different variables, how do you...?"
"Gunnie: Can you just upload, will you just upload your homework? And I'm just gonna knock it out real quick."
"Kid: Awesome, great, done, thank you."
Ally: Oh my God!
"Gunnie: Great, send it back, next. Just move on to the next kid."
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me a, we'll call this just a raw intelligence check."
Lou: That's gonna be a 10.
Brennan: You make 20 credits.
Gunnie: Good night.
Brennan: As your cyber body recharges-
Ally: That's less than they would pay a classmate to do their homework.
Brennan: Just carving that money out wherever you can.
"Emily: It makes me realize what a bad deal we have for the Jib-Job people, they're paid 10 credits a week!"
"Ally: Oh wait, yeah, credits are worth more, then. Never mind, never mind."
"Brennan: Margaret, I think as other people disperse to go do their thing, you're still sort of, I think that you haven't checked on Captain Takamori in a while, you haven't checked on The Skipper in a little while. But you know that he got up, it came up during movie night. You are up on the bridge because I know that you were the one who called the shot to head to Rubian V and you see The Skipper headed to Rubian V up here right now, as you go faster-than-light, Tachyon Drive engaged."
"Ally: I go check on him. I didn't really know the guy that well, but."
"Brennan: Yeah, he was just the person that you had your arrangement with."
Margaret: So we're heading to Rubian V.
"Skip: Yeah, yeah."
Margaret: Cool.
"Brennan: You have a couple different places that you, actually go ahead either of you and give me a lore check."
"Ally: 20, not nat."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Worse.
"Brennan: Cool. Rubian V is a lithium moon off of the gas giant Rubian. There's a couple places that you can dock there to get the repairs you need to get. It's up to you. There's Madrugada Station which you can go to, which is United Free Trade Planets, it's their space station in orbit over the moon. The moon's in orbit around the gas giant and this is an orbit around the moon. Then there is also Shriagmaus which is the capital city of Rubian V where the monarch, Xhirhaus, reigns, basically. There are a couple other smaller stations, but those would be the two main places that you would do a refitting. So it's your choice to either go into orbit at Madrugada Station or to head to the moon's surface."
"Ally: Okay. I'm trying to keep up appearances at work I think, so I do wanna go to the UFTP station."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: So I relay that to him.
"Zac: Yeah, I think, truly had no reason to go here at all in my mind so I'm like,"
Skip: okay.
"Brennan: It's been a couple of marbecs and the body is coming more online now. You've stayed here a little bit longer. As you look in, you see this person and are able to access the memories that basically this woman has been subsidizing this captain's lifestyle that you took over. I think you also are beginning to understand the degree to which this captain was not that great of a guy. But as Margaret comes up and tells you to basically, when you come out of FTL to make coordinates for Madrugada Station and dock there. It’s not that— I think you see that this person is wealthy enough that they were not being taken advantage of, but certainly Margaret was financing the ship and I think you recognize that that's what's been going on."
Skip: You're important.
Ally: I start crying. (laughs)
"Margaret: (tearily) Okay. Yeah, thanks."
Brennan: You share this moment.
"Margaret: The word economy on this guy, and I just start walking away."
"Brennan: Yeah I think you see that clearly, something has happened with The Skipper but that just cut through years of your absence of therapy. Something."
Margaret: I need to go to my room and take care of a couple things.
"Brennan: Amazing, you go to your room, take care of a couple things. Go ahead and make a… Make a perception check for me."
"Zac: Just flat, just regular?"
"Brennan: Yeah, flat perception check."
Zac: That is only a 13.
"Brennan: Your new body-craft is secreting some weird stuff. You're detecting some kind of, you don't have pain systems on, right?"
"Zac: Mhmm, not yet."
"Brennan: There's a buildup of something in your lower appendages. It's some substance that the body is secreting, it's secreting it more and more. It's internal, so it's not leaking out of the body but there's an internal secretion happening. And additionally there is, how do you put it? And also you're getting some kind of sensors from systems that you haven't put online but they're happening in or around your eyes, which you've now sort of put together, okay, that's the organ that's giving me this new sense. A bunch of new senses have come online for you like sight and sound. Sound is much more like touch, which you do have in your body-body. But not to this degree, there's a couple other senses that this new body-craft is giving you access to. But you're like, okay, there's some kind of signal from around here which I think is an organ related to this new sense that I just picked up. Yeah, that's what you're getting right now as you come out of FTL."
Zac: Hmm. Can I look in a mirror?
"Brennan: Yeah, you look in a mirror. Yeah, you look in a mirror and see that your eyes, what was originally sort of white around the outside of your eyes is now getting more bloodshot. You're seeing a lot more red there. So that's sort of interesting."
Zac: Am I forgetting to blink?
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a piloting check.
Zac: No! That is a nine.
"Brennan: A nine. So you have not figured out how to blink but you have been doing it. You move your eyelids with your fingers up and down, which is what you think. So, boop boop. But for the most part you are seeing this, yeah, I don't think you know what's going on."
"Zac: Hmm. I guess I will look for, I might track down Barry's room."
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah, you go find Barry. Barry, it is coming to be morning. You get up, it's been a wild turn of events. But yeah, you see that the captain is standing over your bed, staring at you."
Barry Syx: Oh.
Skip: Hey.
"Barry Syx: Morning, Skip."
Skip: Good morning. Yes.
Skip gestures up and down his body with a puzzled expression.
Barry Syx: Right on.
Ally: Right on!
"Barry Syx: Right on, man, yeah."
Zac: And I leave.
(all laughing)
"Murph: I will say that Barry has many, many times had another one of his clones just show his body and the other dudes would always just say right on, man. So that was just like, yeah, cool. It's been a while."
Zac: I feel better.
"Brennan: Amazing. For mechanical purposes, take a level of exhaustion."
Zac: Oh!
Ally: Fuck.
Brennan: But you got no idea what that is.
"Murph: Wait, can I see that he looks tired and looks like shit?"
"Brennan: It looks like he stayed up all night, standing at the pilot's console flying the ship."
"Barry Syx: Hang on there, Skip."
Skip: Right on.
"Barry Syx: Did you, right on, it's early. When did you wake up?"
Skip: What is it? What is… What?
"Barry Syx: Like, you go into bed, you close your eyes. For a solid six to eight, preferably. Or you can do three or four."
Skip: I don't remember. Maybe...
Barry Syx: Pulled an all nighter?
Skip: Couple thousand years ago.
"Brennan: Give me a perception check, Barry."
Murph: Eight.
Brennan: An eight on perception. I think you see his legs shaking a little bit on an eight.
"Barry Syx: You need a rest day, my man."
Skip: I've just gotta rest?
Barry Syx: You need to chill.
Skip: Okay.
Barry Syx: Yeah. You need to relax.
Skip: Where?
Barry Syx: You can just relax in here if you want.
Zac: Okay. I lay down on the ground.
"Brennan: You lay down, you see his legs shake violently. The secretion is lactic acid in your quads. So if you had your pain sensors on your legs would be destroying you right now."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: But you see his legs shake.
Murph: I see his legs?
"Barry Syx: Oh, you need a foam roll. You need a foam roll, brother."
"Murph: 'Cause the Barrys worked out all the time. So I do a physical therapist, I'm like,"
Barry Syx: is this cool if I roll on here?
Skip: Yeah. Alright.
Murph: So I roll on his legs.
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys get a good, you come to, it's breakfast time. You see that Barry's rolling the Captain out on this foam roller."
"Emily: I think I enter the breakfast thing in a crazy outfit, like a kid who just dressed themselves for the first time. And I think I address everyone and say,"
"Sidney: I just want everyone to know, because I've never been able to say this before, I don't want grenades because they keep us safe. I want them because they make cool explosions and they destroy stuff and they're fucking fun to throw!"
Barry Syx: Hell yes. Hell yeah.
Gunnie: Things are great today!
Barry Syx: That was cool.
Gunnie: I haven't smiled this much in years!
Barry Syx: I don't remember the last time someone came to my room and asked to be foam rolled!
Gunnie: What? Did that happen?
Skip: Right on.
Barry Syx: Right on.
Gunnie: Right on!
Sidney: Right on!
"Brennan: The Red Hot comes out of faster-than-light travel, boom. The gas giant Rubian. Whoom! A luminescent red gas giant. Deep, blood red. The storms in Rubian are filled with quintillions of tons of diamond dust in a deep red gas planet. So it shimmers and shines, whoom. And you see tons of moons circling over it. There's more than a dozen moons circling the planet. You've come out and you see Rubian V, which for being a lithium moon, that lithium is at the core. It has an atmosphere, it has oceans. It's about one third the size of Earth for reference so the gravity on it is quite light. But you see in orbit around that is a space station. And you see Madrugada Station. United Free Trade Planets owned. This is basically like a company town. More than half the population here works for United Free Trade Planets the rest are contractors or other people like that but it is set up to, it's not a top secret UFTP base. There's a lot of people that come through and basically avail themselves of the services here. So a lot like the way that a gas station would be corporate, but still its customers would be all sorts of people, that's the way that Madrugada Station works, right? You see there is a central spire and then a bunch of rotating quarter-mile wide panels. It's like a central spine with little shelves going around a central spine. And there's tons of ships coming in to dock here. Additionally, because you've elected to go to a UFTP station, docking fees are waived with your clearance."
"Ally: Great. I beep us in. And then I, yeah, it's a garage door. I swipe my pass and then I look to everyone and go,"
"Margaret: the cafeterias here aren't that great. I would say three stars at best but it is all you can eat so I hope that that's okay, you guys."
Emily: Do I know if mercenary types might be hanging out in these cafeterias?
"Brennan: There are proldiers on station, sure. Not as much as if you were at a full rec station, it would be proldier city. There'd be tons of things like that. But if you're looking to use one of your features, absolutely you could use it here."
"Emily: Yeah, I just wanna ask around for a little extra work."
Lou: Yeah.
"Emily: See if we can, you know."
Murph: See if we can get a contract or something.
Brennan: Exactly.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Amazing. So let me go ahead and ask, first of all, about the refitting. Gunnie, are you gonna be working on the ship during this time, or?"
"Lou: I mean, as much as need be, yeah. We've got all the money we need for fixing the damages. Then the question becomes, we're doing a conservative fuel so we'll spend 500, get five units of fuel. Assuming we didn't spend too much going to Rubian V?"
Brennan: You only spent two fuel units going to Rubian V.
"Lou: So we're on eight, so let's do 700 on fuel units. So that brings us 1100 extra. Now we could use that to, you know, pay some of our late fees, but we could also get a bunch of stuff in the ship."
Sidney: Do you know what I wanna do?
Gunnie: No. What? What?
"Sidney: I wanna just buy cool shit! I say, fuck the late fees!"
Gunnie: That's what I want to hear! How much-
Skip: Right on.
"Barry Syx: What do you think, Skip?"
Skip: Okay.
Lou: Could we take off some of the Used condition with $1100?
"Brennan: You absolutely could. So, to be clear, refitting is 1400, another 200 for the replaced shield batteries. That's 1600 credits gone."
"Lou: Okay, so we just have 900 credits then in that case, I think with seven fuel units."
"Brennan: And then getting seven fuel units, absolutely. So, so far you've refitted, you replaced the shield battery. You got fuel units back. How much do you have left?"
Lou: I believe it's 900.
"Brennan: Okay, to repair the Used condition, it's 1.160 credits."
Ally: I give the extra 200.
Brennan: 260?
"Ally: Yeah, sure."
"Brennan: Alright, mark it down."
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: Gunnie, you can take two Malton units here on Madrugada Station. And you can get this thing like brand new."
Gunnie: You guys have fun. I'm gonna be here having fun.
"Brennan: Incredible. Okay. Amazing, so, and obviously, these days of work, you're still going out into the station to get stuff and do stuff. Let me know what you guys are doing on the station. Obviously, Margaret, you're the one who made the call to come here, so maybe we start with you. What is it you wanna do at the station?"
"Ally: I have to take care of a couple of things. I think I'm gonna talk to UFTP people, really seem completely normal, like I'm just at work. Oh, this is, you know, my personal vessel that I live on, we're taking care of it."
Brennan: Give me an investigation check and then also give me a persuasion check for doing your job.
"Ally: Okay, great. Investigation."
Lou: Full miss.
Ally: Full miss.
Lou: Full miss.
Ally: Is a 13.
"Brennan: 13, okay."
Ally: What was the other one?
Brennan: Persuasion.
"Ally: Oh, great. That one is good. Where is she? Oh. 23."
"Brennan: 23\. You are talking to an old pal of yours on the station. As you guys, whoosh, the Red Hot comes in. Lands, you're in outer space. So the docking port comes in, you don't have to engage landing gear, you're in zero grav, but space station creates the grav, you come out on this long hallway. As the hallway opens up you see a couple of UFTP security and an old buddy of yours. You see he's got bright, shining white teeth, two cybernetic eyes. This is Higgs who is an android who is an executive assistant android to the person who runs the station. But you see Higgs walks up and goes,"
"Higgs: ah! Margaret, pleasure to see you."
"Margaret: Higgs, how are you?"
"Higgs: Fine, fine, fine."
"Margaret: Can I use my high persuasion to kind of, everything’s going, just to smooth this over and just-"
"Higgs: Yeah. Let me ask, what brings you to Madrugada Station?"
"Margaret: Oh, well I have to do a little bit of work that's all gonna be remote and we were nearby so we had a couple of repairs that need to be done on our vessel."
"Higgs: Amazing, happy to hear it."
"Brennan: Moves around, you see, Sid, this android kind of clocks you for a moment as well, sees your get up."
Emily: Can I speak to the android via our...
"Brennan: Yeah, you can open a channel."
"Emily: I open a channel and I say,"
"Sidney: hey, how are you?"
"Higgs: Oh, I'm quite alright, I'm doing what I'm supposed to."
Sidney: Okay. Have you ever wondered if maybe there's a benefit to doing what you wanna do? If maybe there is an advantage to it?
"Brennan: He says,"
Higgs: I can show you what gives me a feeling of doing what I want to do.
Brennan: And he opens his whole channel to you and you feel thousands of other androids of his line.
Sidney: How do you do that? 'Cause I've looked for other androids in my line.
"Brennan: He in this channel, he's not broken eye contact with you, Margaret, he's still talking, but you just hear through this telepathic channel, he gives you his designation number which is five digits long. And he opens you and you see Sundry Sidney, model amount, one serial number 001, beep."
Sidney: Does that mean I'm the first or does that mean I'm the only?
Higgs: Both.
"Sidney: Okay. Okay, that's a lot to process, which is what we both do. Because I've known many humans who desire individuality but as an android, I have only ever sought to lose myself in my line."
"Brennan: You see, in that channel, he says,"
Higgs: I do not know why you are the only of your line. Great sorrow and great tragedy comes with being the keeper of souls.
"Sidney: What does that mean, keeper of souls?"
"Higgs: Of your line, you are the only one. There could be many. There could be many."
"Sidney: So I'm the patent? And if they scrap me, then Sundry Sidney is gone forever?"
Emily: I look at Margaret so haunted. Even though she can hear none of this. And I hold hands with Margaret.
"Margaret: Yeah, so anyway, I was just gonna touch base with a couple of people."
Zac: Is this your gun arm?
"Ally: Yeah, I'm just holding the gun."
Brennan: Holding the gun.
Sidney: Please hold my gun.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see he looks at you and says,"
Higgs: I'm sure you've heard some rumbling of trouble over on the moon.
"Margaret: I definitely have. Working so close with all of the leadership, I'm sure you've heard of a number of promotions that have been going around. Yeah, I did hear about that. What is going on there?"
"Brennan: He says,"
"Higgs: monarch feels like they got a bad deal, what can I say?"
Margaret: Are there people that are pro-monarchy?
Higgs: Well-
Margaret: 'Cause they could ruin us.
Ally: I try to really like...
Brennan: Yeah. Give me a persuasion roll. Actually you've already got a 20?
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see Higgs looks at you and says,"
"Higgs: you think so? Have you run the numbers on their military and what it would...sorta cost-benefit? Entire moon made of lithium, that's a lot of McCoy."
"Margaret: Yeah, I guess I'm thinking with my heart and not my brain. (laughs) It happens to the best of us!"
"Higgs: It's all the same. I don't have a brain, I have krystals. (laughs)"
"Margaret: Definitely. Definitely, my man."
Higgs: If you had to rate this interaction on a scale of 1 to 10.
Margaret: 10!
Higgs: Amazing.
"Margaret: Absolute 10,"
Ally: I fill out a little form.
"Higgs: Oh, incredible!"
Margaret: You are a joy as always.
"Higgs: Oh, thank you."
"Ally: There are a couple of things I wanna do here and I think, can I roll or something? 'Cause I would love to find someone who is in touch with what's going on with the people of the moon."
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. You go to do that, for everyone else, as Margaret heads off with Higgs, what are the rest of you-"
"Ally: Oh wait, I don't wanna be with Higgs. I don't need anyone from UFTP to know that I'm actually trying to find this out."
Brennan: So you just wanna go secretly find out some stuff going on with what's happening on moonside?
Murph: We are kind of looking for jobs and stuff if you wanna-
"Ally: Yeah, maybe we all stick together but that's just what I'm hoping to accomplish. I wanna hear the human side of this. And then I think I also wanna… It feels like my ass is kind of covered with work and stuff hopefully."
Brennan: Yeah!
"Ally: I think I wanna go back on that Reddit and from the same user, just scroll through and find like the fucking hottest nude that I have that's neck down and just post that from the same user."
Brennan: You... (laughs)
Ally: I just want her to know that I know she's looking and move on with my damn life.
"Brennan: You immediately get a lot of comments on that. Basically saying like, hi, question, you asked for a revolution to occur and there were a lot of questions we had about sort of what you meant-"
"Ally: I'm not reading the comments, I'm not reading the comments."
"Brennan: And the timeline on that, and your follow-up was to post this. Are we to understand that this is you? Is this an encrypted message?"
Emily: Can I cast Off on Margaret's phone?
"Ally: You saw it over my shoulder, I was picking which of very similar nudes to post."
"Sidney: Okay, I'm getting into impulsivity but no."
"Brennan: Incredible. So you post that. Yeah, Margaret is sort of unraveling."
"Ally: Lucy needs to see, alright? We've had enough out of her."
"Brennan: For everybody else, what are we doing on the station?"
"Siobhan: Well, so obviously, because I'm an aquatic creature, I personally cannot go onto the station, but I do have basically a droid that I can puppet, like a construct that I can psychically puppet."
Brennan: You have a psychodrone.
"Siobhan: Psychodrone. So I have a Pleasure Putty tote bag, messenger bag, that I fill to the brim with both samples and leaflets."
Ally: Wow!
"Siobhan: And I'm a very empathic person, I think I'm just gonna go in and find who I feel like would be open to being their own boss."
"Brennan: Alright, we're scrounging up some Pleasure Putty credits here, is anyone else hitting the station looking for work or money or pleasure?"
Gunnie: I'll come with whoever's looking for work.
Barry Syx: I'm looking for a contract.
"Sidney: I'm looking for work, but I'm also deeply distracted."
"Brennan: Yeah. Okay, you're deeply distracted, you know what you're doing. What's Skip up to?"
"Zac: I think Skip is just practicing talking and stuff and moving around. It's still very puppety looking and, I mean sure. I feel like-"
"Brennan: I'm gonna say that Skipper, Barry and Gunnie, 'cause you need to go get supplies and stuff. So you head to a nearby spot, it's around the corner from where you're getting supplies filled out. So you all head to this place called The Drone's Throne which is basically just a drinking hole near the spaceport. You're going into some places away from prying eyes to go look for what you're looking for. Let's go ahead and have you roll a, I would like a profession check here. Let's go ahead and roll a persuasion check."
Siobhan: A nine.
"Brennan: Okay. So this psychodrone, it's this yellow crash dummy looking robot walking around with a tote bag. And you see that there is basically just a guy on a street corner. You see he's got a weird little silver alloy cap and he's spinning a sign to a nearby sandwich shop. Hey."
Riva: Cool spinning!
"Sandwich: Yeah, you want a sandwich?"
"Riva: No, I don't. Are you interested in being your own boss?"
Sandwich: Okay. Sure.
Ally: Are they gonna do it?
"Riva: Oh, okay."
"Sandwich: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Riva: Well here, Pleasure Putty is a way for you to be your own boss. And-"
Emily: I think he's kind of hot.
Ally: Hot or high?
Emily: Hot!
"Riva: So, what you do is you just sign up here and then I give you a starter pack to be a Pleasure Putty salesperson, as your own boss. And then any commission that you make, I, as my own boss, make some cut of it and then I give some of that to the person who's above but also below me on this pyramid that moves around where everybody is their own bosses."
Sandwich: You a real robot?
"Riva: No. No, I'm not a robot."
Sandwich: You look like a robot.
"Riva: I'm not. Humans often call me a fish person, but that's actually quite inaccurate because I'm not a fish at all. We're not fish, it's a different thing."
"Sandwich: But you're a real person, you're bio?"
Riva: Yeah.
Sandwich: Got a mouth?
Ally: Oh my God!
"Riva: Yeah, I got a mouth."
"Ally: Wow, you thought he was so hot, wow."
Emily: I officially change my mind.
"Sandwich: You got a mouth, you got a butthole?"
"Riva: Well actually, it's a complicated, it's different from what humans would call a butthole because it's just a general waste excretion hole."
Sandwich: Cloaca?
"Riva: No, that would be on Earth birds and fish. And again, I'm not a fish."
Sandwich: The point is this- You can eat sandwiches.
"Riva: Well, actually..."
"Lou: Wow, that flipped."
Ally: Now is he hot again? Now is he hot again?
"Emily: If he works at a deli, he's hot."
Ally: Your mouth and your butthole are connected through a series of tubes and a sandwich would navigate that so maybe he's brilliant.
"Lou: It's not a sex thing, it's a sandwich thing."
Emily: You need a butthole to get rid of it.
Sandwich: I'll tell you what. How much for a Putty Pack?
"Riva: Oh, it is 30 credits for a basic pack."
Sandwich: Okay.
"Riva: But, if you want to sign up, you give me the 30 credits to sign up but then technically the Putty Pack is free."
Sandwich: Yeah. Okay. Go get 10 sandwiches.
Riva: I actually don't need any sandwiches.
"Sandwich: Go get 10 sandwiches, come back. You see, he by the way, has not exhaled. It's just he keeps inhaling from this cigarette and says, go get 10 sandwiches, I'll sign up."
Riva: How much does a sandwich cost?
Sandwich: Two qua-credits.
Riva: What's a qua-credit?
Sandwich: A qua-credit?
"Riva: Yes, is that different from a credit?"
Sandwich: A qua-credit is a quarter of a credit. So it's two qua-credits is half a credit so five credits gets you 10 sandwiches.
"Riva: And then you'll pay me 30 credits? Well, that's a bargain, absolutely I'll go and get some sandwiches!"
"Brennan: Amazing. So, on that nine persuasion, you come back with a bag of 10 sandwiches, that guy is gone, fully gone."
Lou: We're gonna go find that guy.
Emily: He does work at the deli!
"Brennan: Yeah, Riva, you go, but you have 10 delicious sandwiches."
"Riva: Well, I can't eat these sandwiches but maybe my crewmates like them. And that guy will probably come back so I'll just wait for him."
Ally: Oh!
"Brennan: Oh, no!"
Lou: Just a yellow droid standing on a street corner with a bag full of sex jelly and 10 sandwiches.
Siobhan: Sex putty.
"Brennan: Sex putty. Incredible. Skipper, Barry, and Gunnie, you guys arrive at the Drone's Throne. This is a fine drinking establishment here by the spaceport. Go ahead and make any rolls you wanna make in terms of looking for work."
"Emily: Can I actually go with them? But I'm despondent so I just sit at the bar. But 'cause I have my background features, I know mercenaries, I can identify their companies including names and reputations and commanders and leaders. So basically can I go there to be pointing out who they should talk to?"
"Brennan: Absolutely, yes, yes, yes. So you go there pointing out who all of them should talk to."
"Gunnie: First of all, guys, drinks are on me, alright?"
"Barry Syx: Well, they're on Marge."
"Gunnie: Yeah. No, no. I was tutoring last night, I made 20 credits and drinks are on me today. 'Cause I feel like things are turning around, Skip."
Skip: Right on.
"Barry Syx: Right on, right on!"
"Gunnie: That's just great! So I just, I just want, you know. This is the beginning of something. And it's real good. And I know it's all turning around. This is how it starts. This is how it starts."
Barry Syx: This is momentum. This is the ball starting to roll.
Gunnie: This is momentum! Yeah!
"Barry Syx: Up the hill, yes!"
"Gunnie: Okay. Bartender. Give me four? Yeah, four."
"Barry Syx: Sid, you alright?"
"Gunnie: Yeah, Sid, did you want any? You were quiet that whole time."
Sidney: I'm the only in my line.
Murph: Yeah. Barry gets devastatingly depressed.
"Sidney: If I go, Sundry Sidney's no longer."
"Barry Syx: If anything happens to Barry Syx, that's the end of the Barry Battalion."
Sidney: So make it eight drinks.
Skip: My name is Norman Takamori.
"Barry Syx: Damn right it is, Skip."
"Gunnie: I don't know if I have enough for eight. We'll just get eight. We'll get eight. It's fine! This is where, the ball is rolling up the hill. Eight drinks for me and my friends."
Brennan: Eight-
Skip: Make it 12.
Gunnie: The ball is going up!
"Sidney: I don't know the reason why, but right on."
"Brennan: Alright, go ahead and throw down 10 credits."
"Sidney: Right on, 12 drinks."
"Gunnie: Okay, half of my side money, okay!"
"Brennan: Round of drinks lands in front of you. Yeah. I'm gonna say for those of you here, go ahead and give me a group persuasion check."
"Murph: Okay, does anyone have good persuasion that I can help?"
Lou: I only get a plus three.
"Emily: No, I got a plus one."
"Murph: Alright, I got a plus two so."
"Zac: Negative one, so."
Siobhan: If only I was here.
Lou: Nat one.
Emily: Seven.
Murph: 15.
Zac: 10.
"Brennan: Okay. So you guys clear a 10, so you guys buy more drinks than you can drink, slam a bunch of them. You point, there's a guy over in the corner who looks like he's sort of holding court at this little corner booth that you are all welcome to approach if you want."
Sidney: Him.
Gunnie: You think he's the guy?
"Barry Syx: Alright, we all going or what?"
Sidney: Him. I'm gonna watch from afar in case anything happens.
"Gunnie: We got this, come on, guys. Ball's rolling up the hill now!"
Barry Syx: And yet life is so precious. There's only one Barry and one Sid left.
Emily: Can I just like do a really desperate arm squeeze on your mech suit and cast Enhance Android so that you have advantage on charisma checks?
Lou: Ooh. Gunnie is feeling himself.
Brennan: Amazing.
"Lou: My eyes shine just a little bit brighter and I'm like,"
Gunnie: let's go handle this.
"Barry Syx: I'm a little rocked at the moment, Gunnie, so I'll just follow you."
Zac: Hand you one more drink.
"Brennan: Okay, so here's what happens. A clone falling into a hole of grief in himself, a brain slug, and Gunnie really feeling himself walk up to this dangerous looking older proldier in the corner who looks up."
"Stranger: How's it going, stranger?"
"Gunnie: Buddy, I can't even begin to tell ya. The ball is rolling up the hill! And we're wondering if you were, if you… We're wondering… We're wondering if you wanna be a part of the roll in that you know someone, (chair clattering) sorry, you know someone who needs help from some real hot guns."
"Brennan: Now, you've been granted advantage."
(all laughing)
"But you already rolled a nat one. So we're gonna roll the second advantage die, but you're going to actually roll it with disadvantage. So you're gonna roll two D20."
Murph: You did so bad you got disadvantage!
"Brennan: So roll disadvantage for me, this is a persuasion check."
Emily: I believe.
Lou: Great.
Emily: I know I'm powerful.
Lou: First one's an eight.
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: Second one's a 17. So the eight is an 11.
"Brennan: The eight is an 11, gotcha. Okay."
Lou: I don't know why I said it that way. I got an 11.
"Brennan: You got an 11, copy that. So you see, he looks and says,"
"Stranger: oh, you're looking for help. Or you think I'm looking for help?"
Gunnie: Or someone you know.
"Stranger: Oh, okay. Well I might be looking for help. What's the classification on your ship?"
Gunnie: Freighter. Type II.
Sidney: Oh my God.
"Stranger: Wow. Okay, what's the call sign on that freighter you got there, hoss?"
Lou: What is the call sign?
Brennan: The Red Hot.
Gunnie: Docked earlier today. It's called the Red Hot. Big old hot dog looking thing.
"Emily: Can I Minor Hologram him to, I can create an odor, can I have him smell like expensive perfume?"
Ally: Perfume!
"Brennan: Okay, so Sidney, you rollerskate over."
(all laughing)
"Ally: Just, lilacs fill the air, jasmine."
"Murph: Laughter didn't come out, I just exploded. What?"
"Emily: I can do it from 10, (laughs) I can do it from 10 feet."
Murph: What?
Brennan: You can do it from how many feet? How many feet away?
Emily: 10 feet.
"Brennan: Okay, so you rollerskate to 10 feet behind Gunnie and blast a small missile. And a explosion of lilac scented smoke, boof, covers Gunnie."
"(Zac gasping, retching)"
(Lou coughing)
"Emily: But distinctly expensive. (Zac gasping loudly) It's distinctively expensive, someone would know."
Brennan: Incredibly expensive perfume comes blasting out of your android body.
"Murph: Barry can sense, Barry's not a super smart guy, but the Barrys were cool so he senses that this is going really wrong. So he throws his sunglasses on, he goes,"
"Barry Syx: sorry about that. I just ripped ass. My farts smell awesome. 'Cause we fucking rule and we kick ass. My name's Barry Syx, I'm from the Barry Battalion, alright? Only thing that could take us out was a trip to the zoo."
Gunnie: And he's not lying. He's not lying.
Barry Syx: Before that we fucking kicked ass and guess what? We didn't take names 'cause we didn't ask 'em. Have you got any contracts on the more expensive side? We're happy to take them off your hands.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me, I guess intimidate? Give me an intimidate with disadvantage."
Emily: He gets to roll with advantage.
"Murph: Okay, intimidation, I have a plus four."
"Zac: Skip heard that he said his name so he walks forward and goes,"
Skip: my name is Norman Takamori.
Gunnie: It is!
"Brennan: Okay, this is gonna be at disadvantage, give me intimidation."
Murph: No!
"Brennan: Yeah, 100%."
"Murph: Oh my God. Okay, lower one is a 10, so 14."
"Brennan: 14\. The guy looks up at you. We are all weeping at the table right now. He looks up at you and says,"
"Stranger: Barry Battalion, huh?"
Barry Syx: Right on.
"Stranger: Last I heard, not too many of you left."
Barry Syx: Just me and Barry Nine.
"Stranger: Hmm. Just you and Barry Nine. Well, if you're interested in contracts, I should tell you about an interesting contract."
Gunnie: Now we're talking.
Emily: I lurk to hear so that we're all here.
"Brennan: He says,"
Stranger: it's the one I took earlier today.
Gunnie: Okay.
"Stranger: Captain De La Vega, we got them."
(all gasping)
Brennan: We're gonna cut from there to Margaret!
(all laughing)
Emily: Was that the stupidest thing we've ever done?
"Lou: Sorry, I ripped ass. That's up there, I think that's up there."
Zac: Only a zoo?
Brennan: Only a zoo! Oh my God! (laughs)
"Ally: Brennan, the way that you play along with us while deciding how exactly you're gonna punish our deep folly..."
"Brennan: Perfect, it's perfect. Margaret, you said you wanted to get away from UFTP and do some actual research yourself. What kind of research are you trying to do on this UFTP satellite station?"
"Ally: Okay, so I don't know, I guess I just-"
"Siobhan: I'm sorry, I'm not looking."
Brennan: A squad of four people and the best anyone's got to persuasion is a plus two!
Murph : (nearly incoherent with laughter) I'm just imagining your friend about to get into a fight and just spritzing him! (laughs)
(all laughing)
"Brennan: Ooh, ooh."
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: Okay. Amazing.
Lou: Amazing.
Ally: 10 feet away is a really funny amount away. It's very visible.
"Brennan: Very visible. It's like from me to Murph right now is about 10 feet, to blast someone. So, Margaret, you say you're looking for moonside information, you're looking for information about the monarchy, right?"
"Ally: Yeah. I mean, is it as cut and dry as these people are sitting on a lot more worth, they've been tricked by this company, companies are evil? Is it just like?"
"Brennan: Well, so it's a complicated thing, right? Obviously this is a monarchy, which is not the most progressive governmental system in the world, but it is the monarchy of this moon that was bought by UFTP you know, maybe 40 or 50 cycles back. So it's a question of basically, effectively what happened was this monarchy came about as a noble house on the moon that rose to a position of a moon-wide monarchy due to the backing of United Free Trade Planets. They basically rolled in and said, hey, we'll fund your overthrow of your rival houses if you grant us some mining permits, not a big deal, ba ba ba ba ba. And basically the monarchies had a couple dozen cycles to figure out that was an incredibly bad deal and that UFTP is hollowing out their moon as rapidly as possible. So it's complicated, but not that complicated. Their world is being hollowed out by the company."
"Ally: Okay. I think I just wanna talk to, I wanna try to find someone cool that is in the know and that I can maybe keep in contact with if I need to, I don't know."
Brennan: Go ahead and make an investigation check for me.
Ally: Okay. 12.
(dramatic electronic music)
"Brennan: 12, okay. You are not able to find a premium ally moonside, but on 12 investigation, I will say this. You do get some intel that a member of the royal house of Rubian V did recently basically go MIA from moonside. One of the children of the current monarch, the Princeps Zorch. Now, the reason this catches your eye is that that obviously, the monarch has several offspring. Zorch headed out and you're not able to find any place that they may have gone to except for tracking down a docking signature at a rec station for a Rubian V craft in the right timeframe. So there's a couple of things, it's not a sure-fire thing, but it's like, okay, if you filter out enough stuff, Rubian V's not a huge homeworld with tons of stuff, there's not that many craft with this planetary designation out there around. So that's probably gotta be the Princeps' vessel. And you look through that and see that there is a deluxe hotel that there was a reservation at, with the name Madeline Maud. Madeline Maud, which you see is attached to the credit account of the ship, which is how you're able to find it. The name Madeline Maud is a name you recognize. Madeline Maud, high-level UFTP executives, much like celebrities, often don't use their real names when they're checking in. Madeline Maud was the name the first time you and Lucienne stayed in hotels for a business conference. And Lucienne told you if you wanna come hang out in my room later, I'm at the hotel under Madeline Maud."
"Ally: Okay. Fuck. Ooh! Evil. Okay, I guess I wanna go back to the group and maybe try to get to that hotel."
Brennan: Amazing. The hotel is at one of the galaxy's most wild and debauched rec stations known.
Ally: We will fit right in. (laughs)
Brennan: You go to find your crew. Do you try to hit them up on a transponder or something like that?
"Ally: Yeah, I think so."
"Brennan: Amazing. So you try to hit them up. As you walk away, the destination for that hotel reservation is Rec 97. You hit up the transmitter, what do you say in your message to everybody?"
"Margaret: Hey, I'm probably getting ready to head to the next spot. How are the repairs going?"
Zac: Are we alive?
Emily: I don't know.
Brennan: We cut back to all of you. What do you do after this proldier in the corner says this?
Murph: I guess do we have a communicator thing?
"Brennan: Yeah, you do."
"Barry Syx: Everybody get to the bar, this guy just made fun of the Barrys!"
Murph: And I go to fucking deck him.
Brennan: Amazing. Go ahead and make an attack roll.
Emily: Does he have a weapon on him?
"Murph: I have, my fists are decent."
"Emily: No, no, no, the guy that we're talking to."
"Brennan: Oh yeah, he does, yeah, for sure."
Murph: I'm just gonna fucking deck this dude.
"Ally: Oh, for sure."
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure."
"Murph: Oh, sweet, 22."
"Brennan: That hits, go ahead and what's your unarmed damage?"
Murph: D6 plus my strength.
Brennan: Incredible.
Murph: Seven damage.
"Brennan: Seven damage, wham! You hit this guy right in the chin. He goes back, on his transponder you see Captain De La Vega come up. The captain of the Lady Pike. Who looks at all you and says,"
"De la Vega: well, well, well, I bet y'all had a big laugh sending me 14 crates of powdered imitation egg substitute, didn't ya?"
"Barry Syx: Yeah, it was hilarious."
"De la Vega: Well, I want you to know something, my friend here took up my signal. Lady Pike's on a Tachyon Drive right now, we're heading right to Rubian, babies. So I'll get you in my sights real fast now. Nobody makes a fool of Jan De La Vega. Ain't that right, Needles?"
Needles: Yeah! I'm gonna murder all youse guys!
"Brennan: Oh, the guy also says,"
Stranger: I don't like that you hit me either.
Brennan: And you see he takes a swing at you. And fully misses.
Murph: Can I take an off-hand attack and hit him two more times?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
Murph: 18 to hit on my off-hand.
"Brennan: Go for it, roll damage."
Murph: Six that time.
Zac: Can I just try to punch him in the face too?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
Emily: I wanna punch him too.
"Zac: I don't know what I add to just a flat punch, unarmed strike, what is that? I rolled a 13."
Brennan: You would add strength plus proficiency.
Zac: Okay. So 15.
Brennan: 15 does hit absolutely.
"Zac: So I'm just gonna, I think it's a D4?"
"Brennan: Yeah, but you also add your sneak attack."
Zac: Oh my God.
"Murph: Oh my God, dude!"
"Brennan: And Sid, you take an attack too if you want."
"Emily: Yeah, I got a 17."
Brennan: 17 hits.
Zac: Eight damage.
"Brennan: Eight damage, Jesus."
"Emily: You know what? Bonus action Target Lock. And then I'm gonna go ahead and use a kinetic die. Not great, but."
Zac: Is this guy still sitting down?
Brennan: (laughs) Yeah!
Emily: 10.
"Brennan: 10? So this guy had a scary moment where he was like, Captain De La Vega, I got 'em. The whole bar turns to see you just rollerskate kicking this guy in the head. You're just wailing on this dude. Fully unconscious in his seat, bam, bam, bam!"
Emily: Rollerskate wheels on teeth.
Brennan: Incredible.
Lou: Can I grab the transponder?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Lou: Great. Is she still there?
"Brennan: Yeah, Captain De La Vega's still there."
"Gunnie: Hey, so we didn't know either. So it wasn't a trick on you, there was no tricking."
De la Vega: It was a dirty trick.
Gunnie: It was not. There was no tricking.
"De la Vega: Let me tell you something right here. Tricksters get trucked, okay? That's-"
"Zac: I'm gonna grab the transponder and look at it and say,"
Skip: my name is Norman Takamori.
"Barry Syx: That's right, Skip."
Zac: I hand it to you.
"Barry Syx: Alright. Listen up. The Barry Battalion, no, sorry. The Gunner Channel is coming for you. So don't talk to me about you coming for me 'cause you can't come for me 'cause we're already coming for you. We already took out this guy, it was easy as hell. He sucked. He said a fucking mean thing and then we just beat the shit out of him. And that's what we're gonna do to you when you show up, asshole!"
Murph: And then I hand it back to Gunnie.
"De la Vega: So what sort of a message here, you're saying\-"
(laughs)
(device beeping)
"Brennan: You end it. You end it. Margaret comes on the transponder, also Riva. You guys see Riva comes in on the psychodrone, just on a street corner with a bag of sandwiches."
"Riva: Hi, I've got sandwiches, I am waiting on someone."
(Skip makes a gurgling sound)
"Margaret: We gotta go, guys, let's get in!"
"Lou: Wait, how many Maltons do we have before they got here?"
Brennan: They could be here at any second.
"Gunnie: Oh, yeah, yeah, let's go."
"Margaret: Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
Murph: If this guy has any money we should take his money.
Emily: Can I disarm him and take his gun?
"Brennan: Yes, you absolutely can, you grab a light blaster pistol and you head on out of here with a still badly damaged ship. Nothing happened!"
"Ally: Wait, we didn't fix it at all?"
"Brennan: No, you got into a fight within minutes of getting on the station! You head into faster-than-light travel, headed for Rec 97 and you are gone, that is it for this episode of ""Dimension 20!"""
Lou: We're gonna figure out how to do something. We're gonna figure it out.

"Brennan: Hello one and all, welcome back to another thrilling episode of ""Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey."" I'm your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan, with me, as always, are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes."
"Brennan: Last we left off, our intrepid heroes were limping out of Madrugada Station, a sort of mining town encampment for United Free Trade Planets. Getting the hell out of dodge once more with a ship with no shields, blasted to bits, not refueled, after a run-in with a double-crossing proldier who alerted that old shark of the system Jan de la Vega, captain of the Lady Pike, that you had made your way here, but let's zoom out for a second. You're on a ship that's been blasted to bits. You have a huge problem, it would seem, in that some kind of cerebro-slug has blasted its way into the brain stem of your captain, Norman ""The Skipper"" Takamori."
Lou: Not a problem. Problem's a strong-
Siobhan: Seems normal.
Ally: I like him.
"Brennan: Actually it seems that having been brain-slugged is something of an improvement to our dear skipper and has allowed the intercession both emotionally and financially, of Margaret Encino, who, having a bit of a quarter life crisis–"
Ally laughs.
"Emily: I see in my notes ""Margaret's daddy."""
Ally: [laughing] Yeah.
Cast laughs.
"Brennan: Yes, the events of the last episode saw the new consciousness of whatever invertebrate now inhabits the host body of the Red Hot captain and pilot, as well as some realizations about the nature of this corporate galaxy from Margaret Encino. Indeed, it is a tough galaxy out there and especially when people who promised to always have your back, get married to the, kind of, ruling family of Crown and Scepter Limited, the holding- or the parent company of UFTP."
Ally: Yeah I'm pretty mad at my friend.
"Brennan: Pretty mad at your ""friend."""
"Zac: [simultaneously with Brennan] ""Friend""."
Emily laughs.
"Ally: [raising their voice] Okay, everybody, cool it."
Brennan: Pretty mad at your [putting weight on the next word] friend about that...
"Ally: My dear friend, historically."
"Brennan: So you chose during last week's episode to roll by this sort of hovering space station over Rubian V, the lithium moon surrounding the gas giant, Rubian, to hear some rumblings of revolution against United Free Trade Planets from the Monarch of Rubian V, and found out that the Princeps, their eldest child of Rubian V, had absconded. Last we left off, Margaret had collected the information that a signature of a ship designated from Rubian V had appeared at the infamous Rec 97. Rec 97, one of the hundreds of recreation stations floating out in the galaxy. Now the galaxy here in AnarchEra is pretty lawless by definition. You're living in AnarchEra, proldiers abound, various factions vie for power in the power vacuum, post overthrow of the Incorporated Elysian Republic. However there's lawlessness, and then there's law-less-ness and the various recreation stations that populate galactic space, boy howdy do some wild shenanigans go down on those Rec Stations floating in space. Discovering that the signature of perhaps the Princeps' ship had absconded to Rec 97 and finding the ship's accounts attached to the name Madeline Maud, a name of some personal significance to Margaret Encino as it was the pseudonym for Lucienne Rex, your old [putting weight on that last word] friend."
Siobhan: [echoing Brennan] Friend.
"Ally: [defensive] Yes, my friend. I know what she checks into hotels under."
Cast laughs.
Zac: [while shrugging] Just friend stuff.
Lou: Classic friend stuff.
"Ally: Best friends send each other a key card and a secret name to check in under, okay? [laughs]"
"Brennan: Exactly! So daddy Margaret dropped 3,200- [cast laughs] 3,200 credits on the beleaguered Red Hot, which for all of you is probably the biggest score in a long, long time."
Emily: The ball is rolling up. [laughs]
Brennan: The ball-
"Lou: [grateful] The ball, oh. [inaudible]"
Ally: The ball is rolling up the hill.
Siobhan: Going up the hill.
Lou: [pointing at the sky] This is it! Our luck is changing!
Everyone points at the sky. Zach blows kisses at the sky.
"Brennan: Let's see if we can find some luck in those stars, gang, the ball's rolling uphill and the Red Hot rolls out of faster-than-light speed. [whooshing and warping sounds] The Red Hot emerges, the tachyon drive slows and the krystal reactor core of the Red Hot takes over as we enter real space once again. [Sci-Fi sound] Ahead of you, larger than some moons, is Recreation Station 97. There are hundreds of layers, the sort of mining encampment that you just came from, Madrugada station, which is all sorts of chrome and steel and very nuts and bolts, is dwarfed. This Rec station doesn't have any problem generating its own gravity. Like, it needs to do very little to actually create its own artificial gravity. It is also stunning. Metallic emerald sheen metal creates this bright green neon pulsating, even through the void of space, you just get the vibe of loud music playing. On the upper levels, you see the dome and the Blue Heaven level of the real movers and shakers of the Rec Station. There is some real galactic, sort of, honchos here at Rec 97 and you see various middle levels of the Rec Station with casinos and nightclubs and bars and restaurants and all sorts of places where galactic tourists can come and avail themselves of the amenities of this interstellar hub and then down below, you see as many of the lower levels of the Rec Station filled with various and sundry seedy opportunities and the sort of waste and industrial compartmentalization and management for all the stuff that goes on here. As the Red Hot approaches, truly the mass of the Rec station begins to eclipse your horizon to the point where you can no longer actually see all of the Rec Station at the same time. Red Hot comes in and you begin to pull into an available dock. You actually hear, coming in [Brennan puts his fingers against his ear, as if pushing against an earpiece]"
[Intercom beeps]
"Rec 97 docking agent: [distorted, as if through a speaker] We're clocking the Red Hot coming in. Looking for docking, refueling, repairs?"
[Intercom beeps]
"Skip: [looks around hesitantly, then says somewhat confidently] Yes."
[Intercom beeps]
"Rec 97 docking agent: Copy that. You're gonna head to Level 7, Vale of Tiers."
"Brennan: And you head to the Vale of Tiers, which are a section of extremely debauched tiers of the Rec Station, right smack dab in the middle."
"Emily: Oh, T-I-E-R-S."
Brennan: T-I-E-R-S.
"Ally: And I was like, wow where are we going with this, Brennan? [laughs]"
"Brennan: You pull into this docking station and you begin to hear some shouts from outside. Immediately work has already commenced while some of the dock workers have started to, you know, get-"
Lou: Get on our ship?
"Brennan: -on your ship. Like, putting-"
"Emily: [with extreme relief] Oh, thank you."
"Ally: Yeah, truly."
Riva: This time it will definitely work.
"Sidney: Can I actually make a suggestion? I think we should- Margaret, this would be obviously if it was okay with you, I know that currently our escape pod is your apartment, so it's like nonfunctional as an escape pod, but given what just happened to our ship, I was wondering if maybe we might wanna have an escape pod."
"Margaret: I agree, I think I should move into the captain's quarters."
[crosstalks in agreement] [Sidney claps]
Skip: Right on.
"Margaret: Yeah, definitely cool."
"Sidney: You know, captain's quarters means I'll meet you every single morning with exactly your beverage of preference."
"Margaret: Incredible. Yes, okay, great."
"Ally: So yeah, the captain's quarters are huge, right? It's like gorgeous."
Brennan: Enormous. Incredibly well appointed.
"Ally: Oh, yeah, yeah, incredible."
Margaret: I completely agree we should definitely have an escape pod.
Zac: Skip's gonna take the book of carpet samples and walk into the escape pod.
Cast laughs.
"Brennan: Incredible. Margaret, you walk into the captain's quarters, again, very well appointed, although not necessarily your style, but, you know, you're at Rec 97. You can get this thing taken care of if you wanted to, appoint it a little bit differently."
"Sidney: Again, any interior design, I can be your point person on that."
Margaret: Incredible.
Sidney: I don't see colors.
"Margaret: Okay, then I'll help with that part."
"Riva: I see about 18 different colors than you see, but I don't see any red. That's a much lower spectrum of color."
"Sidney: Wow, the battlefield must seem very tame to you."
"Riva: What is-? Oh, interesting."
Cast laughs.
"Brennan: Margaret, you walk into the captain's quarters. Well, actually, you tell me, how is Margaret feeling walking into the captain's quarters of a hot dog shaped ship? Where is your life at right now, as you pull into Rec 97?"
"Ally: I mean, great question. I have a lot of questions in my mind. Definitely wondering if I'm making the right choice or if I'm swinging too… I feel like I'm a person of extremes. So I, when I'm very extremely into a business job and I'm kind of like, I'm getting older, am I really just leaving all of that behind and going psycho in this direction?"
Brennan: Give me an investigation check.
"Ally: Okay, great. [rolls a dice, clears throat after looking at the number] It's a nine."
"Brennan: You, uh, begin to interrogate yourself and your choices. [persuasively] Listen, you're just keeping your options open."
Margaret: Exactly...
"Brennan: [still persuasively] You haven't left United Free Trade, you haven't left. You're a one woman department."
"Margaret: You're right, there's no one... knows."
"Brennan: [still persuasively] You're- And if you choose to make an investment in a, you know, sort of potentially profitable shipping business."
"Margaret: [with too much force, as if trying to convince oneself] This is just an investment."
Brennan: [excitedly] It's an investment!
"Margaret: [convinced] This is an investment and I'm moving- This is actually kind of a nice room. [pointing] Take down that wall, hum... Don't have this wall be all mirrors."
Cast laughs.
"Brennan: As you sort of go in here, by the way, you do find a lot of the captain's paperwork. You find a lot of Skip's papers in here. You see that there's some really unhinged, electro correspondence about, like, refusing to join any proldiers' unions, or any- Like you see that basically the reason that the crews also has like not been getting any jobs is just how antagonistic the old captain was towards like the U4F or even, like, sort of old former brigadier things. So you're not like- other than, like, rolling up in strange bars, you're not sure how this group has been getting jobs in the past."
Ally: Can I-?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Ally: Can I really just hone in and use- instead of working for work today, just do a, like overhaul of the ship and how we do business?"
"Brennan: Oh my God. Yes, 100%."
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: So, we're gonna come back to that in a second, absolutely. Rest of the crew-"
Emily: I'm just shuttling you matchas.
"Ally: I'm just like, thank you. [typing wildly on a computer] Ahh-kah-kah-kah- kah"
"Brennan: So for everyone else, what are you doing as the Red Hot pulls into the dock?"
Murph: Do we have a sense of when we're gonna get caught by the person who's pursuing us?
"Emily: Yeah, by..."
Lou: De La Vega.
Brennan: Did you guys jump FTL?
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: If you jumped FTL, there is almost no way for her to track you here. So she would need to spend multiple marbecs, if not multiple malton units, like at Madrugada trying to see if anybody else could find out where you had headed off to."
"Siobhan: Now here's a question about legality. Since we are living in an anarchic time, can we just [tentatively] change the name of the ship?"
"Brennan: You- Oh! So, here's the thing-"
Emily: Can we make it look like a bratwurst instead?
Brennan: I will say this right now.
Cast crosstalks excitedly.
Zac: Sausage baguette.
Cast laughs.
"Brennan: So, you're actually- As we've discussed, you're a nargon behind on your like transmitter code things. Your registration also lapsed a rigon ago. So right now your shift doesn't really even have that name at all. You have, like, you're not registered under it. You- If you are re-registering the ship, you could absolutely change the name of the ship."
"Gunnie: I feel like we just don't tell anybody that we're from the Red Hot, and I feel like we avoid the situation we were at last time."
"Barry: Yeah, so we're gonna give it a new name."
Gunnie: Yeah…
Barry: Any pitches?
Riva: The Blue Hot.
Sidney: That is the most perfect idea I've ever heard.
Barry: Blue...The Blue Cool?
Margaret: [incredulous] The Blue... Cool?
"Gunnie: I mean, it's just a cool name."
Barry: It’s just-
"Gunnie: I'm not sure it works for our purposes, but it's a really cool name."
"Skip: Cool, cool."
Riva: I like it.
Gunnie: The Blue Cool!
"Barry: Everyone just make up a name, whenever anyone asks."
"Gunnie: Yeah, exactly. I think everything goes, right? We don't need to be uniform."
Barry: Yeah. Yeah.
Gunnie: Cool.
"Sidney: Yeah. Oh, that's good. We'll disseminate misinformation about what our ship's name is."
Gunnie: Full scramble.
Barry: Right on.
Sidney: The Scramble... [while pointing at Gunnie] which is one of the names I'm gonna use!
Gunnie: I like that!
Barry: Full scramble.
"Sidney: [pretending to salute] Sundry Sidney, of the full scramble!"
Gunnie: [laughs loudly] I like it!
Skip: [sounding out the words] Full scramble.
"Brennan: You see, the bay doors open up, you see a ton of your Jib-Job workers, sort of- Raymond Zam is there and says, all right, well, time to go home. You see they all go off to like- after, you know, a long time with you guys in space, many of them are gonna go off to like, transbeam back to wherever they're from and then they'll come back to work on the ship, having a Jib-Job space that moves around the galaxy does provide some unique challenges to getting to work and back home. But, they take this opportunity, they'll head off the ship and sort of wave goodbye to everybody."
"Emily: I'll make sure to be as polite as possible to maintain, like, good relations with one of our revenue-"
"Lou: We're, like, White Lotus-style standing, going,"
"Gunnie: [waving] Goodbye, goodbye."
"Skip: [not articulated well, while waving erratically] Goodbye."
Riva: [cupping their hands around their mouth] Tips are welcome. Tips are welcome.
Gunnie: See you guys next time.
"Sidney: [waving] Thank you. Right on, right on."
"Gunnie: [waving] Right on, right on."
Skip: Right on.
"Emily: As we say aboard the Blue Cool, ""Right on."""
"Brennan: You see a young woman in like mechanics overalls out on the deck of this sort of outer tier of the Rec Station, looks up, sees the designation and goes,"
"Young woman: You guys know that your registration has lapsed, right?"
"Gunnie: [loudly] Yeah, we- we're gonna pay it."
Young woman: All right.
"Brennan: You see, she looks over and says,"
Young woman: We have standing orders when you guys come to not administer even critical aid without first inquiring about payment.
"Barry: Well, you've inquired."
Sidney: Okay… I think we need to grease some wheels here.
Gunnie: Yeah.
"Lou: I look over at Riva, just,"
Gunnie: [whispering] This is a- This is a comms- I think this is a comms-
"Riva: [stammering] Absolutely, absolutely yes."
"Siobhan: Well, first of all, I'd like to do an insight check against this person."
"Brennan: Uh, hell yeah."
Cast laughs.
"Ally: [highly amused] ""Against?"""
"Brennan: Go for it. Yes, yes, yes."
"Emily: While this is happening, can I create a distraction by playing my gun flute? So I blow [wheezes] a song into my gun? [laughs]"
"Ally: Wait, that's how you introduce us to the fact that you have a gun flute?"
"Lou: Yeah, exactly! That's-"
"Emily: It's my gun arm, but I can make a haunting flute solo that sounds like a theremin."
"Lou: Oh, that's what I've been hearing."
"Emily: She's gonna cast a spell, I'm gonna try to do that to distract them."
Siobhan: I got a 17.
"Brennan: All right, I'm gonna assume that you're like granting them disadvantage on their saving throw here. Give me a performance- We’re gonna say DC 15 performance check to actually distract this dock worker."
Zac: Can I sorta dance along just to help?
"Lou: Yeah, I think Gunnie's going to do like an upper body dance. Like, it's not a full thing but my upper body's definitely like-"
"Emily: [laughing and preparing to roll a dice] If these guys help me, can I do it with advantage?"
Brennan: I'm gonna say- I’m gonna say... Alright. [pointing at Zac] You give me a performance check to see if Emily rolls with advantage.
"Lou: [pointing at Zac] Uh, and I’d like to get him advantage."
Murph explodes into laughter. Everyone laughs.
"Lou: By standing behind him and going, ""Yeah, okay."""
"Zach wiggles his torso, pretending to dance."
Siobhan: This is a team!
Zac: Something is like hitting my brain and it's gonna make me like [jauntily] Ooooh!
Siobhan: We’re a team.
Zac rolls his dice.
"Zac: Okay, performance? [looking at his character sheet] Ooh, that would be a 15."
"Brennan: [pointing at Emily] Okay, go ahead and roll with advantage."
"Emily: Okay, okay, okay... [laughing, disappointedly] 12."
"Brennan: Alright, so... So the dock worker looks up- [pointing at Siobhan] What spell are you casting?"
"Siobhan: Well, I would like to cast Calm Emotions?"
"Brennan: Okay, you cast Calm Emotions."
"Siobhan: On them, which makes a target indifferent about creatures of your choice– [gesturing at everyone around the table] us."
"Brennan: All right, so you see what happens is you begin to use this psychic power. As Gunnie looks at a kind of jiggling Skip, and this horrifying gunmetal like gunmetal theremin, which just sounds like cold tundra wind, like [imitates what cold tundra wind sounds like] and you feel Calm Emotions work on her and she goes,"
Young woman: I wanna be very clear. I'm fully indifferent to whatever this is.
"Riva: Okay, excellent."
Young woman: I don't know what's happening and I don't care to know.
Riva: We are on the same page.
"Young woman: A hundred percent. We have standing orders that were from your captain, from you, [pointing at Skip] Captain Takamori, to not administer even critical aid without first checking in about money."
Skip sighs and shakes his head.
Sidney: Oooh.
"Riva: And why would the captain... would you think, do that? That seems like a..."
Sidney: I remember this!
Riva: ...way to shoot yourself in the-
"Sidney: Captain, [looking at Skip as if begging him to not go against her lie] you were feeling very tight at the purse and you said, ""we need to be careful about how much we spend!"", but then now you said, ""make sure to rescind that order"" and I, your little helper - so busy! - forgot to rescind that order."
"Skip: My name is Norman ""Skip"" Takamori. Rescind, baby."
Cast laughs.
"Gunnie: Well, you heard him, yes?"
Barry: Right on.
"Gunnie: Rescind, baby."
"Young woman: Alright, fill her up? Let's do it."
Skip: [slurred] Fill 'er up.
"Brennan: Okay, they proceed to fill her up. You see huge, like, fourteen foot wide tubes of like, water, and fuel and different like, coolants and reactor fluids and stuff like that begin to pulse into the ship. For the rest of you, is there anything that you'd be doing during this time? Right now, all they're doing is the- they're not doing any repairs, they're just refueling you now. Which is– But they're refueling you both for food and for fuel."
"Lou: Great, so, we're back up to 15 fuel."
Murph: So do we need to go talk to somebody about repairs then?
"Brennan: Give me an insight check real quick, Gunnie."
Lou: That's gonna be a cool 11.
"Brennan: Okay, I'm not gonna be a meanie here. I'm gonna say 11’s high enough. The command given to this docking crew was ""fill her up""."
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: Cool cool.
Murph: Can we get them to fix stuff?
"Lou: Yeah, we'll tell 'em-"
"Murph: Fill it up with fixing things, too?"
"Brennan: Cool, amazing."
Siobhan: And bolts.
"Brennan: Cool, great."
Emily: And shields!
"Siobhan: Oh, shields."
Lou: And take that used condition off of there.
"Brennan: Okay, so Gunnie, do you actually wanna go and talk to them about what they need to do out here?"
"Lou: Great, I'll supervise all of this, yes."
"Brennan: Amazing, you go out there. The main dockworker that you see out there is a young woman. She's got like two sort of like poofs of hair behind her, young black woman, she's got the mechanics overalls. She looks up at you as you approach and goes,"
"Young woman: Hey, is your captain about to rescind the rescinding or-?"
Gunnie: Yeah. We're gonna- We're doing the full nine yards on this one. Ball's rolling up. So we're getting now- We're getting ready to take off if you know what I mean?
Young woman: What?
Gunnie: Ball's rolling up. Everything's looking good.
"Young woman: ""Rolling up"" like...? [making a circular motion with her hands] Rolling up a hose?"
"Gunnie: No, like a hill, a ball is rolling up."
Skip: Ball is rolling up.
"Barry: Like our life is still bad, but we're moving."
Riva: Our life is bad?
Barry: Well...
Riva: I like our life.
Gunnie: You know- I- It's getting better!
Barry: Rolling up.
"Gunnie: It's rolling up. So, uh, we're doing the full nine yards."
"Young woman: So, we're talking full refuel, full-"
"Gunnie: No, no, no, no. Okay. Conservative refuel. We're only doing- We only want 10 units. We’re doing 10 units of fuel."
Emily: Such a big game.
"Gunnie: We want the whole back to scratch and then... You know, she's an old dinger, but we wanted- if you could take a little bit of the rust off, that would be great."
"Young woman: Alright, I'm just, I just work here at the docking station. I'd say you're almost close to totaled on this thing, but we can get it back up to working."
"Sidney: [quietly to Gunnie] Can I remind you, can we get the escape pod working?"
Gunnie: [whispering] Oh! Yeah.
Riva: [quietly] And the shields.
Sidney: [whispering] And the shields.
"Gunnie: [louder, to the dock worker] There's an old escape pod in there. It's gonna look like an apartment, If you could do a thing or two to that, and kind of get that back up to snuff. That would be ideal."
Young woman: You got it.
"Brennan: [pointing to Lou] So, you have all the costs and everything?"
"Lou: So, the cost of getting 10 units of fuel, taking off the used condition, and then the full ship repair, like, because of the lack of shields, that all is covered by the 3,200, those three things."
Murph: What about the shields?
Brennan: Shields come back with the full repair.
"Lou: Shields come back with the hull. So those three things for $3,200."
Brennan: Do you- She tells you that after– She goes into prices and says it'll probably be between 200 to 350 credits to repair the escape pod.
"Gunnie: [addressing the crew] Margaret is daddy, right?"
"Sid: Well, I think that we should ask Margaret."
Emily: And I politely knock on the door.
Margaret: Come in!
"Brennan: So, is anyone else going with Sid to check on Margaret in the room?"
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: As everyone leaves, I go,"
Gunnie: [quietly to the dock worker] They can get it started.
Zac: I'm like watching.
Lou: Yes.
"Zac: [takes a weird pose, with his fingers on the table, slightly leaning as if watching someone from above] Like, I am just kind of like, I'm like when a cat watches you work."
Gunnie: I don't think we're gonna have any problem paying for it.
Brennan: [giving a thumb up and winking to Lou] She gives you the thumbs up.
Ally: [to Zac] You're weirdly up high.
Brennan: Amazing-
Skip: Fill 'er up.
"Brennan: [to Siobhan] By the way, you see that one of the tubes they attached to the water filtration system, there's a second smaller water tube next to it - it's only about five feet across - that goes into the Rec Station's aquatic street system. So you're fully able to, if you want–"
"Siobhan: Oh great, so I don't have to robot this."
"Brennan: You don't have to robot this. Rec 97 is fully accessible to aquatic aliens and all sorts of, all sorts of galactic beings."
"Siobhan: It makes such a big difference, I mean the robot's fine but-"
"Brennan: Of course, exactly. So Sid and Barry, you knock on the door. [pointing at Ally] I am now gonna need a, kinda like, business check from you."
Lou: Business check!
"Brennan: We're gonna call this... expertise. So you're gonna add a plus 9 to this roll. If there's anything else you wanna do here to add to that you're also welcome to. We'll do it classic style, 15 is good, 20 is great, 25 is like, beyond superb."
"Ally: Okay, cool and a plus 9- And I'm really just kind of like restructuring everything. Trying to like- I wanna get us in all the unions that we need to be in. I wanna restore registration. I wanna get everything above board and it's like an actual working ship in a way that won't put us on the board for the shark lady?"
"Brennan: That– Depending on how well you roll, if you roll a 25 or higher, you can do all of this in a way that keeps you completely off the radar."
"Ally: Okay and I also wanna research Armstrong brand droid removers and like, try to find some sort of like a, you know, easy way to destroy them or keep them off of our ship."
"Brennan: Hell yes, I love it."
Lou: Let's go.
Ally: Advantage?
Brennan: How- You tell me if you're achieving that somehow. I don't think you get advantage here.
"Emily: Can I just hear Miss Margaret so hard at work and screw off my calculator watch, Handy Annie and like, shove her under the door to go help?"
"Brennan: Uh, amazing. You hear a little- Actually, as you're working, you hear a little knock at the door and Sid and Barry are both in there. Sid, we like zoom into Sundry Sidney's vision for a second and that like colorless terminator landscape. You begin to like, [electronic noises] looking at spreadsheets and documents. And you feel this like rusty, in your krystalline consciousness, this rusty old protocol that you haven't used in years comes back online, of your protocol android systems. Your like, executive assistant systems come back online. Sid, as you enter the room, you may absolutely grant the help action to Margaret."
Ally: Cool.
"Sidney: I used to do this, but captain never asked me to."
Margaret: There is so much work to be done.
Ally rolls their dice.
"Ally: Okay, 21."
"Brennan: 21! Amazing, cool, we love it. [Everyone clapping] So you're looking through here- Uh, literally, like matcha, suddenly on the desk in front of you. You have like a real desk for the first time, and there's a part of this where you feel an exhilaration in your body of something this tangible, and low stakes, but high stakes. [Ally nods, smiling] Like at the level that you do work, there's always 30 people watching whatever you do and in this one, it's like, “Oh, I could restructure this whole enterprise.”"
Ally: Today!
"Brennan: Today, yeah!"
Ally: [laughing] Definitely.
"Brennan: So, first of all, there- on a 20, there's some stuff that you can do to basically make that 3,200 an investment in the ship and become a real stakeholder in the ship. [Ally giggles] Norman Takamori is the sole owner of the Red Hot. Uh-"
Ally: Can I draw up some contracts that now we're co-owners?
"Brennan: You can absolutely draw that, but it's gonna take the Skipper's signature, but you basically are gonna-"
Ally: [smiling wildly] I have a feeling I can get it.
Emily: [excitedly] I can guide the slug to do it.
Everyone laughs.
"Brennan: So, you had those contracts drafted up that are gonna bring you on as a co-stakeholder in the Red Hot and you start putting all kinds of paperwork, right? Part of this thing- Uh, there's not like back taxes or weird stuff, this was bought as army surplus by the brigade and basically the captain cashed out his pension to get this, you see there's some... On a 21, there's some weird old documents about the brigade kind of going out of its way to help Captain Takamori get this ship. Wich is weird, cause you know, there's also some paperwork here that he was kind of drummed out of the brigade, sort of like, “All right take your pension early and get out of here”."
Ally: Can I investigate that?
Brennan: Yeah! Give me an investigate-
Ally: Are there like journals that [inaudible]?
Brennan: Give me an investigation check.
Ally rolls some dice.
Emily: Captain's logs?
Ally: That is a 13.
"Brennan: 13\. Hum, nothing, no records on the ship. What you're seeing here is a hole. You're- In other words, like Margaret's like, [pointing] “there's a story here”. There's nothing to tell you what the story is. You're just like, “huh? Weird bit of backstory for old Captain Takamori, what's that about?”, right? Like, “why would people that were fucking you over also help you?” kind of thing, right? So that's that! Getting into the business of it, right? The business of the ship, you see on that 21, uh, you absolutely- there are a bunch of unions you can join, up to you which ones you want to join. The two best options... If you come on as an owner of the ship, you can join U4F, which is one of- It’s the United Federation of Female Freedom Fighters, post revolution- It was founded by Nia Once, Molly Medea and Leilani Qa'Kuraya in cycle 1AE. It is basically a protection for all of the women revolutionaries that helped overthrow the Incorporated Elysian Republic. They're one of the most well-funded, well backed proldier unions in the galaxy. But there's some pretty hefty dues there. There are other quick ways to turn a dollar there. But if you were to do that, if you were to join up with U4F, that would be healthcare for the crew, that would be pension plans and other stuff like that. That's a very involved process, but you absolutely can get started on that paperwork here."
"Ally: Okay, as I'm starting it, it's all under my name and can I just put like a placeholder name for the ship so that this isn't being... Like, no one knows- We're not showing up on anything."
"Brennan: Cool, so all- In other words, you're like loading the gun with these [air quotes] “bullets” right now. Like paperwork is there, and you can submit this stuff [snaps fingers] when you're ready to make it go away."
"Ally: Yeah, I would love to talk to the crew and be like, “what do we wanna- Do we wanna change the name...?” Yeah. So I'm just leaving that blank."
"Brennan: Two things you can do, short term, is... you realize that your Jib- Job contract could become way more lucrative if you hire a chef. Having fresh food in the kitchen, bumps everyone's Jib-Job payments to the space, and you can get chefs that work for like a hundred credits a Nargon and it would bump everyone's fee from 10 credits to 15 credits."
Ally: Wow!
Brennan: So all those 40- So it's like more-
Ally: 50% increase?
Brennan: 50% increase on all the dues that are getting paid by your Jib-Job workers.
Ally: Okay...
"Brennan: And the last thing is this: one thing you could do, literally right now, is download Smash 'n Grab. You realize that the ship, that the captain was doing all this old word of mouth stuff. There are networks and apps and all kinds of different stuff to find good paying jobs without having to like walk into a bar."
Ally: Like a jobs board?
"Brennan: Like a jobs board! On the Rec Station servers. So Smash 'n Grab is one service that they hire proldier work out for. You could, and on a 21, you could get the ship online and also it's super- like it's super shady in a way that helps you. In that you don't need to register your ship under its real name."
"Ally: Okay, great. Can I go around to everyone in the ship and take really bad-ass photos of them that look really intimidating? [Pretending to take pictures with a camera] Just like I'm like, “wait, hold still” and I'm taking kind of like [inaudible]"
Emily: I'm like shooting mid air just like.
"Margaret: [still pretending to take pictures] Yeah, perfect, perfect."
Camera sounds.
"[Barry puts his back to Sidney’s, crossing his arms.]"
Barry: Back to back gunners?
[Sidney puts her back to Barry’s and takes a badass pose. Barry looks sternly into Margaret’s invisible camera.]
Brennan: [laughing] Back to back gunners!
"Margaret: Can you fire- Can you fire the gun? I’m sorry. [both fire their guns, noise of firing guns and an echoing Wilhelm scream are heard] Okay, great. We'll get that fixed."
"Brennan: It's incredible that this ship of actually quite powerful mercenaries, was just doomed by the lack of a business manager."
Emily: You know what? I actually use my gun to just blow wind in our faces.
Ally: Yeah!
Margaret: [taking pictures again] Oh wow you guys look so badass!
Cast laughs.
"Brennan: When we get over to this side of here [shows the side of the table with Lou, Siobhan and Zac], what are the photos like, as we do this?"
"Margaret: [once again looking ready to use her camera as the weapon it becomes in her hands, pointing it at Zac] Yeah, alright."
"Zac: [takes the same weird cat pose as before, looking at Ally from above his glasses] I'm still p- like sitting like a cat."
"Gunnie: Oh wow, are we kneeling? Okay."
"Margaret: This is really erotic, honestly. [she directs the camera to Riva]"
Riva: [raising their hands in a ‘I’m gonna get you’ fashion] Grrr.
"Lou: Uh, I think Gunnie changes his eye to red."
"Margaet: Very cool. [takes Gunnie’s picture] Yeah, perfect. Wait, flex a little bit, flex."
"Gunnie: I mean, I-"
Margaret: Does it cost money to flex?
"Gunnie: Yeah, of course it- Well, I mean, I didn't ask for musculature. That’s too- That was too expensive. I can do this [takes a boxing stance while smiling awkwardly]"
"Margaret: Oh, perfect. [takes a picture] Yeah, with that smile for sure, yeah."
Gunnie: Oh is that a smile? Sorry I was trying to be mean.
"Riva: If I'm really far behind him in the dome, it’ll look like he's taller."
"Margaret: Yeah, perfect."
Gunnie: Forced perspective? Okay.
"[Gunnie and Riva resume their posing, with Riva way behind Gunnie]"
"Ally: [laughing] She's all the way at the end. It's such a full room between the two. [becoming serious] Okay, great."
"Lou: [laughing, mimicking scrolling with a computer mouse] Just like scrolling through that weird job posting."
"Brennan: Oh! And after that, do you wanna check about the escape pod costs?"
"Sidney: Miss Margaret, there has been a slight increase in the price to make the escape pod functional and, as we respect you coming in and taking the mantle, we wanted to run it by you."
Margaret: Great.
Sidney: Would 200 to 300 credits extra be copacetic with you?
Margaret: Yes. Absolutely
Emily: I fucking skate off.
"Sidney: [skating super fast] Gunnie, it's a go!"
"Gunnie: [really excited] Okay great, great!"
"Ally: That's gonna be a yes. Wait, can I bring up the idea of like seeing if anybody knows any chefs that we can try to get on board?"
Sidney: I actually do know that Gunnie is quite a good cook.
Margaret: Really? Gunnie could be the chef?
[Lou is stifling his laughter in the back]
Sidney: And I can really sear a steak with this gun.
"Margaret: Incredible, you and Gunnie are gonna start catering the Jib-Job just for right now cause we need to start immediately, okay? We've got a lot of fees."
Everyone laughs.
Sidney: Technically we can start meal prep because they've all gone. So we can start meal prep now.
[Zac’s laughter comes out as a wheeze]
"Margaret: Perfect, perfect, what's on the menu?"
Sidney: What do humans eat?
"Margaret: Great, we're off to a great start."
"Lou: I don't think Gunnie's there right now, but Gunnie definitely just told Sidney that he worked as a cater waiter for a couple of gigs, like in-between, uh-"
"Emily: Gunnie had one really funny story of being a cater waiter, he's just told it multiple times."
Crosstalk.
"Lou: It’s the best story I have, yeah."
"Ally: So you're like, [air quotes] “he's a really good cook”."
Everyone laughs.
Brennan: So you get Sid and Gunnie signed up- [everyone laughs] ...signed up as the caterers.
"Ally: I wanna send out the most eloquent, like, update email to everyone at Jib-Job being like “We are so pleased to announce, a new-”, you know, like, “we have catered meals at Jib-Job” and like have everyone say yes or no, whether or not they're gonna pay more."
Brennan: Give me a persuasion check.
"Ally: Great, okay. Persuasion... [Ally looks at their stats, then rolls some dice] Hey! 27!"
Laughing and clapping.
"Brennan: 27? Margaret, in putting that- You act- You see, as you start filing them as the chefs, there's pure like business magic that you start filling out. Every other member of the crew, on a 27, gets ancillary kitchen staffed. So it's like, Barry's the inventory manager, and someone else is, like, food safety- Riva's like food safety inspector and you see-"
"Riva: I can't touch the food and I don't know if it's bad, is this okay?"
Everyone laughs.
"Brennan: As such, you see that you get an immediate response back from Jib-Job being like “We are elevating you to silver tier status. Thank you so much for choosing to invest more deeply in your Jib-Job leasing experience and for all of your staff, of course they will be-” and it pings you, uh- Jib-Job is a very shady startup. So there's no healthcare or anything involved with that. However, you do all get three staff meals per day. Meaning that food costs for the ship have been eliminated by Margaret."
"Ally: Yes! Okay, great, great, great, great! In the email that's like “these are the two new chefs” I used the really intimidating photos of you two. [gestures to Emily and Lou]"
Everyone laughs.
"Ally: So it’s like [takes a menacing pose] like, menacing"
Emily: And Barry's like half cropped out.
"Ally: You've been cropped out and I'm like,"
Margaret: [gesturing to Barry] I'm so sorry.
"Barry Syx: [confused] I thought I was in that one. Do they wanna mention the inventory guy, or... No?"
"Brennan: For the first time in, I think- For the first time in a game of D&D, like, chef's tools has become incredibly significant."
"Ally: Oh no. Wait what kind of check is that, do you think?"
"Brennan: Basically once a week, I'm gonna ask you all to make a cooking check and if you bomb out, there's gonna be some really strong complaints."
Barry: [to Gunnie] Should we go buy you some chef’s tools?
Sidney: Can we buy chef's tools on the Rec Station?
Gunnie: I mean- It depends. I got-
Riva: We’re in- We’re in a kitchen-
"Zac: Chef didn't sound too expensive, by the way."
Ally: Yeah!
Gunnie: I think-
Brennan: I love it.
"Gunnie: We can- We can buy some chef’s tools while we're- I mean, guys, it’s- Let's do it!"
Margaret: Some chef’s tools.
Zac: Its like in one those- [pretends to be holding a toolbox]
Gunnie: I'm assuming it comes in a box.
"Margaret: Yeah, those rollers."
"Brennan: Also Margaret, you have those documents for Captain Takamori to sign. You see Skip doing the like full beast crouch for the publicity photo."
"Margaret: Incredible. Hey, um, actually, can we get your photo with you holding this pen?"
Emily laughs.
"[Skip takes a pen and poses with it, looking serious]"
"Margaret: Great, and let's make it look like- You know, let's make it look more realistic, right? [Skip tries to smile] Why don't you sign this?"
Ally: I just start flashing. [camera sounds]
Margaret: [to Sidney] If you can help him remember his signature?
"Emily: Yeah, yeah. I hold up like an example."
[Sidney holds up a piece of paper for Skip while Margaret keeps taking pictures]
Zac: I'm just gonna look really closely at it.
[Skip takes the piece of paper Margaret handed him really close to his face]
Margaret: He's reading it.
"Emily: Okay, you know what? I send Handy Annie to guide his hand but like behind, so you can't see it in the photo."
Brennan: Amazing.
[Skip tries to bite Handy Annie]
Everyone laughs.
Brennan: [to Zac] Give me an intelligence check.
"Zac: I am very smart, but I only got a 12."
"Brennan: Well, honestly, it's been like a single day of you being in this body. So your eyes... Like, you're doing what, like, baby wildebeest do in the Savannah, like, get up and run right away. These shapes kind of swim into focus for you as you begin to narrow in on them, it's an object that's been handed to you covered in shapes. You understand that this is language. So you get that this is language captured on a page, but there's also part of you that's like, okay, this is like a skill I have to unlock. And on a 12, you don't quite unlock that skill. You know it says stuff."
Zac: I feel like I'm more responding to their vibes than the actual content.
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
[Margaret keeps taking pictures]
Skip: [signing the contract] Right on.
"Brennan: Incredible. Cool! And Marg- With that, Margaret Encino is a full investor in the Red Hot."
"Ally: Incredible, great."
[Everyone claps]
"Lou: I think, yeah. I think we all stand around and applaud. Do we know what's going on?"
Sidney: Congratulations!
"Emily: You hear a huge pop from inside my gun and it's scary, but then champagne pours out."
"Ally: Wait what? Ew! No, no, no, no. I don't wanna drink out of that."
[Everyone takes a glass of Sidney’s gun champagne]
Brennan: There's like some glowing shrapnel.
Barry: Give me some of that gun champagne.
[Skip drinks his champagne as if it was a shot]
"Gunnie: I love gun champagne. We don't- [giving a toast] Hey guys, the ball's rolling up."
Barry: The ball's rolling up.
"Margaret: Yeah, a toast everyone!"
Riva: The ball is rolling up.
* * *
[Everyone toasts then drinks]
"Ally: [showing their journal] This is the first time I've ever had a checklist while playing this game. I really am- I'm like [checking points on their list] “Got that done! Okay: join the union, hire chef...”"
"Brennan: Yeah! And do you wanna attempt to join- to, to get the application ready for joining-"
"Ally: Yeah I can ask everyone- Well, I don't know... How important is that?"
Margaret: What do we think about- I might join the union on behalf of this ship-
Ally: And then I explain like all this stuff that we... get out of it?
"Sidney: Gunnie, what would health insurance mean to you?"
"Gunnie: I mean, it would be nice. It wouldn't, in any way, eradicate what I have owed, but it would be, it would make, maybe, future payments a lot easier."
Barry: Let's get the ball rolling up.
Ally: [to Brennan] Do you have any info on what it would mean for him like going forward to have health insurance on future expenses?
"Brennan: I would say on that 21, it could alleviate some of the burden of Gunnie's minimums."
Ally: [looking at Lou and smiling slightly] Okay.
"Gunnie: We don't have to, I- You know- I- I- Guys, everything- I honestly feel great right now and I think that- I really think that we're in a place where things are about to start really hitting for me. So if we-"
"Barry Syx: Let's get you some- Let’s try to get you some insurance though, forget the ball rolling up. Let's have it rolling on a flat surface."
Margaret: Yeah.
Barry: Ball's rolling flat.
"Gunnie: Ball's rolling flat, yeah."
"Margaret: All right, great. I have all of the paperwork ready to join U4F and I just need to write in the name of our ship."
Barry: Didn't really nail that one down. What's another name for a hot dog?
Sidney: A wiener.
Barry: Just a wiener?
"Gunnie: [counting off his fingers] Wurst, brat-"
[Everyone repeating “Wurst”]
Sidney: Oh-
Margaret: Oh!
Sidney: We could be the Wurst Crew.
Margaret: [exclaiming] The Wurst Crew!
Everyone laughs.
Barry: [nodding appreciatively] The Wurst Crew.
Riva: Ooooooh.
Barry: The Wurst Crew.
[Skip failing to pronounce “Wurst”]
"Brennan: Do you wanna name your ship The Wurst, with a U instead of an O?"
Crosstalks of everyone agreeing.
"Ally: Yes, The Wurst, exactly."
Siobhan: Absolutely.
Margaret: [declaring] I am now proud co-stake owner of the Wurst.
Everyone claps.
Brennan: Unreal! How do you- [to Emily] Do you still have some champagne in that gun?
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: [laughing] I pop another one.
"Brennan: [imitates popping a champagne bottle that’s somehow in a gun that’s also his arm] You’re like, christen the ship, yeah. [sound of Sidney pouring champagne for everyone] Incredible! The costs you had already talked about were refueling 10 units, taking off the used condition, and fixing the escape pod."
"Lou: Yes, that's what 3.200 plus whatever the escape pod cost."
Brennan: Do you wanna re-register and take care of those like lapsed fees?
"Lou: I mean, that's, that's another 1.200, right? Registration."
Brennan: I believe-
Siobhan: I think just registration is 1.200.
Lou: Yes.
"Sidney: Yeah, I think we need to ask Margaret on that."
"Br: Cool, in that case, you guys, you rename the ship internally and are gonna apply to the union with that name, but you have not re-registered the ship yet with that name."
"Riva: Don't worry guys, I've got it."
Siobhan: And I fill up my putty tote.
Brennan: You fill up your tote?
"Riva: Don't worry, I can do it."
"Brennan: Riva, make a perception check for me."
"Siobhan: Perception, if I had the perception to know, that is a 14."
"Brennan: Oh, at the end of the dock, you see a large pink factory that says Pleasure Putty Factory Outlet and Training Center by Bargain Bliss. Basically it is a functional Pleasure Putty factory, but kind of like the Ben and Jerry's they have in Vermont. It's like, we make stuff here and it's where tourists come to see how we make it we're doing here. So you see that place, one of the main central hubs of this business over at the end of the dock."
Riva: Well maybe people who are interested in seeing how Pleasure Putty's made would be interested in selling Pleasure Putty.
"Brennan: Incredible! So Riva, you see, there's big opportunities there for you in terms of yeah, like you're saying, getting that registration coming in, like a lot of money has been going out, big, exciting things, but a lot of money has gone out with no promise of money coming in. U4F, you're holding off on until you get the ship re-reg- because we'll probably need to want the ship to be registered in that name if you're applying for that union."
Ally: Yeah okay.
Brennan: So might wanna hold off on that until you can actually pay back.
: A thousand credits.
Ally: Escape pod was how much?
"Brennan: Escape pod ended up being oh, only 200 more credits."
": So 3,400 is what went out to get the ship to where it is."
Ally: Registration is…
Lou: 1000 credits.
"Brennan: I will also say those repairs will take, they got a full crew working at oh, by the way, at Madrugada, they waived the docking fee. They did not waive the docking fee here. That's another 100 credits."
"Gunnie: Okay so we're at 3,500, Margaret."
Zac: Skip's gonna reach into his pockets and find money and see it for the first time. 'Cause I think the captain had 150 credits on him.
: Yeah.
Zac: Sees the like-
"Margaret: Thank you, captain."
"Br: Yeah, you hand over a little data card that has some credits on it."
Ally: Incredible.
Brennan: Incredible.
Sidney: I think I might \- I also had 100 credits.
E: I see the captain and instinctually follow suit. And give 100 credits.
"Barry Syx: Yeah, I got 60."
"Brennan: For the first time in a long time, you guys had like back wages and other stuff. You see this newfound belief in this joint venture putting to the communal, put- You guys are like reinvesting in your own ship."
"Lou: Gunnie goes and reaches into his pocket. And is like,"
"Gunnie: I can- If it's what we're doing, I just wanna\- are you sure?"
"Sidney: I was saving up for grenades, not my life."
Riva: Here is my 150.
: 150.
Riva: You got to spend money to make money. That's one of the Pleasure Putty mottos.
Ally: I give the 150 back.
Riva: Thank you.
": No, no, I take it, I take it."
Murph: You have my 60?
Ally: I can. [to Murph] I got your 60. [to Siobhan] Do you actually wanna give 150?
Siobhan: Yes I do.
": Okay, yeah."
: Amazing.
"Gunnie: [holding his card out] Come on guys, let me, I want to do it, we're all doing it."
: Begging you.
Skip grabs the card and hands it to Margaret.
: Skip.
Ally: How much is it?
Lou: 120.
Margaret: Are you sure?
"Gunnie: Yeah, the ball is rolling flat, all right?"
Barry Syx:
Gunnie: I'm gonna have money coming in like gangbusters. I'm not worried.
"Sidney: You're right, it's an investment. We're pooling our resources"
: Wow.
Siobhan: And we're gonna figure out all the cost together.
Zac: Skip is gonna see the sweat on your forehead.
Gunnie: It's gonna be great.
"Ally: That's 580 credits, everybody."
"Brennan: Ooh, baby and now at least your food costs are all taken care of by Margaret, wrangling this better contract with Jib-Job."
"Emily: Actually can we get a little bit of that money for spending cash, so we can try and find cooking utensils."
"Ally: Definitely, yeah."
"Brennan: I'm gonna say Margaret, you've already established a bank account for the ship and you can give like, corporate cards out to people."
Ally: I give one corporate card.
(all laughing)
Ally: Unless anybody else feels they need one.
Emily: I flash it to Gunnie.
Gunnie gives it an appreciative look and rubs his hands.
"Ally: I probably, I give it, I go,"
"Margaret: Okay, these are the gunner cards. Please, maybe don't mention this to the rest. I didn't get special cards for every person, right?"
Sidney: I totally understand.
Gunnie: I'd abuse it! I'd abuse it!
"Margaret: No, I don't think that."
"Gunnie: No, I would, I know myself. I'd abuse it."
"Brennan: Yeah, I'm gonna say Gunnie, actually, give me a perception check real quick."
Zac: Okay can I make one too to notice?
Lou: That's an 18.
"Brennan: As you're saying I'd abuse it, you look out and do see the Vale of Tiers is a fun neighborhood over raised on another sort of rotating tiers. You see the Emerald Comet House of Fortune, which you know is one of the best sort of gambling places. There's some tables there where people-"
"Gunnie: Hey, can I get 10 credits for chef's tools?"
Margaret: Definitely.
Gunnie: Thank you.
"Emily: I'm like really feeding off of Gunnie's vibe. So I'm actually gonna give my card to Handy Annie, and be like,"
clutch this tight.
Ally: She freezes it in a block of ice.
Emily: [laughing] Yes.
"Gunnie: Hey, whenever you guys are ready to go get chef's tools, I'm good to go."
: So incredible.
Margaret: Chef's tools probably cost more than that.
Ally: I give you 50.
(all laughing)
"Brennan: You give 50 credits to Gunnie. Now, as you guys prepare, full disclosure, repairs and refueling is happening, it will not be done happening for eight marbecs. Oh, so there's a bit, in other words, there's a crew of 10 people making repairs, but if anything fucks up..."
"Zac: Are you saying, if we go to a casino right now, It will be good?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, that's what I heard."
"Brennan: All right, is there any other upkeep business in house, on the ship before you guys head off into."
"Emily: This is just annoying mechanics stuff, but I am using my Ideal of the Tranquil to take a short rest and get my spell slots back."
Brennan: Awesome.
Emily: The spells I used on that man.
"Murph: I think I wanna talk to Marge for a sec and just say,"
"Barry Syx: Hey, first off, thank you for your leadership. I haven't seen such leadership since Barry One, but I'll follow you to hell."
"Margaret: High praise, I would never create someone who would attack you."
"Barry Syx: Appreciate that. But then again, would I attack me too? Is there any Barry Nine in Barry Syx? Anyway. There was a reason you wanted to come to this rec center. Is there anything we can do to help you with whatever situation you've got going on?"
"Margaret: Oh great, yes."
Ally: I relay all of the information that I have that the princeps is here somewhere checked into a hotel that we know about
"Brennan: The name of the hotel is the Obfusion Arms. Give me an insight check Barry, and do it with advantage."
"Murph: Ooh, nice that's a flat 19."
"Brennan: I think you watch Margaret like fully divulge, like personal, like UFTP information to you. It's just, again, it's a huge, Margaret's new presence, this new bizarre turning point in the life of the crew members of this ship. It's pretty staggering. Like someone in a leadership position over you, looks you dead in the eye and just tells you like an important secret truth with absolute trust, unflinching. And I think even with all the Barry Battalion, everything else, like, you know that's a significant thing for a leader to do, to be like, yeah, here's what's actually going on. Union stuff we're waiting on. You guys have put a lot of money out and right now we don't know about any money coming in. There the last opportunity on that 21 business check you did is Smash 'n Grab, the app, which is shady enough that you could try to get some jobs right now if you wanted to. Like that doesn't have an approvals process. You just put your ship We're the Wurst. You've put that name in. No, one's gonna find you."
Ally: Yeah let's change it to We're The Wurst as the full name.
: As the full name we like-
"Lou: Colloquially, am I saying it\- colloquially?"
": Sounds good, there might be an extra tongue dance in there."
Lou: Formally we are We're The Wurst.
"Brennan: Yes, so Smash 'n Grab is available to you right now, which you know, like a lot of the sort of like borderline social apps tends not to work in the far flung reaches of space. Like if you turn it on and you're out in the boonies somewhere, it's not gonna do a lot. Rec 97 is one of the greatest metropolises in the galaxy. So there are gonna be a ton of, even if you started a brand new account with zero reviews, you probably still get some gigs."
"Ally: Incredible, okay I think I told you all of that stuff. I would love to maybe scan like the news and stuff and see if the Royal family is reporting that the princeps is missing or like, if this is a big thing."
"Brennan: I'm actually gonna say, as you all walk off the ship, cause you've been trapped in that tin can for a little while you, you walk off the ship together and you see the Vale of Tiers on Rec 97, open away, bright neon flashing lights, there's performing Androids out on street corners. There's all sorts of different denizens of far-flung planets and the galaxy."
Ally: Is there an M&M store?
"Brennan: Oh you know there's an M&M store. You see a little sign posted up going like that has a little amplified speaker under it saying while visiting the Vale of Tiers of Rec 97, walk in a determined manner, try to look as though you know where you going, don't look up, don't look down! Welcome to Rec 97. You see the up and downsie daisies, which are these metallic rings that just have levitating energy in them. That goes up between the rotating tiers of the station. So people will just be like walking down a sidewalk or swimming down like an aquatic lane or like gaseously ambulating through a weird gas nozzle and just hit this thing and begin slowly levitating up or down. And as you walk out, you see a big like public screen displaying Rootersnoos which a Rec Station news, you see there is, very Norman Rockwell, 1950s looking red haired news anchor, That has a big cybernetic eye who looks out at the assembled people, in the Vale of Tiers, obviously pitching right to camera."
": This is Rootersnoos Ferret, Jimmy the Snout, coming to you live open rebellion on Rubian V? Reddit user Hotbox420, seems to think so. Analysts say a military intervention on the lithium moon could have enormous impacts on the galactic shipping industry and a galactic diva slips on a spacenana peel and falls up a flight of anti-gravity stairs? Tune in tonight for more."
Riva: Banana peel's going up.
: Cutting now to three hours of tweets we found.
(all laughing)
"Emily: I just realized that in a world where gravity, where there's no gravity, the ball going up is unexceptional."
(all laughing)
Gunnie: That's one way to look at it. I think there a couple of ways.
Barry Syx: At least this ball is not bogged down.
"Brennan: So you do see that there is news about like, it's not a headline, but there you see a news item as you're like walking into the Rec Station that like, yeah, like there's rumblings of war on Rubian V, which is not a thing that would plunge the galaxy into war. It's a thing where it's like, oh, this would disrupt galactic trade and would be a big deal because of the resources of this lithium."
"Ally: Okay, cool. But there was no, like this person is missing. Its more like, there are, yeah, there's like unrest."
Brennan: You didn't see that- go ahead and give me an insight check if you- Come on.
Ally: Lets see… it's 5:00 A.M.
Brennan: It is 11:55.
": No, it's 5:00 A.M"
Ally: That's a 16.
Siobhan: We are in a warehouse somewhere in the country being moved around.
Ally: We are in warehouse in Encino.
Brennan: That's a 16?
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: I think, you know enough- part of your job at UFTP is like managing: you're a one-woman department. So you do manage PR for your own department. You didn't see anything about the princeps, but if that headline has made it to Rootersnoos, you know that there are other news agencies that are probably working that story right now, right? Like, so it's I think you think it's like matter of time."
"Ally: Okay and then like, I mean, I probably don't even have to roll for this, but like I'm Reddit user Hotbox420?"
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely, 100%."
"Ally: I knew that, yeah and they didn't mention like the incredible nude, right?"
Brennan: It doesn't seem like.
Ally: Can I log onto Reddit and just see if it has any upvotes?
"Brennan: It's incredible, there has never been a comment. It actually has broken Reddit's record for most upvotes and downvotes. It's like breaking even, it's like,"
Murph: It's like steadily at 10.
: Steadily at 10.
: But it's so popular.
"Ally: Wait whoa, there's thousands of votes inside 10."
: It seems to have really fractured the community in this subreddit.
"Ally: I do get the whiplash of getting like hot, hot news and then an insane photo following that up."
": Yeah, 100%. You know that this hotel room under Madeline Maud is at the Obfusion Arms, but there's also, so you see news, about that Rubian V thing. So you think, you would guess time is of the essence, but not in a dead sprint kind of way, it's like you probably have a couple of Malton units before that thing about the princeps is widely known."
"Ally: Okay, cool. Then I, yeah, I think I start Smash 'n Grab at least to just see what the options are as we're walking around."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, with those dope photos you took before, Go ahead and give me a persuasion check with advantage."
Ally: Yes. That is a 13.
: Okay.
: Wow we're rolling well today.
Lou: Can I give them my potent aptitude and allow them to add a d4 to that roll?
"Brennan: Yeah absolutely, go ahead and add a d4."
Gunnie: There's some things about the algorithm you should know regarding Smash 'n Grab if you wanna get higher up.
Margaret: Oh right yeah I've never used an app that looked like this.
"Ally: That's a 2 so, 15."
"Brennan: Gets you to a 15, 15 is the DC for a good check."
Margaret: Thank you so much.
Gunnie: It's the same thing on all the tutoring and customer service apps I use.
Margaret: Oh incredible.
"Brennan: Yeah, what you have is like, is like the worst ready for you. You do like a PR thing and Gunnie fully changes it to like FRESH, GOOD, VIOLENCE, NOW"
"Gunnie: All caps is a big thing, I mean, you just put the keywords in there, even if you're not like that, like mine says that I can teach Spanish, I can't. But it's just a lot of people are looking for Spanish. You just put the buzzwords in there that the people want."
"Margaret: And no one checked, there are no agencies that are checking on the veracity of what you're doing?"
"Gunnie: No, absolutely not."
"Margaret: Okay, great."
"Brennan: So you head off into the station. You are, you're looking for the Obfusion Arms. You all get to an up and downsie daisy and it's near you're in this cool little like hexagonal intersection where kind of five blocks all come together. Riva, are in your drone or are you availing yourself of the aquatic amenities of the...?"
"Siobhan: Now, here is important question. How does Pleasure Putty interact with water?"
: Fully good. Pleasure Putty interacts with water it's of an aquatic convenience. It might get your water a little Pleasure Putty-y.
: I'll robot it.
: Cool so you're in the psychodrone. So you guys are all standing at this intersection of five different lanes that come in near this up and downsie daisy.
": Can I just use my mercenary thing where I basically can, like I can identify like companies, including names, reputations, commanders, leaders, but can I use it to try and find like a bachelorette party for Riva?"
": You absolutely can, I'm gonna say."
": I wanna find like a bachelorette party and like, who is the girl in charge?"
: Yeah for different reasons I also need that info.
(all laughing)
": So at this intersection, I'm gonna say you hear a raucous noise coming from a bar called the Brigader's Bier, which you can see is like an Amercadia classic, like Amercadian drinking hole."
: I make eyes with Riva and I point out.
": Okay, you want to come?"
: You're getting married!
: I think--
: She's getting married!
(all laughing)
": Amazing, at that moment. You check your thing : in the like 15 minutes you've been walking, three jobs have come through on the Smash 'n Grab."
: What are the prices?
": So a 15 is not super duper high, however."
": That's good, you said it was good. You used the word good."
": Yeah, here's the jobs that have come in. There's a job that's 300 credits a day, providing security for New Eden tech shipments, going to the Phoebus system. It would be a two month contract. So you'd be like running security for..."
": No, right? We don't wanna be tied down."
: You're getting married.
: One whole rigon? A whole rigon?
": There's another one, which is a 2K credits job knocking over a pawn shop on the Vale of Tiers, retrieving an item from the Vale of Tiers to return to this contractor and it's it says in parenthesis plus whatever you can grab from the pawn shop."
: Whoa. You get
: Wow spicy.
: Barry likes.
: Barry likes.
": A job comes in with no name for zero credits in the thing it says zero credits job and you look in the description of the job and it says, don't wanna discuss over app. Find me at Blue Heaven level, which you know is the very upper most tier of the Rec Station and it just says 25K."
: How about it?
": I mean I think that there's no harm in going into Blue Heaven and sort of scoping out. I can send Handy Annie ahead kind of work through her. See who's waiting around, get a feel for who it might be."
": Okay but we do have like surveillance capabilities, right?"
": I feel like 25K, let's just go in sunglasses on drinks in hand, let's just do it."
": Okay, wait no, sorry. This is my role, this is my role in the crew, Well maybe not, maybe let's do the hand surveillance."
: Barry slowly takes his glasses off.
: No we can all wear sunglasses we really can.
: Can we vote all right yeah.
": Yeah, definitely we can do that."
: 25.
": 25? Okay definitely, definitely. Okay yeah."
": Okay so what, Riva's gonna flip some quick Pleasure Putty and then we take another an upsie daisy up to Blue Heaven?"
": Maybe we can all real quick, like back up Riva in her sales, and then head up to Blue Heaven."
: Can I make an insight check on this bar?
: Yeah go for it.
: Because it's Americadian.
: Oh.
": Pretty bad, insight, sorry : five."
": It seems okay, on a five insight check. It's called the Brigader's Bier. It seems pretty standard honestly. You see, it's like an old, it's a legacy place. It looks like it got remodeled probably a couple cycles back, but yeah, for sure."
": Skip, you looking longingly at that building is there : the bar?"
: I don't know.
": Okay, cool."
: Can I look and see if they're like what Skip wants? Cause I think I am kind of feeling a little bit like bad about co-owning.
": I think like Skip is just like, I think Skip wants to try to like communicate to people. Like, it must seem very obvious that he's just trying to learn."
": Okay, yeah, yeah."
": So it's like, maybe there's not even like a very clear, like I wanna do this at the theme park. I'm just like, what is a theme park?"
": Yeah, I think I see that in Skip then and I'm like, here's the one thing you need to know and then I like teach you how to do that ""W' with your tongue."
: I can't personally do it.
(all laughing)
": Wow cool, he's a quick learner."
: Hey you can do anything.
(all laughing)
: He's getting better at learning.
: Let's move some Pleasure Putty.
": Yeah, I think I'm going to, as we go in since this lasts for an hour, I'm gonna do fourth level enhanced droid because you're in your droid body right now, right? And I'm gonna do it on all three of us. We all have advantage on charisma checks."
(all laughing)
Murph: Barry starts to sweat when he sees Gunnie get like this.
"Emily: Yeah, it's relations protocol. So all three of us have advantage, on charisma checks for the next hour."
": Oh, incredible."
"Brennan: Okay, so as you're sitting here, things are looking up, the ball's rolling uphill. You're on Rec 97. Your ship's getting repaired. Let me ask you, there is a desire to go to Blue Heaven. We also wanna go to the Brigader's Bier and see if we can flip these bachelorette party goers and there there's also this hanging thing about the Obfusion Arms. Are you guys planning to stay as a squad together or do you guys, are you splitting up? What are people doing? Oh, it's all– There's no pressure from me in either direction. I'm just interested to know what the plan is from all of you."
"Gunnie: I mean, I think it just kind of seems fun. We could like churn out Riva's thing and then go."
: And then we go right up to Blue Heaven raw.
: Yeah.
: Two sales.
: Guaranteed.
: Bar crawl for sure.
": Exactly, then I'll sneak away."
": Skip, this is called a bar crawl and it fucking rules."
"Brennan: Having those jobs come in on the Smash 'n Grab app, things are looking bright for the Wurst. You see, your ship's getting repaired. You've got some extremely exciting jobs coming in and speaking about making some cold hard credit, you hear the raucous noise of a bachelorette party coming from within the Brigader's Bier, classic Amercadian dive. You see, it's been retrofitted a little bit. It's a little touristy, a little bit like, the Amercadian space brigade is an enormous faction of these hyper military spacers. Captain Takamori was a brigader back in the day. So places like this crop up a lot on Rec Stations of in the same way that like you go to other places and people are like, oh, a McDonald's! Just like home! So this place very much has that vibe of like a McDonald's in another country, right? You walk into the Brigader's Bier and see big murals painted on the wall of golden fields of wheat from Kansas Amercadia and a long bar. There's an aquatic sort of pool in the center. You see that there are some brigaders on shore leave drinking off in corner somewhere, and an enormous party of women at the bar screaming and going."
: You're getting married! Give it up for Zvoon!
"Brennan: And you see a crackling glass olb filled with points of lightening emanating from a central dark purple fog, touching the outside of the orb."
Zvoon: [electricity crackling] [deep gravelly voice] I am so happy.
"Brennan: And it appears that the other humanoid women here are celebrating their orb friend Zvoon, who's getting married."
Ally: Very cool.
"Siobhan: So I have, as my background, I am a psychic adept. So when I intend to learn a piece of knowledge, I often instinctively know where or from whom you can obtain it."
"Brennan: Amazing, so to put that into the common parlance, the alpha friend is this woman named Mae who you can see is the one ordering drinks for everybody at the bar who appears to be, and she's just fully human, but appears to be Zvoon's best friend."
"Riva: Great, congratulations to your friend."
": Oh my God, thank you so much."
Riva: How many people is she marrying?
: Oh she's marrying a concept.
Riva: That's fascinating.
: Yes absolutely! We're so happy for her.
"Riva: Wow, so you're here to have a good time, right? So maybe you'd be interested in having an even more fun time by introducing some Pleasure Putty into the mix."
"Brennan: All right here it is, give me a persuasion roll."
"Emily: With advantage, enhanced droid."
"Siobhan: Oh with advantage. Okay, all right persuasion is 23."
"Brennan: 23! Okay, 23 you see, she looks at you and goes,"
": Oh my God, this drone is so fun oh my goodness."
"You see she says,"
": Zvoon, look out, we're gonna have to go to the docking station to open your orb, to get some Pleasure Putty in there."
"Zvoon says,"
: Oh stop you're too much.
"Brennan: You see that the bachelorettes around you says,"
"Okay so wait a minute how does this work? You walk around and you sell pleasure putt, oh my God, are we really, are we really going to get Pleasure Putty for tonight?"
"Ally: I walk up, can I look really, really good?"
Brennan:
"Ally: I would like to walk up and go,"
Margaret: Did you say Pleasure Putty?
"Riva: Yes, Margaret what, you know I sell pressure putty."
"Margaret: That's incredible that you also know my name, you must be psychic. I'll buy 10. I'll buy 10 of them. It's such an incredible concept."
Riva: That's very nice of you since you're my friend.
Margaret: Of course I'm your friend now I'm like.
"Emily: I skate in and I say,"
"Sidney: Excuse me you sold me Pleasure Putty and as droid, I'm incapable of orgasm, but it's the closest I've come to cumming"
"Margaret: Incredible, closest you've come to cum. Let's, I would like to buy 10 putty logs or whatever they are."
Murph: I come in with sunglasses on and go.
Barry Syx: This is actually made me cum hard.
(all laughing)
"Brennan: Okay, so I'm gonna need everyone on this side of the table to go ahead and roll a persuasion check."
: Okay.
Emily: Oh my God I got two fours.
Murph: I got a 15.
Ally: 25.
Emily: 5.
"Brennan: Oh, okay. Well the average of that is a 15, so, okay. You see, it seems less effective than what Riva sorta had going you're talking loudly about cumming hard and you see that Mae is like okay so all right you see Zvoon say,"
How did you cum hard?
"Barry Syx: Just all the putty, made me gush."
Sidney: I used the bathroom after him.
Ally: What you thought it happened in the bathroom?
Barry Syx: It did I went in there by myself and I just nailed the stuff. Just me and the putty. I nailed it.
Skip: Nailed it.
"And then, I destroyed the bathroom."
Skip: Nailed it. Fill her up.
": Skip, talk to Gunnie."
Barry Syx: Don't learn anything from what I'm saying.
"Brennan: Great, give me a persuasion check real quick."
Zac: Nat twenty.
"Brennan: So you see Mae looking around at you talking about nailing it hard in the bathroom and looks over and goes,"
Mae: Hello what's your name?
Skip: My name is Norman Skip Takamori.
Mae: Okay and you actually use this stuff.
Skip: Yes.
"Mae: And you well, you said fill her up."
Skip: Fill her up.
"Mae: Okay well listen, my friend's getting married. I'm still single."
Skip: Right on.
"Riva: Hey, if you're interested in being your own boss,"
Siobhan: This is going so well. Riva's never had this go well before.
"Riva: If you're interested in being your own boss, you could also sell Pleasure Putty. So it's a scheme where you're your own boss and you're a part of a beautiful triangle. That's three dimensional of people who are their own bosses."
"Brennan: Amazing, I am gonna, now that we've introduced the real, because you're not even here selling Pleasure Putty, you're selling becoming a Pleasure Putty salesperson."
"Siobhan: I do have Pleasure Putty to sell, it's not expensive. Will not make us very much money, but if I have somebody sign up."
"Brennan: Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and say, give me one last persuasion roll. Now that you're selling the real thing."
": Big money, big money."
: We need a win.
Siobhan: Oh yeah that's a 25.
: Yes.
"Brennan: 25 so you see, Mae, looks up, you see Zvoon goes."
Zvoon: Wait a minute you offer opportunities too? Become one's own master. [electricity crackles]
Riva: Yes.
"Mae: Oh my God, so wait a minute. So wait there's a triangle."
"Riva: It's this beautiful three dimensional triangular shape. where everybody within it is their own boss and the money travels in different directions that are different. Nobody's the boss of the bosses, but the money goes one way, but everybody's a boss."
Emily: I minor hologram a visual aid for this.
"Brennan: The visual aid you see, everyone goes, oh."
Margaret: I did just now get it.
"Brennan: You see Zvoon goes,"
"Zvoon: A spectral [indistinct] of the party of the bride to be, I command that all of us direct our attention to Riva. Do we sign something?"
Riva: You do indeed.
"Siobhan: And I take out a Pleasure Putty, branded tablet that just has, that you can just pass around."
Ally: Oh my God. Riva!
Brennan: A tablet starts getting passed around to these various individuals here.
"Ally: While we're really winning. Can I kind of like throw out to the group like,"
"Margaret: You girls, if you keep partying all night, you should come meet us at our hotel. We're all gonna be at the Obfusion Arms hotel."
Mae: Oh my God.
"Margaret: Later this evening, we're all gonna meet up there."
"Mae: That's incredible, wait, is there, okay. We sign up for this is there, but I don't know. Like I always thought of myself as a good salesperson, but I don't know a lot. Is there, do you guys offer courses?"
"Riva: There is a training facility, two buildings away from here and if you would like to sign up,"
"Siobhan: I pull out a second tablet different, this is a different tablet than other."
"Ally: On a 25, not only do you get them to sign up to become like direct reports to you to help sell Pleasure Putty, they sign up for courses starting 10 minutes from now."
Siobhan does a little dance.
"Emily: I think Sidney feels like a little bad and was like, really thought we were just gonna sell the putty."
(all laughing)
Riva: Those women are going to be their own bosses. It's gonna be a beautiful story for each and every one of them.
"Margaret: Okay, so someone does need to explain eventually."
: Yeah.
"Brennan: Incredible, so you see Mae says,"
"Mae: All right, girls, finish up your drinks we are going to the training center we're learning to sell Pleasure Putty lets get this bachelorette party on the road."
Riva: You're getting married!
"Brennan: I'm gonna say, we're gonna roll to see how many go ahead and roll three D4 for me."
"Siobhan: Thank you, I like this color. Oh yeah that's an eight."
"Brennan: There are eight attendees of this bachelorette party, including the bride herself, as they sign up and get ready for the courses, you immediately get, it's a every person that signs up and an additional five because you referred them to courses. That's 15 times eight, you get 120 credits this instant forwarded right over to you."
Siobhan does a victory dance.
"Riva: Oh, it feels good to be your own boss."
: Yes.
"Sidney: Riva I think that was ultimately like a really fun thing to do and as a bachelorette party, I think they're gonna have a lot of fun, but there might be some people that we don't put in the course direction we just sell putty to."
"Riva: Oh yes because some people are bosses and some people want to be bossed. There's a lot of information in the handbook about the sub dom culture of humans, which I find absolutely fascinating."
Margaret: Can I maybe borrow the handbook from you? Just to kind of look at and see what you've been reading.
"Riva: Well you do have to, it's a secret handbook you do have to sign up."
"Margaret: Oh, it's a secret handbook that only you get to see."
Riva: The courses are only for Pleasure Putty bosses.
"Margaret: Well, I'll think about it."
"Brennan: You just watch this group of bachelor of rowdy bachelorettes. Start to finish up their drinks and talk about going right now to the training center. Yeah, you see that as they do this, Zvoon goes,"
Zvoon: I am so excited to become my own boss.
Brennan: You see that some of the like lights in the bar explode as Zvoon gets more excited
Zvoon: This is so-
": Zvoon you gotta calm down remember you you're sort of like gamma radiation, blows stuff up if you get too excited."
Brennan: Gunnie give me a perception check. As everyone else has already been helping Riva on this one. I just want you to give me perception.
"Lou: Uh, nat 20."
Murph: Really undersold that.
Ally: Yeah wow.
Emily: He always does that.
Lou: Nat 20!
Emily: He loves to be casual about a nat 20.
"Brennan: So everyone else is very invested while that's all happening, you see there's a group of Amercadians over in the corner that look like shore leave they're wearing they're sort of like Navy whites. You see that there's an older gentlemen on a nat 20 perception, you see this as like top brass, looking over he was making eyes straight at the Skipper."
"Zac: I have like a, I'm almost signing up for the Pleasure Putty."
(all laughing)
"Gunnie: Ah, hey guys, great job by the way, I was waiting for my in. It felt like everyone was talking about cum and I was like, I don't know where I fit in, but."
Barry Syx: I could have arguably not spoken.
"Gunnie: No, no, very necessary."
Margaret: I think you sold it honestly.
"Gunnie: I think people are looking at Skip in a type of way that I feel like it's an Amercadian bar and he's Amercadian I don't know what's going on, but there's a guy in the corner who's looking at him some type of way, but not like the type of way that people look at me when they wanna come grab me and take my money away from me. But it's because I owe it to them. But it's that kind of vibe."
Sidney: Are you suggesting that we get out of here or do you wanna kick their asses?
"Barry Syx: Skip, did you recognize this person?"
Zac: Skip's gonna try to look casually.
"Gunnie: Yes, be casual."
Zac: He's gonna go like this.
"Brennan: You turn around like that and the guy goes,"
"Guy: Hey, is that Norm Takamori?"
Skip: My name is Norm Takamori.
Guy: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: You see this guy gets up on that nat 20 as he gets up, I'm gonna say that you actually know this dude, because he's part of the Weatherall family, which have been like, a big military family going way back on Amercadia. This guy's name is Gust Weatherall."
"Lou: I whisper, Hey, his name is Gust."
: Gust?
: Gust Weatherall.
: Gust Weatherall.
": He's a big deal, pretty big deal."
"Brennan: And he walks over, puts a hand out like this."
Skip: Big deal Gust Weatherall.
(all laughing)
Gust: Oh careful.
"Brennan: He says,"
"Gust: How the hell are you doing Norm? It's been a while. I'm surprised to see you come by the Brigader's Bier. I still owe you that drink, huh?"
Skip: Okay.
"Brennan: You see, he goes,"
Gust: Barkeep! We'll get two double death commandos on the ready.
"Zac: I think Skip's gonna try to like rack his like, see if there's, can I make any kind of check to see if I can find it in the brain somehow?"
Brennan: Yeah go ahead and give me a flat intelligence.
Zac: Nat one.
Brennan: This guy is being really friendly to you.
"Siobhan: Can I probe his mind and just read his surface thoughts, and then psychically tell the Skipper what's going on."
"Brennan: Yes, so on a nat one, what this guy's thinking of when he sees Skip is a derisive pity. That's what you feel from this guy. It's a derisive pity about like, look at this guy, never got the politics of the brigade and bought the story hook, line and sinker and we played for a patsy because he was not good with people."
"Siobhan: Oh, rough. I'm actually not gonna tell him that that's too sad. Let him think that he likes him."
Ally: Their first lie.
"Siobhan: It's just not telling, it's not lying."
"Brennan: This is a galaxy with a lot of grays in it. So within that thing of played for a patsy, that you're getting like largely emotional information. When you hear “not good with people,” you're getting the captain you knew a guy who was truly like mean to his subordinates and so it's the kind of thing where you get a feeling that this guy's an asshole, but his disdain for Norman, it's a complicated relationship. Like here was a guy who was happy to berate his underlings, but who also didn't know how to suck up to the right people because he was kind of an abrasive guy and like therefore didn't have any allies and therefore we took advantage of. Like you know what I mean?"
Murph: Like not a schmoozer.
Brennan: Not a schmoozer.
"Murph: Like crew cut mean, not schmoozer mean."
"Brennan: Yes precisely on that nat one, this guy said drink, and he's talking to you really friendly. You think it's possible that there's a very deep, intimate relationship, but you don't, you can't get the memory. But this guy maybe is like a former, either a former lover or a family member of yours."
"Zac: Give him a really, I go in for a hug."
"Brennan: He goes,"
"Gust: What the hell, Norman. Easy pal, get a fella a drink first."
Skip: Fill her up.
"Brennan: You see the barkeep is putting two double Dutch commandos on the table in front of you and says,"
: You want another one?
Skip: Okay.
: Fill her up?
Skip: Fill her up.
"Brennan: Makes the second one puts it in front of you. He says,"
"Gust: Jesus, Takamori, are you gonna be drinking both of those?"
Skip: Cheers.
Gust: Cheers.
"Brennan: He cheerses you. He does, do you down yours?"
Zac: I do.
Brennan: Give me a constitution saving throw.
"Zac: Constitution, I only have a 10."
"Brennan: This is one of the most powerful drinks in the galaxy double dutch commando consists of two scoops of vanilla ice cream, high Colonian vodka menthol demand extracts from certain poisonous tubers a two ribec zap of semi hundred positrons and a one quarter dose of pharmaceutical cublacane and all of that shoots down the hatch, your tenuous grasp on the controls of this body craft."
: Oh my fucking God.
Brennan: Your interface with the brain stem of this body craft is your like slug body is absorbing some of the effects of this.
Zac: So I guess I do I down it and I go.
(all laughing)
"Gust: What the hell, Jesus Christ."
"Brennan: He goes ah, okay."
"Gust: Oh, well, listen here Takamori you"
"Brennan: Riva you're on this guy's surface thoughts, right? He doesn't go to Cerebro slug. You hear the thought, it's wearing off and he says, well, take it easy Takamori. We'll see you down the old dusty and you get a pulsating red feeling, Riva of just peril as this guy walks away."
Siobhan: Well I can't see red. So that sounds fine to me.
"Brennan: Yeah, some sort of weird shade of blue."
"Barry Syx: Skip, do you need a lift?"
Skip: Yes.
"Riva: Skip, do you have any access to the memories of Skip?"
"Zac: I'm like pretty fucked up right now I imagine. I think I'm trying to remember, but like, I think what I would say to Riva is,"
"Skip: Eh, kinda. Not right now."
Sidney: I wonder if you could read.
"Riva: I wonder if I could get into his deep thoughts, deep memories in a way that maybe."
": He's gonna be so mad at us, just be prepared for that."
: If he knows what we're doing right now.
: That is true he would be really mad at us.
Sidney: But if something is wearing off and the captain is gonna be a danger to us in some way. It might be worth knowing.
Brennan: Your take on the it's wearing off was that it's an incorrect reading from this guy. In other words he didn't know to think Cerebro slug.
Siobhan: Right but he thinks that a thing that they did to him.
: Is wearing off.
Siobhan: Is wearing off.
: Yes.
: Okay.
Skip: Should we go to the pawn shop?
: Yeah.
": I think we're doing the leading, we a have a meeting."
: Yeah.
Skip: I can go to the pawn shop.
(all chattering)
"Riva: Maybe skip it, Skip."
Skip: Skip it? Alright.
(all laughing)
"Gunnie: If the Blue Heaven thing doesn't work out, we'll go to the pawn shop."
"Barry Syx: Its 25k versus 2k, let's just make the Blue Heaven work, right?"
: True.
Barry Syx: We need a huge win.
"Riva: I mean, we already made 120 credits. So that ball is."
"Sidney: Yeah, Riva though in the future I think we should talk about just selling the putty and not the whole package."
"Riva: The whole package is it's, how people."
Margaret: Work in progress we'll put a pin in that.
: Lets go to the Blue Heaven.
Riva: Make their own time. Don't they?
"Emily: So I think I can see through Handy Annie, can I use Handy Annie, to sort of case Blue Heaven and see like, and see who's sitting by themselves."
Ally: You can use your ability where you can see who's like prominent and in charge and maybe know their identity.
Emily: Yeah basically look through Handy Annie's eyes without any of us going in. Since they have seen all of our pictures already.
Ally: Oh you make a great point.
Emily: They'll know us. So I wanna use my mercenary ability through Handy Annie like send her in to scuttle about the bar.
"Ally: While we wait, can I get the captain like a plate of french fries and a hot coffee to help him a little bit?"
: Yes.
: What is this?
: It's a good idea.
: I know you will love it just dig in.
Brennan: There's still like a big plate of like Amercadian corn cakes that will soak up.
": Yeah, soak it up."
: Reach over with a napkin.
: Yeah I'm just kinda rubbing his back.
: No no no.
: Don't eat the napkin.
Brennan: Amazing. So you send Handy Annie up to Blue Heaven level. Go ahead and make a investigation check for me.
Emily: 13.
"Brennan: Awesome you get up there Handy Annie is scuttling around a lone Android hand would catch suspicion if it was not in public, as it stands right now, it's just as long as you're in busy areas, it goes kind of unnoticed. That means that you're sort of confined to public areas. So the question is how have you responded yes to the meeting on Smash 'n Grab."
": Yeah, I think everyone was so excited, that I kind of reluctantly being like we'll do it."
"Brennan: Amazing. Handy Annie comes across a small exterior cafe, sort of white chrome, exterior tables, little strange rotating neon umbrellas, and then sort of a small little espresso from this very like chichi cafe Blue Heaven is incredibly well appointed. There are a ton of domes, regalia, villas, and palazzos and things like that up here, sort of like neon, cyber palazzos. You see at the cafe where you are supposed to meet, you see there is a very well appointed suit wearing executive assistant Android next to an idling Rec Shaw. There's like a sort of like very muscle bound, kind of like working class dude, like pulling the RecShaw to get it to where you need to go. But it looks like you had guessed someone's assistant waiting to like waiting here where you've been said to meet and then like a mode of transportation to go somewhere."
"Emily: Okay, I think that's it. Do I see like any identifying things as to what company they might be working with?"
"Brennan: I would say on a 13, you don't see any company logo and the vibe you're getting is not like, oh, real, like, black ops, bag man. Like no don't fly any flags kind of thing. You're guessing like personal assistant. Blue Heaven has a lot of residential places. Now there are a lot of big corporate headquarters up in this level as well. But the way this is re\- 25 credits is a tremendous amount. It is not corporate money. Like a very rich individual could drop 25 credits on something."
"Emily: Okay I relay all this information and I say,"
Sidney: I think we've covered our asses. Let's go in guns blazing.
"Ally: Okay, wait, before we go in, I would love to just talk to everyone and say,"
"Margaret: you guys, as a team, I feel like we're really coming together and I really wanna talk to each person and say something that I like about them."
Ally: And just like
"Margaret: Gunnie, sorry, Gunnie. I'm sorry."
Gunnie: It's fine.
Sidney: It's normal.
"Margaret: No, Gunnie, like, you're so good at what you do and I just, I think, your work on this ship is not going unnoticed And so far, we're making a lot of great changes as a group and I, we're gonna join a union. We're gonna get healthcare. Barry you're so loyal, you're so strong. I just feel like you're gonna do a great job on it"
"Ally: And anyway, so I'm gonna use Sage Advice. So if I spend a minute talking to everyone, they get."
Brennan: Proficiency and your intelligence.
"Ally: And my intelligence modifier, which is plus five."
Emily: To what.
Brennan: You're picking a skill that you wanna give everybody as bonus.
Murph: Oh shit.
: Yeah.
Murph: Like persuasion or something?
Ally: Yeah that's what I'm thinking.
"Margaret: Yeah, Skip, I just can't wait to get to know you more. You just seem like a really different Skip, am I right? Sundry Sidney, I mean you're indispensable, as a person working together, you really helped me earlier, with that matcha and Riva, what can I say. Did you see that sale back there? I haven't seen something like that before in my life. The ball is rolling up, everybody."
All: The ball is rolling up.
"Ally: And then I'm also gonna, as we're walking in, just tag on master's advice, which is when I use Sage Advice. Now the first time that they make their skill check, they gain an additional bonus to the roll equal to my intelligence modifier. So the first persuasion roll will be plus 12."
: Ooooh.
: Jesus Christ.
Lou: How long does this last?
Ally: The plus seven is until a long rest. But the plus 12 is just the first roll-
Lou: And do we still have advantage?
Emily: The three of us have advantage
Siobhan: The three of us have advantage and I have a plus six to persuasion. So I should maybe be the person who is persuading things because that is a plus 18.
: Incredible.
Brennan: I wanna just double check.
: Yeah.
(all laughing)
Zac: It’s a plus 18.
Siobhan: Sounds right.
Sidney: Margaret there's something about what you said that made me think that we should really ask for more money. Does anyone else really get a strong feeling we should ask for more money?
: 50K no matter what it is.
Barry Syx: We should just send Gunnie in.
"Gunnie: Yeah, let me handle this guys."
"Zac: I think Skip is just like listening as hard as he can, like really feeling the confines of his language. Trying to like quietly repeating everything everyone says constantly."
"Brennan: Okay, sorry rule clarification. That is game breakingly good, rules as written Sage Advice only lets you lend your proficiency. The thing that lets you add your intelligence is Master’s Advice."
Ally: Oh got it.
: So we double that.
"Brennan: You hold on to this bonus for an hour, but it's single use. So it's the first time you use that skill, you add Margaret's plus seven."
Ally: Got it.
"Brennan: Everybody's got like a single plus seven bullet on a persuasion check loaded. You guys all get into the upsie daisy and with that clerian call from Margaret Encino, the ball is rolling up. You all begin to levitate through level after level, after level of this Rec Station, watching the lights and the different cities, literally as you're rising, it will be like buildings. Now the skyscape you're looking over and you can see past the neighborhood, the stars, and then you move through a circular opening and it's a new city, it's a new neighborhood on the next tier up. So again and again and again, as you begin to speed up and move by and just see constant Emerald, metallic, green cityscapes, and endless stars as you up, up, up up, and the buildings get swankier and swankier, and the clientele gets more and more McCoy to fleece off of them until arriving in Blue Heaven level and you guys enter out here and you see for the first time RecPols you see, which are Rec Station police. Now again in AnarchEra, RecPols are basically here just to protect like they're like: the city government is essentially limited to, like, a commerce center. It's like the business owners of the Rec Station are like, let's have security to keep people from burning our businesses down and that's what it's completely obvious to everyone that the RecPol are not ""civic servants"" here. They are here to stop people from destroying business interests"
Ally: So different from modern day.
"Brennan: So a group of RecPols that have these big smoke masks on these bright purple, basically like, unitards sort of offering like,"
"""Welcome to Blue Heaven level"""
"""Can we check you all in?"""
"and you see, you are effectively all being like checked in here."
: You don't need to check us in.
": Wooh, let's give it a shot."
": Okay, advantage plus seven"
"Siobhan: I'm gonna cast Affect Mind. Choose the target within range that isn't hostile towards you. This guy's not hostile towards us, he's just doing his job."
: You got a UFTP business woman in front of the pack.
: Target must make a wisdom saving throw.
Zac: Can I try a skills exploit thing?
"Brennan: Yeah, what you wanna do?"
"Zac: You attempt to predict the behavior of a humanoid you see within 30 feet. Make wisdom, perception check contested by their dexterity. If I succeed, the first saving throw the creature makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage."
": Whoa, awesome."
Zac: Wisdom versus sleight of hand.
Brennan: The RecPol You're trying to beat a 12 on perception.
Zac: I didn't get it.
Brennan: No worries.
Ally: Wait what were you?
Zac: It was pretty low. I'm pretty good to this one I got a nine and I'm trying to beat a 12?
Brennan: Trying to beat a 12.
Zac: I'll use Defiant.
"Brennan: Defiant is a one d4, you get a three or four you get there."
Zac: Two.
[Cast groans in sympathy]
": Okay, okay."
Brennan: So straight wisdom saving throw.
Siobhan: Wisdom saving throw.
Brennan: Your DC is a 14. You feel it does not work.
"Siobhan: Interesting. Okay, interesting."
"Brennan: You see the RecPol says,"
": No, I do. I do need to see his money."
Barry Syx: Right on.
Margaret: Oh great.
Ally: I show my pass.
"Murph: Yeah, I show my ID."
"Brennan: Okay cool, so this is the first\- your ship has checked in now, all of you- So, all of you have personal ID that has checked in Blue Heaven level, cool."
Emily: That sounds like a bad...
"Ally: Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Zac: It sounds good.
Emily: Only because people are looking for us they have a bounty on us.
"Margaret: If anyone's got a problem with us, we'll just kick their ass."
Zac: We'll punch 'em.
"Ally: Fuck, we're being so stupid. I just gave my official UFTP pass to be scanned? Yeah."
: All of you mosey on in.
Ally: I put on the smallest little sunglasses.
Murph: Mine are so huge.
Lou: I changed my eye to blue.
Siobhan: Riva just draws a pair of sunglasses on this absolutely blank psychic drone's face.
Murph: I hand extra sunglasses out to Skip.
Zac: I have looked like Weekend at Bernie's.
"Brennan: You guys arrive at Emfertoir, which is the name of the little cafe. As you approach Emfertoir, you see this very handsome-looking, officious, android stand up in a suit, nod at all of you gathered here and says"
"Salazar: Greetings, thank you for your prompt response to the request from my mistress. I would be more than happy to escort you to her palazzo where this business endeavour can be discussed in greater detail and discretion."
Margaret: I'm interested. Why did it say zero? And then you had to put the 25K in the message?
Salazar: [tilts his head] Greater discretion can be had at the mistress' palazzo.
"Emily: Can I do some kind of like Mind Link? Not to talk, but to try and like, see if there's any information in there as to who like the person that they work for is."
"Lou: Also during this time, Gunnie is fully getting in the RecShaw."
Ally: Oh my God.
Zac: He's just helping you in.
"Gunnie: Hey, thanks Skip, ahhh."
Skip: 'Course.
"Brennan: Sorry, so you can make a channel with them, absolutely."
"Emily: Yeah, but not like to chat. I kind of just wanna like almost survey and see like, who do they answer to, like in their coding."
Brennan: Give me a perception check.
Emily: Okay perception \- can it be investigation?
"Brennan: Yeah, it can be investigation."
Emily: Ten.
Brennan: Private.
"Sidney: It's a closed book, Margaret, a closed book."
"Siobhan: And this is a droid, right? So I can't, there's nothing I can do against him?"
"Brennan: Androids do have krystalline consciousness. You can attempt to do something here, but it might not be that successful."
Ally: Can I ask something and then roll an insight or investigation based on like facial cues as a response?
"Brennan: Yeah, I think so."
"Ally: Okay can I say,"
Margaret: Are we meeting Miss Maud?
Brennan: Give me an insight check.
Ally rolls their dice two feet away from their seat and has to stretch to retrieve it. Cast cracks up.
"Lou: Wow, that's like impressive."
"Ally: You have no idea how bad the roll was, too."
(all laughing)
"Emily: I said retrieving it. I was like, just leave it there."
"Siobhan: Throw it away, get it in the trash."
Ally: It's an 8.
Brennan: You guys see Margaret is sweating a little bit.
Murph: Alright. I put my sunglasses on.
Barry Syx: Let's get in the thing.
"Lou: I just start rubbing the seats the RecShaw, come on guys."
"Siobhan: Okay, I'm gonna get in the thing, I'm gonna cast battle precognition on myself so that I up my AC to 15 'cause I have a bad feeling about this."
"Emily: I will as an action, manifest my ideal to tranquil, to get my, a thing, my spells back and then I would like to just kind of like hook onto the edge of the Rec Shaw and like rollerskate behind."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: Just doing some sick tricks.
Brennan: You just link in.
Emily: Some sick tricks.
"Ally: I know this is stupid, but I, okay, so that was a eight. That was an eight on the die."
Brennan: For sure.
Zac: On the die?
"Ally: I have an ability where I can add no, no, no, no, no, no die, just in total. I can add a superiority die to it. Do you think adding a six, say I max out to that 8...that's a 14, is that gonna help me?"
Brennan: Think your superiority die's a d4.
"Ally: You are correct, so if I max out the d4-"
Brennan: And we pop that up to a bad 12.
"Sidney: I think it's not worth it, boss."
"Barry Syx: In this line of business, sometimes you get ambushed and then you just have to beat the shit out of everybody. In the Barry Battalion sometimes people would pay us a bunch of money. Sometimes they would just be like, hey, come to this small room, and then a bunch of dudes are there they jump down, Barry 3's got your back, he jumps up, he uppercuts, Barry 1’s on the other side, actually no Barry 1's the professor, I'm so sorry for confusing the Barrys. It happens sometimes Barry 7 is the one who always has your back."
Riva: Ones and sevens do look very similar.
"Zac: I slap the side of the Rec Shaw and say,"
Skip: Let's get in the thing.
"Ally: I get in, I get in."
"Brennan: You guys take off down the street and Salazar opens a gate wide and you go into an extremely expensive garden. You see that there is like an enviro modified garden with like real alien flora all around. Like, keeping plants alive on a station with this, with all this recycled air and there's no weather, like it never rains here. This is very chichi stuff. You see an enormous P.K. on the front and you see underneath it says ""Welcome to the Palazzo Khrome"" and Salazar ushers you inside and brings you to one of those like immediately the vibe here is, old lady rich. You walk into a side chamber of where it's like, all of this furniture is like gilded and antique and precious and sitting on anything in here is going to be miserable. Like, none of this furniture is for sitting. None of these plates are for eating. None of these halls are for walking. This is an incredibly expensive museum that someone is living in."
"Emily: Can I say have a little sock that I put over my roller skates, respectfully?"
Murph covers his face.
: Booties?
Emily: So they don't roll?
"Barry Syx: I appreciate you doing that, Sid. I was gonna say-"
: Stepping with tube sock-covered rollerskates.
: Oh my god.
"Brennan: Salazar allows you all to sit and says,"
"Salazar: Can I retrieve some tea, coffee, water, or sparkling beverage?"
Gunnie: I'll take the sparkling beverage.
Salazar: Absolutely.
Skip: Coffee and whatever I just ate.
Barry Syx: I'll have a cabernet? Is that nuts?
"Gunnie: Oh, will you give us alcohol?"
Barry Syx: Is that on the table here?
Gunnie: Can I have a cabernet?
"Salazar: The hospitality of the palazzo di Khrome is, of course, renowned far and wide. We have one Cabernet, one we wanna Cabernet over here?"
": Two cabernets, yeah."
Sidney: Can I get a bottle of Grand Cru on ice?
Salazar: So you want a full bottle? That's the drink you want is a full bottle?
Sidney: For the table.
"Gunnie: Yeah I mean, you don't have to bring two glasses of cab, just bring the bottle, we'll split it."
: Maybe some bread for the table?
Skip: Do you have a list of apps?
"Riva: I can't eat in my current form, but if you have any psychic donuts, I'll take some for later."
Gunnie: Do you have psychic donuts?
Salazar: Of course...
"Barry Syx: So: bread, psychic donuts, two cabs."
"Brennan: Moments later, he comes back with an exquisite bottle of champagne on ice and a bunch of glasses, a small, incredible ceramic tureen with like olive oil and balsamic in it and sort of swimming around. A sort of like wax paper bag of table bread, and also a shimmering hologram donut."
Lou: Gunnie fully gets up and does a dance.
(all laughing)
"Lou: Like,"
"Gunnie: We're \- this is it, guys! This is it."
"Sidney: We're taking this job! No matter what, we taking this job"
"Gunnie: We got the new Skip, Margaret's in here. I mean, this is incredible!"
"Sidney: Margaret, you have really done a number on our business."
Barry Syx: This is incredible
"Margaret: Okay, don't thank me yet."
: Too late.
"Barry Syx: Any of the times, like we've gotten jumped, like the Barrys got attacked, it was not in a place like this."
Gunnie: Exactly! I thought psychic donuts was a joke! And he brought one out!
"Sidney: I feel like it's a good sign that they brought out the champagne. 'Cause you would not pop a bottle of expensive champagne, if you're planning on killing people."
Gunnie: Come on.
"Brennan: You see, Salazar says,"
Salazar: Presenting her ladyship Hyacinth Khrome.
(all clapping)
"Brennan: And you see this old woman walks in \- platinum white bob wild, like leopard print horn rim sunglasses inside, you can tell they're prescription. Prescription sunglasses, weird like leopard spot, but black and white silk overthrow, like scarab crusted with jewellery and necklaces. She's gotta be like 4'10"" in heels and has a just incredibly groomed Norwich terrier in one arm."
"Sidney: Just like Barry said, I will go to hell for her."
(all laughing)
"Barry Syx: I meant that for Marge, not for-"
"Sidney: Yeah but I think it applies here, too."
Riva: I think that dog psychically has gone to hell. I read some very dark thoughts from this dog.
Emily: I'll pour her a glass of champagne and serve it to her.
"Hyacinth: [old lady voice] My darling, are you serving me my own champagne?"
"Sidney: Yes, yeah, I'm a companion droid so this is what I do."
"H: Oh, I heard about you, I think, I saw you in a commercial or something."
: Yeah.
Barry Syx: It was the one with all the curses in it. It was awesome.
(all laughing)
Barry Syx: They banned it.
"Brennan: You see she says,"
"H: No, there were no curses, This was Living Doll Cybernetics. You're the new droid from Living Doll Cybernetics?"
"Sidney: No, what commercial are you talking about?"
"H: Oh, I must be mistaken, we come here to discuss some present business as I believe...very well."
Sidney: Is Living Doll Cybernetics doing a multi-purpose droid now?
Gunnie: [quietly] This is for business...
"Sidney: I'm a little distracted, Gunnie."
"H: I'm sorry, what's the question?"
Sidney: Is Living Doll Cybernetics doing a multi-purpose droid now?
Barry Syx: I feel like this is a quick Google...
"Brennan: She says,"
"H: No, not a multi-purpose droid. Salazar put... do you have it? Do we have it on the DVR?"
Barry Syx: We don't have to watch.
Margaret: We do not have to watch commercials.
Sidney: We do.
"Barry Syx: Okay, we will."
Brennan: All of you watch a screen come on and a commercial play:
"""New from Living Doll Cybernetics, the latest answer to your Android needs."""
"Brennan: You see, resplendent in pink battle armor, the exact shade of your candy striper dress, huge gun, masked figure, like zero face, sort of like visored helmet, wheeled, rollerblade feet..."
(cool rollerblading sounds)
[ Sidney gasps]
: Flip!
(laser blasting noises)
...From Living Doll Cybernetics the answer to android violence newest and first in a line of battle competent droids… [kung kung]
"Block letters, like steel brushed font,"
Warfare Whitney!
"Brennan: And you see a visor comes back. It is exactly Sid's face, and goes"
I have one job.
"Sidney: No, you don't! What about pleasure? What about the protocol?"
Barry Syx: That robot sucks.
"Gunnie: Yeah, that robot sucks! Anyway, Mrs. Khrome, we are so excited to work for you and take employment in whatever form you're offering."
"H: So this is, well, do you want any details about it?"
Gunnie: Sure.
"Margaret: Yes, definitely, hi, I'm Margaret. Great to meet you, Mrs. Khrome."
"H: Oh, very well. Well, as you all know, I'm Mrs. Hyacinth Khrome. Discretion is the order of the day. My terrier, Mabrow… lovely, no?"
: What?
Margaret: Beautiful terrier. Malborough?
H: Mabrow.
Skip: [in his distorted way of speaking] My terrier Brabow?
"Margaret: You guys, we speaking the same-"
H: You making fun of me?
Skip: No.
Gunnie: He would never.
"H: Unfortunately, I find myself in need of assistance with very little time… left. My arch rival… Myalor Nabthacks. She has been a thorn in my side for cycles and cycles and cycles and now she thinks that at the last minute she can waltz into the Carbine Kennel Club Dog Show and take the blue ribbon from me? I don't… think so. I don't think so."
: She can't.
: She can't.
: She's not allowed to.
"Riva: No, because the dogs are the ones that win the blue ribbons, it's not her at all."
H: Does the name Aurora Nebbins ring a bell?
Skip: No.
(all laughing)
"Gunnie: He's...ah...he's...ah… Yeah, no."
"H: Myalor, that trollop, says for nargons now, ""Oh, I don't- No, I won't be submitting, no, in the kennel club, the Carbine Kennel Club, no. Oh, you know, ever since Patsy passed, I could never enter another dog show."""
Skip: Who is Patsy?
H: Her old pooch who kicked the bucket some cycles back.
Riva: And why is it bad that a dog would kick a bucket?
"Margaret: [quietly] You guys, we gotta hear her out. It means ""died."""
Gunnie: It's dead. The dog died.
Sidney: Can I actually get another Grand Cru? 'Cuz I finished it. I appreciate that the ice isn't even melted yet. So no need to refill the ice.
(all laughing)
"Brennan: Salazer looks and goes, and he goes to get another thing of champagne. She says,"
"H: I feel that 25,000 credits is an ample payment for services rendered. Tomorrow morning is the 78th Cyclical Carbine Kennel Club Dog Show at the dome here on Blue Heaven level. I want you to take Aurora Nebbins out of that dog show."
: Kidnap the dog?
"Gunnie: Well, we don't- We just have to take her out, or you see-"
H: I want you to break that dog's legs.
Barry Syx: Ohhh!!
Sidney: Ohhhh!
"Ally: I look her right in the eye and I go,"
"Margaret: I'll break that dog's legs for 48,000. No, no! Can I roll persuasion?"
"Barry Syx: No, no."
Zac: Is that persuasion or deception?
Emily: I am too drunk to give the help action.
Ally: Okay. It's a 10.
"Brennan: 10, gotcha."
"Siobhan: Even with that, plus...?"
Ally: Plus eight.
"H: I don't think you, so you see, I'm not of a mind to negotiate on price."
"Siobhan: I would like to use my subtle control, which is a part of my class. Where, as an action, I can cause a creature you can see within 30 feet to make a wisdom saving throw against my universal force save DC. And on a failed save, they forget a single aspect of a conversation, observation, or encounter that I was present for in the last 10 minutes."
"Brennan: Incredible, cool."
Zac: Can I do my-?
"Brennan: Yes, we'll do contested."
Margaret: I'll kill the dog and then I'll kiss it.
Zac: That's cocked. That is a 18.
Brennan: She's gonna roll this with disadvantage. What do you do to just momentarily distract this...?
"Zac: I just go,"
(coughs)
H: Is the man all right?
Margaret: I think so.
"Brennan: She goes,"
H: What were we talking about?
"Margaret: Nothing, absolutely nothing."
"Riva: We will do it for 48,000 credits."
Siobhan: And I roll a persuasion. Go ahead and roll persuasion.
Emily: With advantage.
Siobhan: With advantage.
Emily: Unless being drunk means I don't have concentration.
"Zac: Can we, like, ask her to do something else?"
"Barry Syx: Also, we're not gonna break the dog's legs."
": Yeah, persuade her about that."
Barry Syx: And I wanna get paid so let's get take that out.
Siobhan: That's a 32 to persuasion.
"Brennan: 32, she looks at you and says,"
Riva: And we're not gonna break dog's legs.
"Barry Syx: But we're gonna feed it like good food and it's gonna be like, not like froofy super health food. So it'll like take it out of the competition. But the dog will have a great day."
"Sidney: Yeah, we're gonna feed it Iams, and its coat is gonna look like shit."
H: For 48.000 credits… For 48.000 credits? I want you to make a mockery of that dog.
Gunnie: Done.
"Brennan: But you see, she says,"
"or for 25.000 credits, You may do as you wish and just make sure the dog doesn't compete in the dog show."
"Riva: Okay, so stretch goals,"
: Great.
Riva: Mockery. I'm good with that.
: It's all in.
"Barry Syx: 30k, we'll give the dog a bad haircut."
: Great.
H: This dog does not possess hair.
Barry Syx: Okay.
"Riva: Oh, it's a hairless dog."
Sidney: We could give him a tattoo.
: It is a royal…
Sidney: We'll give him a tattoo.
Barry Syx: I don't wanna give him a tattoo!
: Which one is it?
"H: If you, listen, you seem a reasonable robot. So what I will say is this,"
Riva: Bleep bloop.
"H: Aurora Nebbins is a Royal Blue mastiff. She will appear tomorrow at the Carbine Kennel Club Dog Show at the dome, you will have a very short amount of time to infiltrate the dog show and for 25,000 credits, simply remove the dog. The price you have asked, that 48,000? I am sure you will be able to reap that cost and more, ransoming the dog."
Gunnie: We are taking the dog.
"H: So, I will be happy to supply you with the contact details for Myalor to make this ransom exchange. Our interaction will end at 25.000 credits. Does that sound amenable to all parties involved?"
Ally: We shake hands.
"Brennan: Yeah, she shakes hands with you."
"Gunnie: One last thing before we go? And you don't, if you, we would love it, it just would help a lot. If we could get just 500 credits right now, for expenses, that would be perfect."
H: No.
Barry Syx: Right on.
Siobhan: I can only use my thing once a day.
Sidney: Do any of your friends have Warfare Wendys in their employ?
H: I just saw the commercial today.
Margaret: Can we watch the commercial again?
"Gunnie: No, I think we're good there."
"Sidney: I wanna see it again. Show it to me again, I wanna watch fuckin' Warfare Wendy."
Margaret: Okay.
"Gunnie: All right, we've got a job."
: Let's get outta here.
"Brennan: She says,"
"H: The dog must be abducted or destroyed prior to: your choice, what, up to you, prior to its ability to compete in the dog show. If it competes, the deal is off. Should you be successful in your mission, where should I make rendezvous in order to remit payment to you?"
Riva: Here?
"H: No, that will not be an option."
Barry Syx: The ship?
H: You will never set foot in my house again.
Barry Syx: The ship?
Margaret: The ship.
Gunnie: Is that okay?
Margaret: We have an incredible ship called the Wurst and it will be docked here and I can-
Gunnie: It's still called the Red Hot til we made the registration.
"Sidney: I mean, can we just give you a number to wire it to so that we're guaranteed payment and we don't get skipped out on?"
H: I will be handing an encrypted data card. I will not be wiring spacers.
Margaret: We'll be staying at the Obfusion Arms Hotel.
"H: The Obfusion Arms? Very well, I can meet you at the Obfusion Arms if you so wish."
: Great.
: Cool.
: Cool.
Riva: We are meeting a lot of people at the Obfusion Hotel.
"Margaret: You think that bridal party is gonna go? I think they said, no."
Lou: I'm gonna grab all the food and stuff that we got and I'll take whatever we didn't eat. We’re not leaving it here.
: Can we take bread?
Gunnie: Can we get some sippy cups for the wine?
: Is that all right?
Brennan: Salazar grabs some to-go boxes and hands them out.
Riva: Would your Satrogi dog like little nibble of psychic donut?
"Brennan: You see, she looks down at the little Norwich terrier, Mabrow, and goes,"
H: He eats exclusively money.
[Ally laughs]
"Brennan: And she stands up, and walks out, she does, she turns around and says,"
"H: If you do, I actually could… If you wanted to make more, I could pay you 150.000 bajar shillings..."
"Sidney: I don't know what that means, but no. The face made after that."
"H: All right, standard credits, fine."
"Brennan: You see, bajar shillings are a extremely discontinued defunct currency."
Ally: Incredible.
"H: I shall rendezvous with you at the Obfusion Arms, following the event at the dog show for which I will be present and certainly very shocked."
: So is that tomorrow morning or tomorrow evening?
": Tomorrow morning, bright and early."
"Riva: One last question. Now, are you interested in becoming your own boss?"
Ally: We grab you and drag you out.
Brennan: You guys skedaddle.
"Emily: As we skedaddle, I'm a little worried that we might have to sneak back into Blue Heaven. So can not kind of like do a scan of the area of any other points of...ingress? Is that a word? Because I'm like, we had that weird interaction with the guy and I'm kind of wondering if it's gonna be a hassle trying to get in again."
": Yeah, if there's like- like, a freight elevator, that kind of thing."
": Something like that, just like-"
"Brennan: Oh yeah, you can give me investigation check to try to find an easier way out of Blue Heaven level."
": Can I give her a help action? Like, look around?"
"Emily: Wait, I reroll ones, Failsafe! Yeah, baby!"
"Brennan: Amazing, yes, you absolutely do. Actually, what you can probably do is just find a like freighter hover truck. It's making deliveries up here and you could either try to bribe a driver or just like muscle your way into the back of one of those."
: Okay I point it out so everyone knows.
"Siobhan: Can I use telemetry to get the, like route for this truck? So we always just know where the truck is?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. You use your psychic ability, so this truck trundles its way out of Blue Heaven. You guys like jump into the back of this truck. Probably some sort of bribe, like an easy 10 credits will grease the palm of the driver to let this happen."
": I've got it, guys. I've got it."
: And you guys make your way back down to the Vale of Tiers. What do you do when you arrive there?
"Barry Syx: I just, ahead of time, I think in the future, maybe we shouldn't break dog's legs. Like, can we all just agree that's-"
"Margaret: Yeah, we're definitely just gonna, we're gonna capture the dog and we're gonna hang out with it."
: Right.
"Barry Syx: Cuz for me, it's already a jump- Like, the Barry Battalion used to save dogs and now we're kidnapping. So for me that's already a leap."
: We can think about it as like saving the dog from having to perform.
": Yes, and I can get there."
: I think we're gonna show that dog a good time that its owner doesn't normally show it.
: And then we're gonna hand it right back to the owner for a bunch of money.
: Yep.
: Right on.
: The important part.
": Okay, great."
: Can we go to this hotel?
": Yeah, I guess we actually need to get rooms there."
: Oh yeah.
": Yeah, what do you guys think?"
": Well, we told people that we would meet them there."
": Let's do it, let's head to the hotel."
: Or I guess we're supposed to meet them tomorrow so we could sleep on the ship tonight.
": Wait, the ship's gonna be all good soon."
": Yeah, I mean, we've probably got a couple marbecs left."
"Ally: I'm crunching the numbers and being like,"
": Tomorrow morning, head to the hotel."
: Maybe we should stay on the ship?
: That's great.
: Let's do it.
"Brennan: You could put rooms on your UFTP card. I mean, that's something you could do, but there's that has a whole level of complications to it as well."
": I mean, if it's just about casing the joint, we can go, like, poke around without renting a room."
": Yeah, definitely."
": One of those, like, I mean, hotels just have lobbies that you can just go to, right? That's the whole, a thing with-"
Margaret: Have you guys never stayed in a really nice hotel before?
: We don't have hotels.
"Skip: What is a ""hotel?"""
"Gunnie: Growing up I have, but not recently, no."
"Ally: Do they have like, can you get like a massage at this hotel?"
"Brennan: Oh, for sure. The Obfusion Arms– You can tell that Lucienne forked over some cash, like this is a visiting Monarch of an entire moon coming to a Rec Station. The Obfusion Arms is, honestly, probably a couple levels up from the Vale of Tiers. Not quite at the Blue Heaven level, but it's some swanky digs, for sure."
"Margaret: You guys, we're about to come in to..."
: Big money!
"Margaret: The ball is rolling up. We're going to the hotel. Everyone's getting a full body massage, slash, tuna, slash."
Gunnie: I'm gonna meet you guys there. I'm gonna go grab some chef's tools and I'll see you. I'll see everyone there.
"Riva: Okay, oh, great. I'm gonna actually send the robot, then, back to the ship and I will be here in person."
"Margaret: Great, we're all gonna share one room, but we are all gonna get massages. So that's nice."
: I can't wait!
: Yeah.
"Sidney: Wow, I mean, I've given so many massages, but never received one."
"Margaret: Oh my gosh, how exciting."
Gunnie: Huge. Huge.
"Riva: Aguatunisians don't get tense, but I do like the sensation of bodily touch, so I will take it."
"Brennan: So, you, now is this going on the UFTP card? Okay, cool."
Ally: It certainly is.
"Brennan: So, you throw down on that UFTP card and you're gonna get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 massages."
: Cool.
Brennan: In one room?
"Ally: In one room. Can I send a message out? Can I kind of cover for myself a little bit with work and be like… what am I gonna say? Fuck. I'm in, like, recruitment."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Ally: Yeah, so I'm just, I'm here for a little bit of a recruitment outing and I'll be out of the office. I wanna have like an out of office kind of auto reply to any emails that says that I'm in recruitment."
Brennan: Go ahead and make a deception roll.
"Ally: Yeah, I've only been rolling twos today. So, this is deception? Deception. There's a plus six to that. Hell yeah. Oh… yes. 24."
"Siobhan: All right, okay, there they are."
"Margaret: Hi, this is Margaret Encino. I'll be out of the office for the next few nights."
Brennan: 24? I know this is a role playing episode thus far… I'm gonna do a Box of Doom roll.
Ally: Okay.
[Emily sighs]
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: 24\. Cool Odds are in your favor. There is a plus 10 to this roll.
Siobhan: One.
: One.
"Brennan: Box of Doom got that, right?"
"Siobhan: No, come on."
"Emily: Okay, I saw 10 on the side. What the heck is next to a 10? Oh, it might've been a 7. It might've been 15. It might've been a 12. Might've been 17. Might've been a fucking 2! Fuck, it could've been a 20! 8? 16? 3?"
: It could have been anything.
Emily: Fuck! I just rolled a nat 20 when I threw that away.
"Brennan: So, you grab a room at the Obfusion Arms. So, you guys arrive- this resplendent it's like a\- in the way that this galaxy has a lot of retro elements, this is incredibly art deco, like, wild sort of like like Great Gatsby-style, but all in like chrome and neon and brightly saturated colors, as you arrive, there's this sort of bright orange wrought iron like Fleur-de- lis that are sort of vibrating and humming with krystalline energy. And you walk into this opulent lobby. There is a fountain in the center that you can tell, has like a krystal consciousness singing in the center of the fountain. There's hanging chandeliers overhead. You walk in. Yeah, they've got a room for you. It has a single bed and there is also a water bed, which is literally like attached to the aquatic systems in the hotel. So you'll just be in basically like a big latex balloon full of water in the room."
Ally: So you'll be one of the beds.
Emily: Latex? So we can like slap it around?
Brennan: It kind of wobbles. You can kind of like...
"Margaret: Sorry, Riva, sorry."
Gunnie: This is fun.
"Riva: No, it's fun!"
Ally: Can I go up to the concierge and try to chat them up a little bit?
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You guys see the spa opens up and you see that there is a concierge just for the spa saying,"
Concierge: I believe we have some massages this way?
Skip: Massage is good?
Gunnie: Great for tension.
"Margaret: Especially for you. We were doing a little bit of foam rolling, I believe? This is gonna be that plus..."
Lou: Can I get a massage?
Brennan: You can get a scalp massage or a foot massage.
": Okay, great."
Brennan: Not bad massages.
Lou: Not bad. I'll take a scalp massage.
"Ally: Two of, I would say, favorites."
"Brennan: You are all escorted off to go get some lovely massages. Margaret, you go over to the concierge. What you say to the concierge?"
"Margaret: Hi, how are you doing today?"
"Concierge: Oh, I'm doing fine, thank you. How are you doing? You are Miss Encino, correct?"
"Margaret: Yes, exactly."
Concierge: Lovely to have you. I just saw that booking came in today. I'm glad we were able to accommodate you.
Margaret: Me too.
"Ally: Okay while we're talking, can I try to do my charmer feat, which is my charisma versus their wisdom."
"Brennan: Versus their wisdom, here we go."
: Okay.
: What'd you get?
"Ally: 10, 11."
Zac: Did you say 10-11?
Ally: 11.
"Brennan: On 11, you see them fully charmed."
"Ally: Ohh, what are the odds? I am rolling so terrible today."
"Brennan: So you see this concierge look up at you and just go like,"
"Concierge: Oh, it's such a pleasure"
"Brennan: And again, you have an 18 charisma. You're like young, charming, attractive, wealthy, like, very, very bright. You see this guy go like,"
Concierge: And truly there's anything I can do for you please let me know.
"Margaret: I would love that. You know what I was actually hoping to try to meet up with, I think there's a potential client here, and I don't want them to know that I know that they're here, but I would love to be able to run into them like at the gym or something. Can you tell me where?"
"Ally: And then I ask about what's. Oh yeah Madeline Maud. Oh, whereabouts is her room?"
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a persuasion check. You're doing this with advantage.
"Ally: Okay, great. Nat 20. Nat 20 and a nat one. Whoa that's crazy."
"Brennan: He looks at you and says,"
"Concierge: Oh, of course."
"Brennan: And you see you've got him because you see, he looks and says,"
"Concierge: Oh, I actually see here. Yes, well obviously, you know where Madeline Maud's room is."
"Brennan: A lot of the corporate cards that go the credit cards that go out with UFTP agents will have encryption on them. So at your level, a lot of the cards read the exact same so that people can't, so that those numbers don't get shared out in a lot of places. So he says,"
"Concierge: Obviously, under the same card,"
"Brennan: You realize that it's an encryption and Lucien must've paid for the room. So he looks and thinks that this is you basically, and says,"
"Concierge: Well, you would know."
Brennan: And produces a card key for you.
Margaret: Perfect.
Concierge: Oh yes.
Margaret: What are you doing after this?
"Concierge: I normally, I'll have a staff meal and a drink in the hotel bar, and then I'll make my way home, but-"
Margaret: Very cool.
Concierge: Yeah.
"Ally: Wow yeah how long does this last? Is that crazy? Oh, it's a minute. No, it lasts for a minute, okay."
Margaret: Thank you so much for all your help. This was incredible.
Concierge: Yeah and you obviously still want room service for the two of you tomorrow.
Margaret: Yes now what did I say before? Was I going breakfast? Or was I going like champagne?
"Concierge: You said you wanted a short breakfast service with some mimosas, I believe and then you said, oh, we are supposed to keep a doorman at the back entrance for transportation."
"Margaret: Great, yep, all of that still sounds perfect. Thank you so much."
Concierge: Amazing.
Margaret: Amazing.
Brennan: Hell yes. You got some good intel homie and you had that card.
Ally: So I have this card.
Brennan: You have a room card and you have the number of the room. You have Madeline Maud's room.
"Ally: Okay, great. I go and get a massage."
"Brennan: And that's all for this episode of Dimension 20, tune in next week and we'll see you then. Bye bye!"

(upbeat music)
"Brennan: Hello, one and all. Welcome back to another thrilling episode of Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey. I'm your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me, as always, are our Intrepid Heroes. Say hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"All: Hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"Brennan: Last we left off, we were aboard Rec 97. That's right, folks, the glittering emerald chaos of one of the galaxy's greatest and best recreation stations, having just taken a job on the newly-minted The Wurst. Our crew came together under the guidance and supervision of new shareholder in this Amercadian retrofitted freighter, Margaret Encino. We took to the streets of Rec 97, looking for credits however we could get them, and downloading the proldier app Smash 'n Grab, got hooked up with a job on the Blue Heaven level of Rec 97, from one Hyacinth Khrome, who had a cool 25.000 credits if you could make a doggy disappear. That's-"
: For a day.
"Brennan: For a day. And maybe ransom it back. That's right- a royal blue Mastiff, by the name of Aurora Nebbins, has to get gone, and this is the job you have taken. However, that's not where we left you off. We left you off in a totally unrelated matter, in the spa of the Obfusion Arms in the cycle 220 AnarchEra. Here, getting all sorts of lovely treatment for the first time. As we said, last episode, the ball is rolling up."
": And we'll say it this episode a lot, too, I think."
: We're gonna say it a lot.
Brennan: We'll say it a lot this episode as well.
: We're kinda clinging to it. Yeah.
: It's sort of the gunner channel's catch phrase.
: It's pretty much a catch phrase.
"Zac: When I don't know what to say, I say, ""The ball is rolling up."""
Murph: The ball is rolling up.
"Emily: And then you say, ""Fill her up."""
"Brennan: I will be honest; something that people should get used to in this galaxy, our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is that things tend to happen all at once. An entire bachelorette party was recruited underneath Riva, in a Pleasure Putty MLM. We found the hotel room for Madeline Maud, which is connected to the craft of the Princeps Zortch of Rubian V. Admiral Gust Weatherall discovered ""Skip"" Takamori. Something there. We had a little bit of a psychic feeling of, ""It's wearing off."" What could it mean?"
Emily: It's wearing off. It also makes me think that they're going to send someone to make it stop wearing off.
: To re-up it.
Siobhan: Ooh.
"Brennan: And not only that, with a clutch nat 20, we got ourselves the room key, under the name Madeline Maud, and discovered that the card was connected to one Lucienne Rex, your old friend."
: My good friend.
"Brennan: Your good friend. 25K on the line. Almost disrupted, also, by a commercial for one Warfare Whitney."
: Almost. We don't know if it's almost yet.
"Brennan: Yeah. There's a chance it still gets really disrupted. Point being, a lot's happening on Rec 97. It's a wild, star-filled void out there, and you gotta do what you can. Folks, we come right back to a beautiful, tiled room, filled with steam, wonderfully warm. Everyone having a good shvitz here in the steam room. Post-massage, robes either on you or in your lap or hanging up at the door of the steam room. Let's go around the table here. Where are you in the steam room, and what's the state of affairs that we're in?"
"Lou: I think Gunnie is sitting in the steam room, the only parts of me that can shvitz are my head and my feet. I think he's mostly doing it for the company, and just to be with this crew."
": Oh yeah, I'm also not in the steam room, but I am in an adjacent, very steamed up… I guess it has to be the same water temperature, because we do have very sensitive."
"Brennan: Give me a Tech check, actually."
Lou: Me?
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead, go for it."
: Oh no. Oh no.
Emily: It could be good. Why did I say that?
Lou: 18.
: Okay.
"Brennan: Yeah, you and droid probably should not be in here. Come to think of it-"
": I think we're going to step out. This is not good for my gears. I wanted to do it, because it's just been such a great day, and the ball is rolling up, but Riva-"
"Siobhan: I'm in my Aguatunisian form. I sent the robot back to the ship, and I'm inside a pod."
Brennan: Amazing.
Emily: There's probably an Aguatunisian masseur.
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. You can get an underwater massage."
"Siobhan: I feel like there's enough underwater people who live here, and maybe there's hot tub-"
: You're underwater in a hot tub?
": Yeah, there's flowers floating in the water."
: Beautiful.
"Brennan: You're in a beautiful, beautiful pool. How about the Skipper?"
"Zac: Skip has saddled up, just right in front of wherever the steam is coming out of, sitting cross legged, no towel anywhere to be seen. Just getting blasted by steam. Turning bright red. The front side of me is bright red."
: Incredible. Yeah. Still have not turned those pain systems on.
"Zac: Oh, yeah. I do think I had them on earlier, but I definitely turned them off now."
: Oh my God.
Brennan: Incredible. Margaret?
"Ally: Yeah, I think I'm so relaxed. Just long day's work, reclining back, drinking something ice cold in this really hot steam room."
Brennan: Beautiful.
"Emily: I think Sid is not totally ready to make the leap to being massaged, so she keeps getting up and trying to help. And I think that she's essentially talked her way into giving the massage artist a massage."
"Brennan: Incredible, amazing. The massage artist is like, ""Okay, it's your time."" And what about Barry?"
"Murph: I think the Barrys used to all hit the steam room after a hard workout, so I think he's just staring off with a smile, but also, it's a lot. He's crying but smiling, but pretending that it's all from sweating."
Ally: Oh my God.
": It's crazy that I'm sweating from my cheeks so much right now. Skip, you should step away from the steam."
(Zac hisses)
: My face hurts.
"Brennan: Incredible. Margaret, you're sitting on this room key. Have you informed your crew mates?"
"Ally: I think so, yeah. I think I told everyone everything I heard."
: Amazing.
"Ally: Because it's the morning, right? Tomorrow morning. Two things are happening at the same time."
"Brennan: You guys are escorted from the steam room. Through changing rooms area, but you guys all have these fresh robes all the time. Beautiful, cushy robes. And there's a beautiful rock garden, with white sand and some greenery, and there's some singing crystals around, that harmonize and create this very pleasing atmosphere, and a table laden with fresh fruits. And there's a bunch of lawn chairs, all around on a deck with little assortments of fruit and things to eat. Riva, there is a heightened aquarium tank, that has all these little flowers and different things like that, so you're able to just kick it right here alongside everybody."
Murph: Just absolutely go ham on the fruit.
Ally: Yeah. I have some rosemary water. Something very tasteful.
"Emily: I think I've been trying not to say it, but then I'm just,"
"Sidney: So, Warforge Whitney. What did everyone think? What did everyone think?"
Barry Syx: She sucked.
: Yeah?
": Yeah, Warfare Whitney. She's like you, right?"
"Riva: I thought she looked like you, but really strong."
": Yeah, I thought she looked like you, but not as good, and not as authentic. She was a wannabe. She was a knockoff."
Riva: Not as nice.
Barry Syx: Yeah.
: Okay.
": Yeah. You know how sometimes, when a team doesn't win the Super Bowl, but they already printed all of those shirts, and those shirts get shipped off somewhere random? So then, you'll just see a woman wearing a shirt that says, ""Broncos '97 World Series Winner""."
: Am I the winner or the loser?
": You're the winner, you're the actual winner. And now, this counterfeit is showing up, on commercials everywhere around the Milky Way."
": Yeah, counterfeit. Yeah, she's a counterfeit."
": Yeah, I think she sucks."
"Margaret: Yeah, definitely."
: She sucks.
Margaret: Sucks.
"Gunnie: Clearly, she sucks."
Skip: Yeah she sucks.
: Thank you.
": I mean, roller blades? Come on."
: They look so fast.
: They're so 1997.
: They're not blades.
"Barry Syx: And then, then they came back a couple thousand years ago."
: But then-
: Then they went away.
: They went away.
: Then they came back.
: They did come back.
: Then they went away again. Roller skates.
"Gunnie: Plus, you can't skate backwards on blades."
: You can't?
: You can. You just have to do-
": Yeah, but it's-"
": I used to roller blade, with the Barrys. But then we switched to roller skates."
"Gunnie: Mobile, you know? I think?"
"Brennan: Margaret, you are sitting here, and have this key card for the room under Madeline Maud here. And you guys also all have a room that you're sharing upstairs, which, to be very clear, is a lovely suite, but does have a single king sized bed. And you can order cots from downstairs, but that's the situation."
Lou: I don't need them. It's fine.
: Sometimes I just sleep-
: I don't either. I might stay up and pace.
: Okay. And then you are a bed.
": I am a bed, and I sleep with one eye open. I'll just have one eye staring directly at who is sleeping on top of me."
"Ally: I'll sleep on top of you, and I'll sink to the side, and you can be in the water on the other side."
Siobhan: I'm happy either way. I'm not uncomfortable with either of it.
"Ally: Okay, great. I do want to go to this room."
": Yeah, if you want-"
": I have a key to it. If you need help, I've got a couple things that I could do to try and help you. I'm pretty stealthy, and I could turn security cameras off as we go."
Siobhan: I can also probably help with a lot.
"Ally: Oh yeah, because you can just appear in there, in the toilet. Wherever you go."
"Siobhan: Well, I-"
: Wherever you go.
"Siobhan: I don't want to actually do that, because the chemical makeup of the toilet is not great."
: Okay.
Siobhan: Especially for me.
": Look, I'm just spitballing here."
Siobhan: It's fine. But there's things I could do that could help.
: Great.
: Yeah.
": I'll probably just make things worse, so I will just stay away."
Lou: I'm with Barry.
"Murph: If you need someone to shoot a gun, I'll come running."
: I'm quiet.
"Ally: Okay, maybe the three of you go to the room."
": Our room, not the room?"
Murph: Not the room yeah.
": I actually think the brain-slug- I mean, we don't know he's a… I actually think that Skip could be really helpful."
"Ally: Yeah, definitely. Let's do that."
"Lou: I'm sorry, you hit it. Me and Barry'll stay by the elevator. You chat up anybody?"
Murph: You have to get cooking stuff.
": I can go grab cooking stuff, if now's a good time."
Ally: Chef's tools?
"Lou: Yeah, I can go grab chef's tools."
: That's a great idea.
Siobhan: Barry and Gunnie go on a shopping montage.
": Yeah, you want to go grab chef's tools?"
Murph: Grab some chef's tools.
: I think they're going to the casino.
"Lou: No, we're not."
Ally: How much money do you need for chef's tools?
Lou: You gave me 50.
Ally: Uh-huh.
": That should be good. I mean, if you want- I don't know."
: The food is so important to our future income. Do you want to just take 500 and bring back the change?
"Lou: Yeah, yeah."
Murph: Can I do an Insight check to see if Barry knows what Gunnie's-
Brennan: Give me an Insight check. You give me deception.
"Lou: Can I have advantage on this, somehow?"
: Okay. Just 10.
: 14.
"Lou: Well, you see Gunnie sweating and blinking a lot, so you think he's excited to spend this money responsibly."
": Dude, we're going to get some nice stuff."
: I'm going to get some great stuff. Great stuff.
": 500\. Let's see, all right."
: If you wanted to make some more money. I have a really easy and simple way to do it.
"Lou: Yeah, when I'm ready for Pleasure Putty, I will let you know."
: Great. I use Subtle Control to wipe that from his mind.
: We're getting chef's tools. I'm getting $500 for chef's tools.
"Ally: Okay, we've got Take the 500."
: Of the 10.000?
": I think I take you aside and I'm like,"
": Do you want me to go escort Gunnie, and try to be a steady presence?"
": Oh, yeah, you think-"
: Do you think that I need to? I'll leave it up to your discretion.
": Yeah, I mean, if that's something that you want to do. Wait, what do you mean?"
Emily: I know that Gunnie wants to go to the casino.
: What about Gunnie?
Lou: Are you guys ready to go? You guys ready to go? We got to go get these chef's tools.
": It's 11 o'clock at night, and he's going to go find some chef's tools at the kitchen store."
Lou: Gunnie's half way down the hallway. We headed out? What's going on?
"Brennan: Gunnie's got this beautiful robe, over a cybernetic body."
Ally: You should water gun him.
": We headed out? We headed out? Whenever you guys are ready to go, I'm ready to go."
"Brennan: Amazing. Margaret, You're heading up to Madeline Maud's room."
: If anyone wants to help me with the-
Siobhan: I'm helping.
"Brennan: Cool, Riva's going to help you out. And then Barry and Gunnie are heading out. The only swings here are Skip and Sid."
: Skip's going to go with me.
Brennan: Skip's going with Margaret. Amazing.
"Emily: I have to be honest with you. If I go, I will probably go to the casino."
: What are you talking about?
: I have done a serious inventory of my mental-
Lou: Are you guys talking about a casino down there? I'm not going to the casino. I'm going to get chef's tools.
Emily: I don't trust myself.
": Wait, but what's going on? Okay. No, come with me. Come with me."
: I don't trust myself.
": Okay, great."
"Brennan: Incredible. Okay. So, Sid, Skip, Margaret and Riva stay at the Obfusion Arms. Barry and Gunnie head out. Barry, you and Gunnie both hit the deck. Probably the vastest size differential of crew members, an enormous Barry and short king Gunthrie Miggles-Rashbax-"
Ally: Oh my God.
"Brennan: Hit the deck outside of the Obfusion Arms. Gunnie, what's the play?"
: What's the name of that casino?
Brennan: The Emerald Comet House of Fortune.
Lou: Emerald Comet. I know an awesome place where we can get chef's tools.
Murph: Chef's tools.
": Yeah, it's one over. It's real close to the Emerald Comet. We'll take a downsy-daisy down to there."
": Downsy-daisy, right on."
"Lou: And let's go take care of that, let's go take care of that, come on."
: Right on. Let's go take care of that. All right.
": Is there a place that would sell chef's tools either in the Emerald Comet, or near the Emerald Comet?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I'll call it a DC10 Investigation check. You're just looking for kitchen appliances."
: That's not...
: Can I help? Because I'm looking for it too. I just assume we're going to get-
Brennan: Give me a DC10 Investigation check.
Lou: I got a nine.
Siobhan: That's not a 10.
: nat one.
: nat one. Cool.
Murph: I think the tools are at the casino.
: Actually-
": We can probably get tools at the casino, I would think."
": I mean, they have a kitchen there. They have a kitchen there."
: They have a buffet.
"Lou: Yeah, come on, man."
": All right, let's go."
: Of course we'll find somebody there who knows.
Murph: We'll find somebody there who has-
: Oh my God.
"Lou: The ball's rolling up, man."
Murph: The ball's rolling up.
": Anyone we talk to, anywhere we walk in, it's going to have what we need, because that's the path we're on."
Murph: Right on.
"Brennan: You guys head to the Emerald Comet House of Fortune. You go back to the Vale of Tiers, near where your ship is. We're going to go back to the Obfusion Arms. We're going to leave you as you approach the Emerald Comet. Jangling, all sorts of games, card tables, holograms, slot machines, cybertronic Pachinko parlors, all sorts of wild things going on. Back at the Obfusion Arms, what are the steps you're taking? It's a simple elevator ride up to the floor, and a walk down the hallway towards where the room is."
Zac: Y'all have described this pretty thoroughly at this point-
: Yeah.
Zac: What we're trying to do. I feel like Skip is trying to figure out how to help for the first time-
Ally: Yes.
: Front back?
": I was thinking we could take the elevator, and then I would turn it off, so that no one else could enter the floor. And then we could go out and turn all the security cameras off, and then we could just go into the room. But sneak in."
": Yeah, I like that."
: I like that too. But we'll have to sneak in and be prepared that someone is likely in there. Okay.
"Siobhan: Well, I can also cast Calm Emotions on us. That only lasts for a minute, but each humanoid within a 20 foot radius sphere, centered on the point that I choose. We can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it's hostile towards."
": Okay, so if we see someone-"
Siobhan: If we see somebody else-
": Even if we ran into, they would just feel indifferent?"
Siobhan: They would feel indifferent.
": I mean, as soon as they left that 20 foot radius, they would again be hostile to us."
: But then they keep running back into it-
"Siobhan: As long as they don't have guns, we're fine."
Emily: Okay.
Ally: Okay.
Emily: This is good.
Zac: You want me to watch the back?
"Emily: Oh, the back. But I think-"
": The look out, yes."
"Emily: I'll shut off all the stuff for you. Both of you can go in there, and then we can see what's going on with the lookout."
Ally: Yeah.
: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Brennan, does the gunner channel exist when we're not on the ship?"
": Unfortunately, no. The comms don't exist when you're not-"
Siobhan: We don't have interpersonal comms. We can't do this.
"Brennan: You could send a message to the comms systems for Gunnie and Barry, but you do not have that surveillance, unless you're onboard the ship."
"Emily: Although, might I suggest, with your ability to make people fail their saves, it might be good with Calm Emotions, in case we encounter-"
"Brennan: Your telepathy has a range of 120 feet, I believe."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: Within a short distance, if you're all on the same floor."
"Siobhan: Oh yes, then just communicate through me."
Ally: Okay.
: And I'll read everything that you say-
Lou: The spa counts as a short rest?
Brennan: The spa does count as a short rest. Yes.
Ally: Good.
Siobhan: Great.
": I feel like you are very intimidating, and when you stand there quietly, you could make someone nervous, and give them disadvantage."
": Yeah. I say, we all go-"
Ally: You can just look extremely official with me.
Emily: Yeah. I say we sneak in and figure out who is in this room. Great?
: Great.
: Does that sound good?
: Sounds good to me.
"Emily: Margaret, you know more than us. Is this a good plan for you?"
": Yeah, this is a good plan."
: Okay.
: I got to get in there.
"Siobhan: Your dopamine is spiking, in a way that-"
Ally: Excuse me. Get out of my blood stream.
Brennan: Amazing.
"Emily: Can we take the elevator, and then I'll cast Off on it?"
Brennan: Hell yeah.
": To stop it, so that no one else can come up?"
"Brennan: Amazing. Is there a save associated with that, or no?"
"Emily: No, it's just any device that requires a software. ""This power allows you to activate or deactivate any electronic device within range, as long as the device is not being wielded by a creature, and has a clearly defined on or off function that can be easily access from the outside of the device. Any device that requires a software-based shutdown sequence to activate or deactivate cannot be affected by On slash Off."""
"Brennan: Awesome. I'm going to go ahead and rule that, yeah, that all checks out to me. Elevator rises up. You get to the 28th floor of the Obfusion Arms. All the way up."
"Emily: Can I shoot it with an electrical bolt, to short circuit it?"
Brennan: Awesome.
Emily: Just to be more dramatic.
: Yeah.
Ally: Yeah.
": Picture Warfare Wendy, or whatever her fucking name is."
"Brennan: You see there's a little neon, crackling electrical EMP magnet orb hits the elevator. Elevator emergency shuts down, and drops four inches, so there's a little step up into the hallway, as you fully unpower the elevator, and then hit the security cams."
": There you go, Miss Margaret."
: Thank you.
"Brennan: Cool. You know that shutting this off is going to absolutely conceal your entrance to that room. However, depending on how much scrutiny people are paying to the security system, they may notice that those things have gone offline."
"Emily: Well, there's a back door for us to get out of."
"Brennan: Skip, what's the move from you?"
"Zac: I think Skip is following along. As I understand it, I'm supposed to be near Riva, in case there's some sort of save-"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Zac: That I could maybe make something have disadvantage for. I do want to have, as much as possible, see what is going on in the back door, because there's, I guess, some driver or something coming up in the back."
: Tomorrow morning.
"Brennan: Tomorrow morning. You and Margaret step out into the hallway, and Riva, you can swim down the hallway. The hallway has an adjacent up above it, and there's about a one foot panel of glass in the ceiling, so that you're swimming above the hallway, looking down at the air breather hallway."
Ally: Insane visual.
"Brennan: Looking up, seeing an Aguatunisian swim over you. Sid is posted up in the elevator. You two step out into the hallway. You see that there is a staircase. You see that, in terms of accessibility points, you connect to that operative mentality and are like, ""What are the access points?"" You're certain there's other staircases on this floor, but the one that comes from the offices in the lobby is this one right here. You're like, ""Okay, if someone were going to be coming from downstairs, they would not probably go all the way out to the end of a row of suites."""
Zac: That's just unnecessarily long.
"Brennan: Unnecessarily long. You're like, ""That's the main artery staircase in the building."""
: I'll just post up by that.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Cool.
: Yeah.
: I'm like...
": That's good, yeah."
: And I go...
(all laughing)
": I go, ""Uh."""
Brennan: Awesome.
: Can I get one of those?
Ally: That's so loud. The loudest smile.
"Brennan: Margaret, it's a bit of a trip down the hallway. This thing is not right near the elevator. There's not a turn before, but it's that weird thing of walking probably 180 feet down a long hallway, looking back at the elevators far back behind you, through this hotel."
Emily: I'm going to take Handy Annie and catapult her to Margaret.
Brennan: Little android hand pops up on your shoulder.
Ally: I put the hand in my pocket. I look casual. One thumb in a belt loop.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me a Perception check. And Riva, if you're swimming along with Margaret, you can do the same."
: Oh.
: Ooh. Let's see.
Siobhan: I got a 14.
Ally: 11.
"Brennan: 14, 11. Nothing much to see. As you said, it's like You're walking by these hallways. It's so static here. It's a hotel. It's incredibly uniform. The only thing of note is that there's one open door, and there's a member of the cleaning staff changing some of the sheets. You move along towards the room that you're going past."
"Siobhan: Can I message everybody, ""Steal some extra shampoos and conditioners,"" as we go past?"
Emily: I leave my post to-
: No. God fucking damn it.
: Riva.
Siobhan: Uh-huh.
"Brennan: This is 180 feet down. If you want to get everybody in your telepathy, you might actually have to split the difference from where Margaret's going to be to the rest of your companions back at the elevator."
: Uh-huh.
"Brennan: As you say that, give me an Insight check."
Lou: Why we making an Insight check? Why we need Insight?
Ally: Come on.
: A 12.
: All good.
Ally: I hate this.
Siobhan: God damn it.
Emily: You have that look in your eye.
: You have had that look in your eye since lunch.
: Baby. I'm baby.
Zac: All good.
": When we were recording the Adventuring Academy, and Brennan was like, ""Things are going so well,"" I was like, ""You're going to fuck us."""
: Yeah.
"Brennan: Whatever do you mean? Margaret, you walk up and approach the door. It is very silent in this hallway."
"Ally: I was going to say, I try to listen."
Brennan: Give me a Perception check.
"Emily: I think you can do with advantage, because of Handy Annie."
": Yeah, you can."
: Okay. 20 not nat.
: 20 not nat. But because of the advantage or no?
: Because of the advantage.
"Brennan: Cool. Totally silent. Can't hear anything. And the doors are very heavy. They have the little key card thing that goes in front of them. This is a nice hotel. No expenses were spared. Handy Annie jumps up on your shoulder, and a seam opens in the skin, and a little screen comes down, measuring ambient electricity, and you see, as it orients towards the room, the dial goes up like crazy."
: Ooh.
: They're watching a movie.
(Brennan laughs)
Ally: Okay can I do something kind of shady?
Brennan: Yeah.
Ally: I would like to go and talk to the person who works here at the hotel who's restocking stuff.
Brennan: Yeah.
: And say I locked myself out of my room.
": You already have a key, don't you?"
: I know. I just want someone else to go in first.
Brennan: Amazing. You go back-
: The hotel staff person?
Brennan: You go back to the member of the cleaning staff.
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Incredible. You walk back to that room, see the person changing sheets. They turn around. This is an enormous, broad shouldered man. Grizzled, short blonde hair. Turns around to look at you. Says,"
": Oh, hi. How can I-"
"Ally: I am so sorry, but I cannot find my key anywhere. I'm just in this room down here. I don't know if you've seen me walk up and down this hallway, but I was wondering if you could pop my room open. Then I can show you. I'm pretty sure my room key's in there."
": Oh, got you. Go ahead and give me a Deception check."
"Ally: It doesn't feel good. Okay, let's see. 16."
Brennan: Cool.
: Cool.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an Insight check.
: It's good to have Riva on range.
: 21.
"Brennan: The guy looks at you and says,"
": Oh, sorry. You locked yourself out of your room?"
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: If you head back downstairs, there should be somebody at the front of the hotel to help you with that."
": Yeah, but my key is right there on the other side of the door. You don't have one of the universal keys? You can't pop me in there? I can show it to you right away."
Brennan: Margaret.
: Uh-huh.
Brennan: Couple things occur to you very quickly.
: Fuck.
"Brennan: In a moment, before I narrate what happens."
": Well, he's a grizzled, buff person."
Brennan: I'm going to say a couple of things.
Ally: Okay.
": It's 11 o'clock at night, right now."
All: Mhmm.
: Why are they cleaning?
Brennan: Why are they cleaning?
: Why are they cleaning? Why are they cleaning? What is he cleaning?
"Brennan: You look and see the sheets are not done very well. And from the cleaning cart, a blaster pistol comes out."
: From him?
"Brennan: From him. Drawing on you. The door bursts open behind you, Zac. Surprise, surprise- we are not going to go to TaleSpire, but we are going to roll Initiative."
": No, no, no."
: I think we're gone.
Emily: No.
: Us walking around a casino.
: I rolled a nat one.
Ally: Really?
: I rolled a 23.
": That's a three, in actual Initiative."
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Good thing we were together for the massages.
: That's when we needed to be together.
Brennan: Okay. Who got higher than a 16?
: I did.
Brennan: Okay. What did we get here for Sid?
: 23.
Brennan: 23 for Sid. What did we get over here?
: 19.
Brennan: 19 for Skip. Bada-boom. Did anyone get between a 12 or a 16? No.
: God damn it.
Brennan: And then what did Margaret get?
Ally: A seven.
Brennan: What did Riva get?
: Lucky number seven.
: Three.
"Brennan: Okay, we're going to resolve this super quick. Sid, you hear the noise of a blaster pistol off in the corner, and the door opening up by Skip. You're by the elevator."
: Are these in opposite directions?
: Opposite directions.
Emily: Okay. But I don't see anyone?
": If you step out of the elevator, you will see the people coming out of the door next to the Skipper."
Emily: People?
": People, it looks like."
"Emily: Okay, I want to throw, as a bonus action, a stun grenade down past the Skipper."
": Okay. Skip's going to have full cover, because he's posted up by the door."
: Uh-huh.
": Go ahead. This stun grenade. That's a bonus action, correct?"
": Yeah, that's a bonus action."
Brennan: Okay.
": I'm going to try and do that first, and see what that does. There's a DC14 Constitution saving throw."
: DC14 con saving throw.
Emily: Yeah.
": Okay. One succeeds, one fails."
": Okay. The one that succeeds, now I'm going to use my action to just shoot."
": Okay. I will say, of the ones you just stunned-"
: Uh-huh.
Brennan: These two guys coming up next to Skip are hotel security.
": Oh. I don't want to do that, then."
"Brennan: One of them is stunned, and you hear another noise down the hallway, but it's probably 80 feet down the hallway."
"Emily: 80 feet. Okay, I think that I can, when I throw a grenade, use it to get a little extra speed. Can I spend a kinetic die to get extra speed from the grenade?"
"Brennan: If that's an ability you have, then absolutely."
: I think that's a Corsair thing.
Brennan: Cool.
: Do you want me to look it up right now?
"Brennan: Yeah, take the time to look it up. As you're doing that, we'll just go a little out of initiative order. Skip, what are you doing?"
": Okay, there are two hotel security next to me."
"Brennan: Two hotel security have come up the stairs, due to the hotel stuff going on."
: Can I make an Insight check to see what they see of me?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
: My Insight is 16.
"Brennan: 16\. They're fully surprised. You are going before them in combat, and they were not ready for to pop off the moment they stepped out of the door."
"Emily: Okay, it says, ""Additionally, you can use your tech empowered self when you hit with a ranged weapon attack."" Would that not count for a grenade?"
: Would not count for a grenade.
": In that case, I will just use the rest of my turn to cast Disarm on the not stunned hotel security."
Brennan: Amazing. Okay.
Emily: It's a dex save.
Brennan: A dex save. Bada-boom.
Emily: Or strength. They can choose which one.
"Brennan: Copy that. Throwing a grenade's not a spell at all. Awesome. Oh, fails to save."
"Emily: Great, then I actually can use my kinetic dice on this, so I get an extra 10 speed. Disarm them, grab their weapon, the one who's not stunned. And then I have 35 feet of movement, so I'll spend that to get closer."
"Brennan: Amazing. Skip, on your turn. you see Sid skates out of the thing. A grenade, flash bang goes up in the staircase. One of the dudes is badly stunned. The one who's not, a truly cartoon magnet pops out of Sid's arm, and that guy's blaster pistol is gone."
: It's a blaster pistol? Cool.
"Brennan: Yeah. Go throw that in your inventory. Skip, it is your turn. That guy's still there. And there's also a stunned guy next to him."
: I'm going to use my fighters exploit guerrilla style to use Disengage as a reaction.
: Amazing.
Zac: And I'm going to full run down the hallway towards these two.
: Awesome.
Zac: And use my bonus action to Dash as well. I'll try to get all the way to the shot that was over here.
"Brennan: Hell yes. It's Movement plus Dash plus bonus action is 90 feet. You can get into the room with Margaret if you want, or you can post up in the doorway if you want, as well."
"Zac: I want to get, I think, in the room with Margaret."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Sid, you're skating away after some of these guys. You see Skip move with a speed you've never. Arms completely neutral, sprinting at a 45 degree angle down the hall."
: Can I look to see if he's wearing roller blades?
Brennan: Not wearing roller blades.
: Phew.
Brennan: Just running.
Zac: Roller blades suck.
Emily: That's what he said.
"Brennan: Incredible. Now, other hotel security: other dude goes to his stunned friend, grabs his pistol, and is going to take a shot at Sid. That is a hit."
Emily: Okay.
: Sid-
: Wait a second. But we're not supposed to hit these people. All right. You know what? I'm going to Energy Shield.
"Brennan: Cool, what does Energy Shield do?"
Emily: Plus five.
Brennan: To your armor class?
: Yeah.
Brennan: He still hits an AC20. Deals eight points of energy damage to you.
": And when he does that, I say,"
": Just so you know, I could have shot a little, angry thing of fire at you as a result. But instead, I just chose to protect myself, because I'm not trying to fight you. Just stun and disarm you."
: Okay. In the room-
"Emily: Okay, I'm going to fuck him up next time."
"Brennan: In the room, this huge, dangerous-looking dude, blaster pistol. And he's going to take a shot."
Zac: And I have just run in here too
"Brennan: Yeah, you've just run in here as well. Actually, that's going to be his priority. You see there was a moment where he was basically going to tell you to put your hands up and surrender, and then a dude sprints into the room, arms going straight behind him with the force of the wind. No joke, rolls a nat one."
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: As you run in, he goes, ""Ah."" You flatten out on the ground. Marge, that's you."
Ally: I run to the room and I use my key to open it.
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: How far away is that? Is that close?
"Brennan: I said 180 feet away, and I said this place is 80 feet from the elevator."
Ally: It's another 100 feet.
Brennan: Another 100 feet to your main room.
": Oh, then nevermind. That's crazy."
": We picked a real great time to go find chef's tools. The big mission, we're like, ""We're going to go get chef's tools."""
"Ally: Can I try to investigate and see, is this guy with UFTP? Or is this a third party muscle?"
Brennan: Give me Insight.
Ally: Okay. Hey. That is 15.
"Brennan: Because you said it right to my face, you assume this dude is UFTP, and you assume it's why he didn't fire on you, even though he had to drop on you."
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: You think this guy probably knows who you are.
Ally: And he is just freaking out right now?
"Brennan: Dude ran into the room, screaming like an alien, and you fired at him and missed."
"Ally: As a bonus action, I can use Critical Analysis, so I'm going to use that to target him."
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Which means that, instead of using my strength, I can use my Intelligence modifier. I'm going to grapple him and try to get the gun out of his hand."
"Brennan: Hell yes. Okay. You're using your intelligence. I will let you know the number you have to beat. This guy's going to add his strength. This is going to be an Athletics check from him, which means he's going to add his Proficiency to this as well."
: Cool.
Brennan: Okay. That's a high roll. You're trying to beat a 17. You are adding your Intelligence to this. Do you have Proficiency in Athletics or no?
"Ally: No, I have Proficiency in Intelligence."
"Brennan: In other words, you're just adding the flat plus five. To beat this dude, you need a 12 or higher."
Ally: 21.
"Brennan: Oh, baby. You see this dude go and fire at you. Marge, you are a shark. That's all you need. You reach forward, grab his pinkie, bend it backwards to break it, and he goes-"
"Ally: Krav Maga, motherfucker."
Brennan: And you've got the gun on this guy.
Ally: Great.
: Mhmm.
Ally: Who are you?
"Brennan: Incredible. That is your action, to make that attack. You have bonus action Critical Analysis on him. That is your turn. You'll be able to make an Intimidation next. Riva, that's you."
"Siobhan: Great, I would like to cast Affliction on this guy."
: Where he just gets a back tattoo?
Siobhan: Yes.
Murph: A sick shirt.
: It's a sick-ass shirt.
: Amazing.
"Siobhan: He has to make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target gains one slowed level, takes a minus two penalty to AT and Dexterity. And then, on its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both."
: Wow.
Siobhan: it's basically the opposite of Haste.
Brennan: Got you.
"Siobhan: And then, if a creature attempts to cast a power with a casting time of one action, roll a D20 on 11 or higher, the power doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn."
Brennan: Incredible. This is against your save. You said this is a Wisdom save?
Siobhan: It's a Constitution saving throw.
Brennan: Okay. He's a little bit better at that.
"Siobhan: I would imagine he is, but it's a cool spell."
Brennan: Unbelievable that I am being betrayed by my own dice to this degree. That is another natural one.
Ally: What? Yes.
Siobhan: And I would like to use Quicken.
Brennan: Mhmm.
Siobhan: To do Psychic Shunt.
Ally: Ooh.
"Siobhan: Which is, ""Use the psychic energy to thrust a creature you can see to the ground."""
Brennan: Mhmm.
"Siobhan: ""The target must make a Strength saving throw, and on a failed save, takes 1D4 kinetic damage and falls prone."""
Brennan: Okay. This is against the same target?
"Siobhan: The same target, yes."
"Brennan: And one is Cantrip, and one is-"
Siobhan: One is a Cantrip. Psychic Shunt is a Cantrip.
Brennan: Cool. That's a 19 on the die. He successfully does not go prone.
": He's upright. All right, well."
: Incredible.
"Siobhan: This one works, and that's enough for me."
Brennan: Amazing. You watch this guy truly being hit by waves of psychic energy from Riva. We go back to the top of the order with Sid.
Emily: Okay. I think I'm going to try and keep it nonviolent with this hotel employee. I think I just want to try and disarm him as well.
Brennan: Awesome. You just disarm him as well.
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool. That's another save?
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool. nat five on the die. Magnet stays out.
"Emily: And then I say,"
Sidney: This is not your fight.
Emily: And then I'm going to kinetic die to go an extra.
Brennan: You zoom into the room.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Go ahead, give me just a passing Intimidation check, if you'd be so kind?"
: Oh yeah.
: Come on.
: You're like-
Emily: I have a plus one.
Brennan: On your corner.
Emily: 11.
"Brennan: It's an 11. You say, ""This is not your fight."" And the guy doesn't look intimidated, but he's really considering that this might not be his fight, because he's like, ""I'm going to give medical aid to my friend,"" turns to his buddy."
Emily: It's another blaster pistol?
"Brennan: Yeah, another blaster pistol."
Emily: I think I just have all these guns magnetically attached to my gun.
"Brennan: Incredible. Skip, that's you."
Zac: Okay. We're in the room with this dude. Just this one dude?
"Brennan: This one dude, who's getting waves of psychic heat on him, and just got his gun stolen by Marge."
"Zac: I think Skip, some instincts are rising in him. I'm sure this situation"
"is more complicated than he wants it to be, but also it's simpler to him."
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: And so he's just going to take out his Vibro-rapier and fucking-
: Stab this dude?
"Zac: Stab this fucking guy. It feels like he's threatening his friend. Also, I want to skills exploit Angle Perception."
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: I can't tell if that's an actual action, or if it's just a free thing I get to do on a turn."
Brennan: Let's find out. Hold on one second.
Zac: Sorry.
"Brennan: No, this is all groovy. I was not anticipating combat here, but here we go, baby."
Lou: You guys came prepared.
Brennan: I guess so. We'll see what happens.
"Ally: Yeah, the big guns. Both completely gone."
"Lou: Yeah, the big gun is gone. But you guys got Sid and-"
Emily: You got one gun.
": I mean, we definitely got the guns."
Lou: Yeah.
: Yeah.
Lou: Woulda been overkill.
"Brennan: Okay. With your skill exploits, you can use them a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest. We haven't hit that yet. You're good to go. And it doesn't take an action. It's part of the attack action."
: Okay. Cool.
Ally: Cool.
: I'll do that.
Brennan: Cool.
: And so I'm going to roll Perception versus his Sleight of Hand.
Brennan: Cool.
: 15.
Brennan: 15 does not succeed.
: Okay.
Brennan: You're going to roll the attack straight.
"Zac: Okay, cool, and I'm next to an ally, so I get sneak attack right?"
"Brennan: Yes, you absolutely do."
Zac: I will just roll to see if I-
"Lou: Kill him, kill him, kill him."
Siobhan: If you just kill this guy and get no information from him.
: Hell yeah.
Zac: Dirty 20.
"Brennan: Ooh, that certainly hits. Go ahead and roll damage plus sneak attack."
"Zac: Okay, that's a D8 plus a D6."
: Yes.
(Zac screams)
Ally: Yes.
": Oh my God, a six and a seven on the die."
: Team.
"Brennan: Marge, you go, ""Who do you work for?"" And next to you, the captain goes, and the guy goes, ""I'll tell you everything."" And his neck opens up and he collapses on the floor, dead."
"Ally: Okay. Good job. We'll talk about this. We will talk about this. The heart was there. You're here, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Riva's out in the hallway-"
: Turning your guns on my gun.
Zac: I'm going to look. Can I investigate his body?
Brennan: Give me Sleight of Hand.
Zac: Sleight of Hand? Okay.
Ally: He's dead though. Advantage?
Brennan: It's about doing it fast.
Emily: I'll do it with Handy Annie.
"Zac: Okay, 22."
"Brennan: 22\. You're figuring this bod- You feel adrenaline, and you make more progress figuring out this body in moments. The slug body on that brainstem is eating the adrenaline and goes like, ""Ah, okay."" You see these fingers fly through this dude's stuff. You pull out a credit. You pull out a galactic credit card. You pull out a UFTP clearance badge. You pull out a fake personnel document for this dude's employment at the hotel."
: Cool.
Emily: Okay.
"Ally: Can I say, ""Put on all this clothes""? Is that crazy? Are they all bloody? They're bloody."
"Brennan: Oh yeah, covered in blood."
"Ally: Okay, never mind."
Brennan: Covered with it.
"Siobhan: Does the badge have a picture on it, though?"
Brennan: No. Badge does not have a picture on it.
"Ally: Oh yeah. Take it, take it, take it."
Emily: Can I grab the credit card to go grenade shopping after this?
"Siobhan: Wait, no, that's a UFTP credit card, isn't it?"
"Emily: Yeah, and it's going to get shut down soon, but I can use it until that time."
Brennan: Now this is the proldier mindset at work.
"Emily: I'm going to grab it, and tonight, before it gets shut down, I'm going to buy so many grenades."
Brennan: Incredible.
: With which shipping address?
Zac: Out of the back door of this room.
Brennan: These are hotel rooms. There's no back door. You see a big plate glass window looking out over this level of the Rec Station.
": Okay, got you."
": The blinds are drawn, so no one outside was looking into the room."
Zac: Go for it.
"Brennan: However shit has gone extremely sideways. We come out of combat. The dude at the end of the hallway is attending to his friend. However, you know that it is a matter of time. What do you do in this moment?"
"Ally: I book it to the room, to get in, hopefully with you guys. Say, ""We got to get into this room."""
"Brennan: It's incredibly clear to you, Margaret, there's no world in which this dude is in this room doing cleaning. He's clearly a plant here. And if the Princeps in the room were keyed in on it, there would be no need to disguise this operative. The difference between this person being here, and there being a stationed UFTP-"
: Outside of the door.
"Brennan: Outside of the door, speaks worlds of difference."
: Yes.
"Brennan: So, you rush down the hallway."
"Siobhan: Can I just have a look at this cart? This cleaning cart that he has; how big is it, and could we potentially hide a person inside of it?"
"Brennan: Incredible question. I'm going to say, yeah. With a successful Sleight of Hand check, you could hide a body in this cart."
: Great. Why don't we put his body in the cart?
Brennan: Mhmm.
Ally: Oh.
Siobhan: And then-
"Brennan: There's also a cleaning cart here, full of cleaning supplies, with all this blood on the floor."
"Siobhan: Right, why don't you do that? And I will use my psychic powers to clean up this room."
Ally: Incredible. Thank you so much.
Siobhan: Yes.
"Siobhan: An upside down telekinetic Aguatunisian, fingers here, and just cleaning solvent floats, bippity, boppity, boo."
": [All] Like, a really fucked up Beauty and the Beast."
Brennan: Yeah.
: But it's crime clean-up.
Brennan: Yeah. Alakazoo- and it's just a body slowly tumbling. Folding in half. You hear bones snapping as it rolls into the cart.
Emily: Definitely watches it for a little too long. Like a Broadway play.
Zac: I'm cramming shampoo and conditioner in the bag.
: Get as much as you can. That stuff is worth a lot of credits.
"Brennan: Incredible. You're taking care of the room. There still is that hotel security, who's doing his best not to hear whatever the fuck is happening in that room. You rush towards the other room, have the key card, swipe and open it?"
: Yeah.
"Brennan: Boom. All of you that are in the room see the hallway fill with blinding light. Margaret, you are blinded. Get your hand up a little bit too late. You see, in silhouette, floating in space, there is a humanoid alien. They turn around to look at you, as a pulsating quasar of energy fills the hotel room. You feel, rattling in your bones, a brilliant warmth, and the feeling of a cosmic super-intelligence filling every part of your body, and the humanoid floating in space next to this whirling vortex of energy, sentience and matter, goes, ""It's not what you think."" We're going to cut from there to Barry and Gunnie! All right. We move to the awning of the Emerald Comet, level seven of the Vale of Tiers. Oh baby. A house of fortune, where a man's luck can change. Incredible."
(Brennan mimics slot machines)
"""I hit it, yeah!"" You see people smoking at slot machines, people playing more of the fun arcade games. You see little parlors with skeeball, Pachinko parlors. You see there are some tables of people actually playing blackjack, dealer games. And off in the back, you see the beautifully ornate double doors leading to private games of poker, stud, hold 'em, all sorts of real high rollers suites, so to speak. They got to have chef's tools here."
: Got to have chef's tools.
Murph: Have chef's tools.
Lou: They have to.
: Have to have tools.
: What exactly are we defining as chef's tools? Knives?
"Brennan: Knife, pot. Oven."
: Full oven. Okay.
Lou: Do we not have an oven? Do we need-
Brennan: You have full ovens. The ship is-
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: Those would be good for an amuse bouche.
": Yeah, perfect. Perfect."
Lou: I feel like we-
: One clam.
": We find the chef's tools, and then we can leave. Yeah? Does that sound right?"
": Yeah, that sounds right."
: Yeah.
Murph: That sounds right to me.
Lou: Cool. I'd like to look around for somebody who works here.
: Amazing. You see that there is a cocktail waiter who walks up.
"Lou: Hey, can I?"
Brennan: There you go.
Lou: Thank you.
Brennan: There you go.
Murph: Thank you so much.
: That's delicious.
: It's like a beautiful Old Fashioned or something. Incredibly-
: It's got little cherries in there.
: I love the little cherries.
Murph: I don't hate that.
Lou: Can I have another one of these with more little cherries?
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. What table are you playing at?"
"Lou: Oh, we're not playing. We're just here for a quick-"
Murph: If we have to play-
"Brennan: If you want to just take a seat at one of the blackjack tables, I can absolutely. I'll come back."
: We'll have a seat at one of the blackjack tables.
Ally: Oh my God.
"Gunnie: Before you go, we came here, because we're looking for chef's tools. Kitchen equipment."
(all laughing)
: Is there a chef in the back?
": Yeah. Presumably, they use tools."
": We didn't see a Bed, Bath nearby, so we figured we'd just hit up the casino for some chef's tools."
Gunnie: Chef's tools. We're here for chef's tools.
Barry Syx: Yeah.
": Let me go ask. I'm actually going to talk to our chef, and just see-"
Gunnie: Okay. Thanks slim.
": Hey, there you go. And you see he takes off. So you're both sitting at the blackjack table here. The dealer looks over at both of you, there's digital hologram cards being slid. It's almost like the cards are sliding on an air hockey table over the green felt."
Lou: Yeah. Very cool. Very cool tech.
"Brennan: The dealer looks over to both of you and says,"
Dealer: Ante up?
"Gunnie: Oh no, no, we're not playing."
Barry Syx: We're just getting-
Gunnie: We're here for chef's tools.
Barry Syx: Free drinks.
Gunnie: Yeah.
Barry Syx: Chef's tools.
Gunnie: We're here for kitchen equipment.
Barry Syx: Yeah.
"Brennan: The dealer smiles and says,"
Dealer: Of course. On the house.
Brennan: And just takes two one credit chips and puts them in front of you.
"Gunnie: I mean, we're here."
Barry Syx: It's free.
"Gunnie: Yeah. Yeah, I'm in."
Barry Syx: We've been on the same team. I'm on his team.
"Gunnie: Yeah, we're on the same team. Yeah."
Brennan: Amazing. Are you going to pool your credits and stuff and have one play together?
: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool. You take two credits. Go ahead and roll a D20 for me.
Lou: Okay. That's a 15.
Brennan: You hit. You double it to four credits.
Gunnie: The ball is rolling up.
Barry Syx: Free money.
Gunnie: The ball is rolling up.
Barry Syx: It's just rolling up.
"Gunnie: Shit, we got four. Let's do it again."
"Brennan: Okay, you have four credits riding on this thing right here. I'll say you play another hand before the waiter comes back. Go ahead and roll again."
"Lou: Oh, that's just a two."
Brennan: Cool. Credits leave.
Gunnie: That was fun.
"Barry Syx: Dude, we need a huge win."
Gunnie: The ball's rolling up.
Barry Syx: The ball is rolling up.
Gunnie: We've been great.
Barry Syx: 500 credits. One hand.
Gunnie: Barry. Barry.
"Barry Syx: 500 credits, one huge fucking hand."
"Gunnie: Barry, Barry. Barry, come on, man. Come on."
Barry Syx: We need a huge win.
"Gunnie: It would be crazy, right? It would be insane."
Barry Syx: It would be awesome.
Gunnie: It would-
"Barry Syx: We'll come back, it'll be like hanging out with the Barrys, just celebrate."
": Yeah, right? We'll all go to the spa again. We'll get a spa on the Wurst. We'll get a spa."
: We get it-
: And more cherries. Here you go. More cherries.
"Gunnie: Oh, awesome."
Barry Syx: No matter what.
Gunnie: Awesome. Hey.
Barry Syx: Just the one hand?
: I'm going to need three more of these.
Gunnie: One hand. One hand. One hand. One hand.
Barry Syx: One hand.
Gunnie: That's it.
Barry Syx: We're done.
Gunnie: We're done. We'll never play again.
Barry Syx: That's it?
Gunnie: That's all.
Barry Syx: One big win.
: Yes. Sir.
: Yes.
Gunnie: Did you find out about those chef's tools?
"Brennan: You see, give me a Persuasion check."
: That's an 18.
: I spoke to our chef. We don't have a formal system for selling our kitchen's tools and implements or utensils.
Lou: Okay.
": By the way, that is the word, is utensils."
Lou: Utensils.
": Cool, cool."
: It's not that the chef is opposed to the idea. We just don't have a means or system of transacting-
Barry Syx: We understand that.
"Gunnie: Yeah, that makes sense."
: But what I can do is find out where we get them from-
: That would be perfect. Can you do that?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. Because obviously, the kitchen is using their utensils, but we might have a supply closet somewhere more."
: That's great.
Brennan: More drinks. Another round of Old Fashioneds?
Gunnie: Another round of drinks.
: And some utensils.
"Gunnie: And some utensils, if you have them, and if not, where we can get them."
Brennan: Amazing. Absolutely. Dealer looks in and says-
": 500, all in. Let's go."
": All right, this is-"
Barry Syx: This is fine. absolutely-
Gunnie: Ball's rolling up. Ball's rolling up. Ball's rolling up.
: Don't use those old fucking die.
Barry Syx: You got this. The ball is rolling flat.
: The ball is rolling up.
: It's not even just rolling up.
Gunnie: We need a big win.
Barry Syx: We need a big win.
: We need a big win.
: We need one.
": Honestly, ball's not rolling up anymore; it's flying, straight up in the air."
: It's up. Ball is up.
Siobhan: I might actually faint.
Murph: Ball is-
Zac: Okay.
Murph: Up.
Ally: My palms are sweaty.
: The ball is up.
"Brennan: I need you to commit to how we're going to do this Box of Doom roll. There's 500 credits riding on the line. We can either have a single straight roll, or we can have two rolls in a row. If it's a single roll, it's going to need to be higher. If it's two rolls, you will need to beat a number twice, but it will be a lower number that you have to beat. You can roll one die. In that case, you have to beat a 13 or higher. You have to roll 13 on the die to beat it."
: Easy.
Brennan: Or you have to beat an eight twice.
Lou: Can I use my Potent Aptitude on this to count cards? Or is it a flat roll?
Brennan: You may use Potent Aptitude to count cards.
"Emily: Yes, baby."
: Okay.
"Lou: Theoretically, I have to choose one creature other than myself. I can't use it on myself."
"Brennan: Okay, so Barry."
: Fuck.
": No, we're letting Murph roll?"
Brennan: One roll.
Siobhan: No.
Brennan: We need-
Lou: One roll.
Brennan: One roll.
Ally: Oh my God.
Murph: Gunnie is full-
Murph: Gunnie. We need a win.
: We need a win. This cements that the ball is rolling up. This says that we're on the track of victory. I'm going to pay off my debt. You're going to kill Barry 09. Our life is going to be perfect.
: Everybody keep calm and Barry on.
Brennan: That is an eight.
: No.
"Brennan: Even with the maximum roll on Potent Aptitude, you would be one away from the number you needed."
: What's the maximum roll?
"Brennan: You watch the dealer pull an Ace and a King, and not even bother dealing out the rest of your hand. Dealer blackjack, dealer wins. 500 credits vanishes."
(whooshing)
: Oh my God.
: Can we have those utensils?
"Brennan: I'm going to need a Deception roll from you, because you counted cards, I'm going to need you to disguise that from the dealer."
Ally: Oh my God.
Lou: And that's a 18.
: Okay.
(Ally laughing)
Lou: Is that guy back yet? Is that guy back?
": Okay, more Old Fashioneds. Here you go. Great. I spoke to our supply manager."
Gunnie: Real question. I'm going to cut it short. Can I have it for free?
(all laughing)
"Gunnie: If I can't have it for free, it doesn't really matter."
Murph: Do you know anyone who will buy a gun? Because there's going to be some people that are-
Lou: I put a gun on the table.
Gunnie: Can we bet this?
: Can we bet a gun?
"Gunnie: I have my light pistol, can I bet this?"
"Brennan: The dealer looks at you and says,"
Dealer: Absolutely. You can absolutely.
Brennan: Roll again.
Barry Syx: How much is this gun worth?
Gunnie: The gun? Hold on one second. Trade this for chips.
Barry Syx: I want to trade the gun for chips.
Gunnie: They're going to be so pissed at us.
"Barry Syx: You're so stupid, Gunnie. We shouldn't have done this."
"Gunnie: No, no. Barry."
Dealer: Is this a light pistol? Okay.
Barry Syx: You know better than to-
"Brennan: You see the look, and the dealer says,"
: Dealer: I can provide a hundred credits for the pistol.
Barry Syx: What about? What about?
"Gunnie: Hey, we turn it around. This is where we turn around. This is where we flip around."
Barry Syx: What about a heavy repeater?
Ally: Oh no.
"Brennan: Heavy repeater? Says,"
"Dealer: Absolutely. If you want to put a heavy repeater up, I can go ahead and give you 400 credits on that heavy repeater."
Gunnie: That's 500 credits.
Barry Syx: We take that and we leave.
"Gunnie: No, no, we double down."
Barry Syx: I'm out.
Gunnie: The ball is rolling up.
Barry Syx: We fucked up.
Gunnie: We take the 500-
"Barry Syx: No, no, no."
"Brennan: The gun, the heavy repeater, and the light pistol move across the table."
: Let me have this already.
"Barry Syx: We fucked up, we fucked up."
"Gunnie: We can double our money. We're going to walk back with double our money and kitchen utensils, and our friends are never going to know."
: This episode's started in a spa.
Gunnie: We're going to buy your repeater back.
Barry Syx: They're already winning.
"Brennan: Barry, I'm going to need that roll."
"Lou: No, I want to roll."
": Oh, you're going to roll?"
Lou: I'm going to roll.
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: Don't use that die.
: Yeah.
Zac: This is-
: I got to beat a 13?
: 13 or higher. Single roll of the die.
Zac: I love this.
"Murph: Do we think that your luck is that much better than mine, that it's worth giving up the five, for the-"
"Lou: Oh, is it? That's a six."
(all laughing)
: Gunnie!
Brennan: I'm going to need-
: I need a ride home.
: This is Margaret's money.
Brennan: I'm going to need another Deception roll from you.
"Ally: ""Oh is it?"""
Zac: He didn't count cards that time.
"Lou: I didn't count cards that time. Unless you let me. Well, it doesn't matter. Unless, no. No, no, no. Gunnie isn't counting cards.He believed in the heart of it."
: Oh my God.
: Oh my God.
"Brennan: If you want, you can count cards on this one, and I will let you make a Technology check-"
: Yes.
Brennan: To roll 2D4.
: Yes.
"Brennan: Okay. First of all, give me a Tech check. We're trying to beat a DC20."
Lou: That's a nat one.
(all laughing)
Brennan: I'm going to need a Deception. I'm going to need a Deception check with disadvantage.
Brennan: That's a 16.
: Is it okay if I lay down on the ground?
Lou: That's a 12.
"Brennan: Okay. You watch your heavy repeater, and you watch your light pistol move across the bar. You watch them move across the bar."
Lou: Okay. I'm going to put up my Vibro-dagger.
Murph: No.
"Lou: I'm going to put up my Vibro-dagger, and I'd like to also put up my tinkerer's implements."
Siobhan: Going to rip this book in half.
": You have to, if we get the 500 back-"
Lou: Yes. Okay. And then that's it.
: We're gonna get the 500 back. The ball is rolling up. Never forget that.
"Brennan: You feel a hand on your shoulder, and you look up and you see that there are two aviator-wearing casino security saying,"
"Security: Hi, sir, is it all right if we have a word with you for a moment?"
"Gunnie: Yeah, of course. What's up?"
Security: Just come with us for a minute.
Gunnie: Yeah.
"Security: Hi, we noticed that you were asking one of the member of the staff about kitchen utensils."
: Yes.
"Security: Understood. We just wanted to talk, because we take security at the casino very, very seriously. What we're going to do is we're going to ask you to leave right now."
Gunnie: What's up? You want me to go? Why?
Security: We detected-
": All one word? ""You want me to go, why?"""
Security: We detected movement in your cybernetic eye.
": Oh, okay."
Security: That was interacting with the hologram interface. We have a very complicated security system.
Gunnie: It's on the fritz. It's acting up.
Brennan: Give me an Insight check.
Lou: That's a nat one.
Ally: No.
"Lou: It's acting up, but it's top of the line. You don't have to worry about anything."
: Lou is not allowed on his own ever as a player.
"Brennan: Barry, you're seeing this conversation happen a little ways away. You give me a Perception check."
Zac: You really just have to let the whole scene wash over you.
Ally: I'm going to really need an inhaler.
: I was ready to trade our guns and cut our losses. I got a fucking four.
: Oh no.
: Amazing.
": Guys, I have brandy in the car it's okay."
"Brennan: They say,"
"Security: Okay, Acme-Ashmun cybernetic eye. Can we get a serial number on that, if that's okay?"
Lou: Yeah. I give it to him.
"Brennan: Okay, give the serial number."
Security: Okay. We're not seeing any report about a break or malfunction on this eye. Do you want to register a report on that eye?
Gunnie: I should. I have a guy. I'll just take it to him.
"Security: Okay, but we need to ask. If there is an issue with your cybernetic eye, we can issue a report on that right now. If we don't, then we're going to have some-"
: Run.
Ally: Oh my God.
"Brennan: You run. As you do, you see one of the guys puts a finger to surveillance and hits, blop. And you see, because you gave them the serial number to your eye, they flag your eye. Over the screen of your eye, you see a big message beacon comes up. It says, ""Notice from Acme-Ashmun. Your loans have been transferred to Repo Reapers."""
Ally: No.
Lou: Gunnie keeps running.
: Cool. You see-
Ally: Repo Reapers.
"Brennan: Repo Reapers. You see, suddenly, plink, plink, plink, plink. Four messages arrive in your inbox immediately. One of them says, ""Welcome to your new Repo Reapers account."" Another one says, with weird tildes and hyphens, in an all caps subject head on the email, ""Where are you?"" Another one underneath that says, ""Repossessing cybernetic limbs."" The one under that says, ""Location needed- urgent."" And then has alarm emojis underneath it."
: We got to-
Murph: I'm running.
Lou: We got to find everyone else.
"Brennan: Cool. So, no chef's tools. You leave from the Emerald Comet, a little bit lighter than when you came in."
Ally: A little bit heavier in the soul.
: What?
Barry Syx: What was with the second play?
Gunnie: You were the first play.
"Barry Syx: Right, the first play."
Gunnie: We needed a big win. You were right.
Barry Syx: We did need a big win. And then it was clear that we were going to lose. This is frankly-
Gunnie: It's not clear. The ball is rolling up.
Barry Syx: The ball is rolling down now.
"Gunnie: No, it's not. No, it's not. It's not rolling down."
Barry Syx: They're going to be so mad at us.
"Gunnie: I can already tell you they're mad at us. I think they transferred my balances to some really, really bad guys. We should probably get off-world, sooner-"
Barry Syx: Right on.
"Gunnie: Rather than later. But hey, things are still looking up, right? We've got this crew."
Barry Syx: This is Barry 09 behavior.
Gunnie: You're not Barry 09. I'm not Barry 09.
Brennan: Where are you going?
: The Arms.
Murph: The hotel.
"Brennan: You're going to the Obfusion Arms? Amazing. Okay. The four of you, up on the"
Ally: Oh my God.
"Brennan: Margaret, spots in your eyes, you can hardly see. There is a collapse. You feel a thud of somebody hitting the bed. The rest of you, what are you doing in this moment? Sid, Skip and Riva."
"Siobhan: Well, I'm cleaning."
"Brennan: Oh, yeah."
"Zac: I mean, if there's an absurdly bright light over there, I guess Skip is like, ""Going to go look at it."""
Emily: I think I'm going to investigate.
Brennan: You see that the light-
Zac: Put my sunglasses down and run in.
"Brennan: You see that the light is fully gone now. As you see that, Margaret, you're trying to get your vision back. You look in the hotel room. The hotel room is rockstar level wrecked. Obviously, whatever telekinetic event was happening in here has taken everything off the wall, flipped the mattress over. Place is in shambles, effectively. Unconscious on the bed is Princeps Zortch, who you recognize. They are a metallic teal-skinned alien. They have some blue, silky outfit, and weird little baseball cap, some jangly jewelry on themselves. And in the center of the room, that fell directly from the center, and thudded, slightly damaging the floor, is what looks like a very heavy, complex silver shape. More reflective than silver, even. It's either chrome or something else. It is a nested series of lined polyhedral telekinetic things. The outer level has thudded into the floor, and the inner polyhedrons are orbiting or gyroing around each other. It's a piece of psychic tech you've never seen before."
Emily: Would you consider it an unfamiliar weapon?
"Brennan: It is- In the right hands, yes. It could be a weapon."
Emily: I touch it and spend a Tech point to have Proficiency with it.
"Brennan: Okay, give me an Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma saving throw."
: Okay.
: Oh.
Emily: It's a nat one on Intelligence.
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: That's a five on Wisdom.
Siobhan: Oh my God. What is going on today?
Emily: And 18 on Charisma.
: Okay. Okay.
: I didn't think it'd be this dire.
"Brennan: Sid, you walk up to it. Hey, good news. You're proficient in this."
: Okay.
Brennan: Getting you out of a nat one. Would that help?
"Emily: Wait, I re-roll nat ones."
Brennan: Your re-roll nat one's Intelligence.
"Emily: Actually, that's a 21 Intelligence."
Ally: And then the other one was a what?
Emily: A five.
Brennan: A five Wisdom.
"Ally: I can heads up and add a D4 to that five, if that would bump us into anything better."
: Okay.
": You can try. Yeah, here you go."
: Two.
Brennan: Two.
"Emily: Okay. It's to seven to 21, seven, 18."
"Brennan: Okay. You do not lose your Intelligence. You don't lose your Charisma. All of your senses are overpowered. You watch Sidney go full neutral. She's having a ground up software update. You're from the ground up, updating your software. In your head, you are seeing flashing images of a quintuple quadrillion terabyte hard drive. Just like-"
": It feels good. It feels good. Everyone, get your hands on this thing."
": Oh my God. No,"
: I hold you back. I hold the captain back.
"Brennan: As it is coming in, a super computer, unlike any you have ever felt before, you are installing drivers on your crystalline consciousness. You succeeded on your Charisma. Had you failed the Charisma save, you think that your ego would have been wiped. Your identity would be gone. You made the Charisma save, so Sid is still here, and you made the Intelligence save, which means that you understand what's happening. It's just that full, ground-up, ""Oh, we can't sense things anymore. No more Perception."" You got a full, hard reboot. Turn the machine off. Sid is off. And Zortch is also unconscious. The thing is installing drivers on you to be able to communicate. That's where you are, as this supercomputer is like, ""Here's all the software you need to even be able to understand what I am."""
"Ally: Who said, ""It's not what it looks like""?"
Brennan: Zortch. The Princeps Zortch. They are unconscious on the lopsided mattress.
"Zac: They said that before they went unconscious, or after?"
"Brennan: Yeah. The were floating in the air. You opened the door, as they were doing some wild psychic thing, and it was creating a ton of electricity and light. And they said, 'It's not what it looks like."" And they collapsed."
"Ally: Can I do a quick Investigation check to see? Since I know her so well, any traces of Lucienne?"
"Brennan: Give me Investigation, and with advantage, if you're looking for Lucienne-specific stuff."
Ally: Okay. That is a 19.
"Brennan: You immediately crack into the Princeps Zortch's phone, and see correspondence with Lucienne. A big wall of text from Lucienne, being like, ""Hey, want to make sure that you're safe. Remember- don't leave the hotel yet. I can't guarantee your safety outside the hotel. Haven't heard from you in about a marbec. Everything okay? Still good for tomorrow?"" Question mark. Question mark. Question mark. Skimming back earlier in that process, there's some care here to not speak over textual interface messages about anything too incriminating, but very quickly you just pick up from the correspondences that Lucienne back-doored Zortch successfully away from Rubian V to get here. And, based on the language Lucienne is using in these texts, you think Zortch got charmed by Lucienne. You think that Zortch is not aware of what a player Lucienne is, that Zortch fully trusts Lucienne."
Ally: Okay. I type back. What do I write back?
Yeah. Still on for tomorrow.
Brennan: Cool. Give me Deception.
Ally: Okay. 21.
Brennan: Amazing. You get an immediate tap back.
Great. Glad to hear it.
"Brennan: Riva, you hear a little pling go off on the dead body of the dude whose body you've folded in half and put into a cleaning cart."
"Siobhan: Okay. Can I, I guess, Psychic Push Pull?"
: You can float-
"Siobhan: Essentially, mage hand."
": Yeah, yeah."
Siobhan: Has flown to me.
"Brennan: You mage hand the phone up. You don't have any tech powers to unlock it, but you see a little text message that says, ""N-C-C-L-C-B."" And then the content of the message is encrypted."
Siobhan: Hmm. I guess I take the phone over to the other room.
Brennan: Awesome.
Siobhan: Because I feel like probably Marge has a better-
Ally: Is this code? Is this UFTP speak?
Brennan: Give me Perception.
(mellow music)
: It's 12.
Brennan: It's not UFTP code.
Siobhan: Can you unlock the phone?
Zac: Can I make a Perception check at the staircase?
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, go for it."
Zac: Those guys there.
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: That's great. That is a 24.
"Brennan: Dude's gone. The hotel security's gone, which means that your time here is pretty- you are not sitting pretty."
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: In the situation that you're in right now.
"Zac: I'm going to run, check out the far staircase, as a way to get out."
Brennan: Mhmm. Yeah. Sid's incapacitated. You have this giant device that-
"Emily: I think when you wake me up, I might know something about the device."
Brennan: And you have the unconscious Princeps Zortch.
"Zac: God damn it. I'm going to run back to where y'all are, and look to both of you and be like,"
": Let's try to get to our room, maybe? Can you carry the Princeps, and we run? And I'll try to push the cart?"
"Zac: Yeah, I try to jostle her awake."
"Brennan: Anyone that wants to, if you want to try to get Sid up and awake again, it's going to be a Tech check."
Ally: Okay.
Zac: I don't think I know what my Tech.
Brennan: You can make a Technology check to try to get Sid to boot back up faster. I would say there's a possibility-
"Emily: I mean, Handy Annie could maybe help with a Tech check."
Brennan: Handy Annie's part of the software reboot.
Emily: Oh. Got you.
"Brennan: With that, I would say you probably don't want to fail this check by 10 or more."
Ally: What do you have to yours?
Zac: Plus four.
"Ally: Okay, I have plus five. So we're looking good."
: Can I help you?
"Brennan: Yeah, you could definitely lend aid. Margaret, you're going to roll with advantage here."
"Ally: Okay. Hey, 18."
"Brennan: Okay. Awesome. I will go ahead and say, on an 18, you can start to boot up Sid a little bit faster. If you have any means of pushing that roll, then it's possible that you could get Sid back up and running right now. I don't know if you still have your Defiant feature."
"Ally: I do, yeah. I still have Defiant."
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: D4?
: Mhmm.
: Three.
: 21? 20 Was the DC. Sid.
"Emily: Sorry, everyone. I just thought that would be a more interesting way to learn about the object."
"Brennan: As you come to, a vast super intelligence that is completely inhuman in character, but your Android consciousness perfectly bridges the gap from what a human being is to what this thing is, because you can tell that it doesn't understand what it's experiencing, but it is experiencing an emotion. And it takes a lot of interpretation to get there, because it is so alien, but you realize that it's experiencing fear."
"Emily: Someone made an artificial intelligence, and it's afraid, and I think that because it's afraid, it's very destructive now. Someone I think made a consciousness, and is irresponsibly not ushering it into this world with any sort of understanding."
: Are you still touching it or touching it no longer?
Emily: Do I get a sense that it would be dangerous for me to keep touching it? I just did it because I thought it'd be more fun than an Investigation check.
"Brennan: For sure. It was more fun for me. Yeah, for sure. Absolutely. Successful. It was very fun. What I would say is-"
"Emily: I probably do unhand it, though."
"Brennan: As you go to unhand it, you see the pieces in it are whirring. You see those pieces go stable, and stop moving. They are still hovering. None of the shapes are spherical. They're all polyhedral, but contained within each other, they were rotating in various orbits and directions, but now are still hovering, but frozen in place. It looks still. It looks more magnetic than anything. As you pull your hand away, you see this computer has a memory of the Princeps Zortch, and an interface with Zortch. Again, this thing doesn't understand what emotions are, but you feel that connection, and feel a sense of attachment to the Princeps Zortch, and you see the last thing that Zortch was trying to do was to communicate to this thing that it is a part of, and somehow also the whole of it being called Gnosis."
"Emily: Gnosis. Starting with a G, I'm guessing."
"Brennan: Yes, it is."
"Emily: Okay. Riva, before we go, are we trying to get Princeps out of here? Because if we are, I can buff myself up, and I can carry them out. But I'm wondering if we try to cast Calm Emotions on this poor computer."
Siobhan: It will only last for a minute.
"Emily: But I mean, think about it. If you're having-"
Siobhan: A panic attack.
"Emily: A panic attack, a minute could really buy you some time to work some things out."
Siobhan: All right. I'll give it a go. I'll try and cast. It doesn't have anything in here about droids or anything. It's humanoids only. Humanoid within a 20 foot radius.
"Brennan: I'm going to say, give me an Insight check."
: All right.
Emily: Yeah. Maybe we can tag team it.
Siobhan: That is a natural one.
Brennan: You got no idea how this fucking thing works.
Siobhan: All right.
"Emily: Okay. Then, do we want to wrap this up in some hotel bedsheets and bring it with us?"
Ally: Yes.
Siobhan: Yeah. I think that that's-
: Yes.
"Siobhan: Let's get out of here, and then we can explain."
"Brennan: All right, Sid roller skates out of here with Princeps Zortch of Rubian V over one shoulder. You've got a big old bed sheet with this-"
: Is it still floating in a sheet?
"Brennan: The object, the outer shape of it, is not floating. It thudded to the ground, but the things inside it, its central casing appears to be affected by gravity, at some times. Margaret saw it floating when she first opened the room door. But it's about this fucking big. It's a hefty device. You got it in a sheet over your shoulder. Riva, you're swimming down the hallway. Margaret, anything else that you're doing?"
Ally: I want the cart with the body in it.
Brennan: You got the cart with the body in it. Incredible.
Emily: I'm going to do one last thing. Can I put a hologram around the bed sheet to make it look like he's holding just a bunch of balloons?
Brennan: Hell yes.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: You got a bunch of balloons. So, where are you going?"
Ally: Our room.
Siobhan: Our room.
: I think go to the ship. I think we're fucked here.
: Yeah. Yeah.
Ally: Yeah.
: Okay.
Ally: Okay.
Emily: Let's skate to the ship.
Brennan: Okay. Couple rolls are going to have to happen. First-
"Ally: Can we take everything when we leave? Obviously, their cell phone, all of this."
"Brennan: Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely. First of all-"
"Emily: Oh, and we've got this fricking person. How the heck are we going to disguise carrying this person?"
: I think we should hide the cart-
Emily: Okay.
: And then leave it.
": Why don't we take the dead body out of the cart, leave it in this room. Put the unconscious body in the cart."
"Emily: Okay, great."
: Disguise the cart.
Emily: The hotel cart and a bunch of balloons.
Zac: Should we pull a fire alarm?
"Emily: Yeah. I press on, on the fire alarm. Let's fucking run."
"Brennan: Fire alarm goes off. Chaos in the hotel. That's going to create advantage. If you're trying to get out of the hotel, I'm going to need a-"
"Ally: Oh, I forgot that I'm a polygot."
"Brennan: Polygot. Yes, yes, yes, absolutely."
Ally: Can I read N-C-C-L-C-B?
"Brennan: It is not a word in any language, but that will allow you to make a Lore check."
": Yes, please."
Brennan: Make it with advantage.
"Ally: Okay, thank you."
"Brennan: It's a contact on the phone. So whatever N-C-C-L-C-B is, it is a saved contact in this transmitter device. It's an entity. It's a person. There's a reason that it's reached out."
"Siobhan: All right. Maybe if we can unlock this phone, we can leave a message."
Brennan: Yes.
: Yeah.
": Do you want to leave the phone with the body, or take the phone?"
Siobhan: I'm worried that the phone will-
: Can you take-
Emily: Oh.
Zac: Take a picture of the content?
": Yeah, let's just grab the number and then leave the phone."
Brennan: To get the number you got to-
Ally: Yeah. Yeah.
Siobhan: Let's take the phone.
: Ditch the phone. Okay.
": Oh, ditch the phone?"
Ally: I think we should take the phone.
Brennan: Cool.
: it could have tracking. It could have GPS.
Brennan: You take the phone.
Emily: Can I do a Tech check to see if it has GPS? If I think it has GPS?
Brennan: Yeah. Give me a Tech check.
Siobhan: Galactic Positioning Service.
: It's 25.
Brennan: Hell yeah. It's got 100%.
: We will be tracked if we take this.
: Is it worth it? Can you unlock it quickly? The fire alarm is actively going off.
Brennan: Give me a Hacker's Kit check. This is going to be Intelligence plus Proficiency plus seven.
": I think, while they are with this, I want to make sure we get ahead-"
Zac: Just start going?
: Yeah.
"Brennan: As you go for it, I'm going to tell you right now, the DC on this is going to be 23, so you got to hit a 16 or higher on the die to unlock the phone right now."
: 16 exactly. 16 exactly.
Brennan: Unreal.
: Finally.
: Woo.
: We needed you at the casino.
Lou: Where were you?
"Brennan: You unlock it. You see it says, ""Just heard back. Coast's clear."" ""Just heard back. Coast's clear. Stand down for the night, but stay in your room and keep your phone on you."""
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: There's hardly any text history here, but you see that the dude, in an early earlier message, like three messages back, is like-"
: Lucienne's fiance.
Brennan: natalia Cicero Connie Lee Carter Bajar.
(Ally and Emily shouting)
Brennan: Hell yes. Hell yeah. There it is.
": Okay. Okay. Fucker. Oh, and she's hot. I take his gross-ass bloody body, put it in the bed, tuck it in and write, ""XOXO,"" on his chest, and leave. And leave the phone."
"Brennan: Incredible. You leave the phone there, amazing. The only thing you're absconding with is the Princeps Zortch and Gnosis."
Emily: And Gnosis.
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me a group Stealth check. The fire alarm is going, but the hotel security that saw you did get away. So I'm going to say it's advantage, disadvantage, it cancels out. It's a flat stealth roll."
: Okay.
Brennan: We just need two of you to pass.
": 22, baby."
Brennan: 22.
Siobhan: Seven.
Murph: 26.
Brennan: 26 and 22.
"Ally: Okay, good, good, good."
Emily: Oh yeah.
: Three.
Brennan: You see Sid with the Princeps over here. You guys are rolling along. You smell something.
(Zac snorts)
"Brennan: You stop. You see an old trash chute. Sid, you can absolutely bust that trash chute open. Get a grappling thing up, and you guys can drop into the Rec Station."
": [All] Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Emily: I really want to cradle Gnosis. I feel so protective of it.
: Let's get the dog.
Siobhan: The dog.
Emily: That's not till tomorrow morning.
Siobhan: Oh God.
Lou: We got to get out of here.
"Emily: I am gonna look for a grenade shop on the way out, because this credit card is going to be gotten rid of."
"Brennan: Okay, we're going to now need a flat luck check, to hope that Gunnie and Barry run into-"
Lou: Everyone or-
Ally: Who's making that?
"Brennan: No, I think I'm going to roll it in front of the board."
Siobhan: Oh God.
: I think I'll call it an even coin flip.
Zac: Hey. Luck's on our side today.
Ally: Yeah.
: Ball's rolling uphill.
"Brennan: The ball's rolling uphill, gang."
Lou: Always.
"Brennan: Okay. 11. You want an 11 through 20, and you don't want a one through 10. That is a nine."
Ally: Oh my God.
Brennan: You head off into the night. And where are you headed? You're headed back to the ship?
"Emily: Back to the ship, but like I said, I do have this credit card burning a hole in my pocket, so if there is somewhere I can buy grenades, I will."
"Brennan: Okay. I'm going to say that at least you head back to the Vale of Tiers, to the same level that your ship is on, and there are grenade stores there. About 45 minutes after that happens, Gunnie and Barry, you walk up to see a throng of people outside of the Obfusion Arms. And you see that there are Rec Pols here. There's fire department here. There's a whole bunch of people. What are you doing as you roll up to this place?"
Murph: We're moping.
Lou: Yeah. We're definitely moping.
: Do you think they did this? Are they in there?
: Maybe. Should we check? Do we have any means of communication that's not longer distance means of communication?
: I think yes. You have means. You can easily contact the ship. I think you can contact the ship no problem.
: Great. I check in with S?
Brennan: SQ is the ship's-
"Lou: SQ. Hey, SQ."
Brennan: Hello.
Lou: Has the captain boarded the ship recently?
: I do not believe that the Skipper has boarded the ship recently.
": Okay, they're not back at the ship yet."
"Brennan: In a metallic raspberry suit with a pair of shades, and extremely shiny, gelled hair, you see Henry Cavill-looking dude walks up. Very square jaw, walks up and goes,"
“Henry Cavill”: Hi gentlemen. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Agent Oscars. I work with a private security firm tasked to Margaret Encino. Are either of you familiar with Ms. Encino?
: No.
: No.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a Deception check.
: Why? Jesus.
Siobhan: No.
: The slowest no.
Murph: 12.
Lou: Nine.
"Zac: Lou, I want to buy you-"
Siobhan: I think you roll worse than Murph.
: I don't want to only buy you new dice. I want to crush your old dice.
: Yes.
Siobhan: I threw them away and he took them back.
"Brennan: You see that this guy goes,"
"“Henry Cavill”: Oh, okay. You're not familiar with Ms. Encino?"
Brennan: And you see takes up a little holo-screen.
: This is you-
: Right on.
: In bathrobes.
Ally: Right on.
“Henry Cavill”: Eating a lovely fruit medley.
Barry Syx: Right.
: And this is you talking to Ms. Encino here. And this is you.
: She told us she had a different name. It was Danny. Danny C.
“Henry Cavill”: Okay. It's your understanding that this woman here is named Danny C.
"Gunnie: Danny C. If you had said Danny C, I would have said, ""Of course."""
: We've just come from the casino and lost a lot of money.
Gunnie: Lost a ton of money. We should head out.
Barry Syx: Should we head out?
: We should head out.
"Barry Syx: Actually, we're worried about missing Danny."
"Gunnie: Yeah, what happened to Danny C?"
"“Henry Cavill”: We're actually, at the moment, very worried about Ms. Encino's safety, so we'd love to have you come and talk with us if you can, about any known persons that have been-"
"Gunnie: We're currently working a gig. We're prepping for tomorrow, so we're actually engaged, but we'd happily come by tomorrow after we're finished with the job."
"“Henry Cavill”: Okay. Understood. Well, thank you for your time."
Gunnie: Thank you.
“Henry Cavill”: And get him. Just get him.
Ally: No.
Murph: I grab Gunnie and run.
Emily: I have weapons.
: I have three guns.
"Lou: And I have my data pad, okay?"
"Brennan: Okay, you see this guy very calmly says, ""Get them."""
Murph: I grab Gunnie and run.
Brennan: Incredible. Okay. You start running out of here as fast as you can. Where are you running to?
Lou: Ship.
"Brennan: Okay, so you're just running straight for the ship."
Zac: Oh my God.
Ally: Oh my God.
: Are you using anything?
"Lou: Yeah, can I cast Flash on them? On whoever's chasing us?"
Brennan: Hell yes. You can cast Flash.
: 6d10.
: Wow.
": One, two, three, four, five, six."
Brennan: Okay. There are four agents right here. Go ahead and roll.
: Eight. Any of them have 33 points of health?
: Three of the agents go down.
: They go blind.
"Brennan: They go blind. Boom. Three go blind. Barry, anything from you? Or you're just sprinting?"
"Murph: I have the Brawny feat, so my carrying capacity doubles, so I assume I can carry-"
"Brennan: Gunnie, no problem."
"Murph: Gunnie, sweet. I'm just going to dash."
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: I'm just going to dash away 60 feet.
Brennan: Incredible.
"Murph: And I guess I'll bonus action, just in case, go into the zone. This is how I go into a rage. So, I put bigger sunglasses on."
Brennan: Cool. You go into the danger zone. I'm going to say this right here. Go ahead and give me a Perception check.
: Why-
: With sunglasses? Does that mean disadvantage?
: Why do you even offer me?
Brennan: Why do I offer you these checks?
": Why do you offer me rolls? Right, that's a 14."
: My king.
": Wait, why does it say two Perceptions? It doesn't make sense."
": Yeah, I don't know why. You must have messed up."
: I must have messed up. I have.
: Cool.
Murph: 14.
"Brennan: Some cybertronic part of Gunnie's arm produces a blinding flash of light, which gives you just enough chance to get away. The main agent you were talking to, appeared to be the leader, is unfazed. However, I'm going to offer something to you. You can have a foot chase through the streets of this level, with the agents chasing after you, if you so choose. However, the rotating tiers of the Rec Station have this artificial gravity on them. Normally, this is traversed with these upsy and downsy-daisies that send people up through the various levels, slowly and safely. It is possible-"
Murph: That I can freaking jump one?
Brennan: You could freaking jump one.
Murph: I do it.
": Barry, Barry."
Murph: We got this.
Lou: The downsy-daisy's over there.
: We're rolling up.
: The downsy-daisy's over there.
Murph: We got this. Hang on.
Brennan: ♪ Highway to the Da-♪
(all laughing)
"Lou: All 4'11"" of me is like- I get underneath Barry's arms, and hooks around his legs, so that he's little."
"Brennan: First of all, I'm going to need-"
Murph: We're the worst duo.
: Oh my God.
Murph: We're the worst.
Lou: We are the Wurst Duo.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me-
: You're the Wurst Duo.
Brennan: I'm going to say it's a DC20 Athletics check to prevent any and all damage from going to Gunnie. Any damage that happens to Gunnie impacts his least cybertronic components.
Murph: All right. Advantage because I'm in the zone.
Lou: I have one more Potent Aptitude.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: So I give that to you.
: Okay.
Brennan: Amazing.
: Okay.
"Lou: And you can add D4, unless you rolled a D4."
Murph: I did not roll the D4 yet.
Brennan: All right. Roll a D4.
: It's got to be a two. You said DC20?
Brennan: DC20. It's got to be a two or higher.
": Oh my God. I'll roll it right here, please. Please, please, please, please."
(all cheering)
Brennan: You will not take...
: That was SO not guaranteed.
: That was deeply not...
Murph: Just confidently narrowly almost dying.
"Brennan: Literally, you're running. You see the agents. You're in upper tier. You know this place is crawling with Rec Pols. If you do a foot chase from here, you're fucked. And you see that the Obfusion Arms, in order to have the best possible view of space, is near the edge of one of the rotating tiers. So you see that again, you're pointing to the downsy daisies, and you just pull a hard left, go towards a shimmering plate glass screen, overlooking the edge, and roll, go into your shoulder. Bear hug Gunnie into your chest. Danger zone."
"Lou: Not too tight, not too tight."
Brennan: And just start cometing down. I got to ask.
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: Are you just trying to go to the next level down? Or are you going straight-
Murph: I'm going to the ship.
"Brennan: Okay, here we go."
Murph: We're going to fall-
Siobhan: Oh my God.
Murph: Wait. How many feet?
: Can you carry him?
Lou: No. Of course not. I have minus two Strength.
"Murph: If I die, just leave me."
Lou: Never.
Brennan: Wait.
Siobhan: Oh God.
"Ally: No, no, no. How many levels? How many levels?"
: Okay.
"Siobhan: Those are candies, right? You're just hungry?"
Lou: He's raging.
: And he's raging.
Lou: He's raging. We're okay.
Emily: Raging is so many points. You have to do 80 damage.
Zac: We were at a spa today.
Ally: Yes.
: We had a dog job to do.
: Is this our worst day of Dimension 20?
: It is our worst day.
: We said that last time. We said that last time.
Emily: We nailed-
: Every day is the worst day.
: We nailed our mission.
Zac: But we're the Wurst crew.
: It's our Wurst day.
: It's our Wurst day.
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Right on.
Ally: Right on.
Emily: Every day is our Wurst day.
: We nailed our mission as well.
: No. Come on.
Brennan: Three. Eight.
"Murph: If I die like this, I'm fine."
Brennan: 35.
: This is the coolest-
: A beautiful jump.
Brennan: 38.
: The coolest jump we've ever had.
: Warrior's death.
Brennan: 58.
: You got to stop soon.
: This is halved. This is all halved.
": No, but..."
: 67 halved… is 33 points of damage.
: I have six health left.
"Brennan: This station has hundreds of tiers. You hit terminal velocity. Something activates on your blast armor, so you are covered in a corona, like something entering atmosphere, as you blast through layer after layer. Fuckin' Danger Zone!"
"Lou: Barry, why haven't we hit yet?"
Murph: I overestimated.
"Brennan: Hundreds of levels down. You're zipping in between. You are dodging neighborhoods. Full neighborhoods, rotating in outer space."
: I regret everything I did today.
"Lou: No, no, you don't."
"Brennan: You smash through the atmosphere core, smash through a plate glass, almost like a Chrysler building-esque top of a skyscraper, go all the way, ricochet off another building, and slam into the ground. Damage is halved, because you were in the zone. You stand up with six hit points left. Gunnie is completely unharmed, exiting from the downsy-daisy. You beat these guys-"
: You can't tell me the ball's not rolling up.
: The ball's rolling up. The ball's rolling up.
Lou: That's my guy. Let's get to the ship.
: I need to go to bed.
Brennan: Okay. You converge back at the ship.
Siobhan: Do they beat us? Did they get there before us?
Brennan: You guys see-
Zac: A comet.
"Brennan: Yeah, a full comet through multiple levels of the Rec Station. Jesus, I feel delirious. Unreal. The amount of swings taken today is unparalleled. Okay. The doors of The Wurst open up. You guys see a message on the ship's comms from Gunnie checking in."
Emily: I do want to have maxed out the credit card at a grenade store.
"Brennan: Okay. If you want to, I'm going to go ahead and actually say finding a grenade store on this level of the Vale of Tiers is not hard. Go ahead and grab those grenades. You have to give me a DC22 Hacker's check to hack the data card that the credits are stored on."
"Emily: I have Proficiency, so that's my Intelligence plus Proficiency."
"Brennan: Correct, yes, yes, yes."
Emily: nat 20\. Finally. Just let me know how much money I can spend on grenades and I'll do it privately on my time.
"Brennan: You do it privately in your spare time, on a nat 20. I'm going to say that there is a sweet 500 credits on that data card."
"Zac: Oh man. With the change they have, we'll be up 800 credits today."
": Oh yeah, exactly. Definitely."
": 910, actually."
Brennan: Incredible.
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: You have 500 credits on that data card. You successfully hack it. Few minutes later, you guys see a critically injured Barry Syx arrive back with Gunnie on the ship."
"Barry Syx: Hey guys, we fucked up."
: Yeah.
"Barry Syx: Multiple people are chasing us, we lost all the money."
: Yeah. They are all-
Barry Syx: That was separate.
Gunnie: There's somebody after us.
"Barry Syx: That was in the casino, after us being irresponsible. But there's also somebody after you."
: You said you weren't going to the casino.
": Well, we decided-"
: The chef's tools.
Gunnie: That was the best place to find chef's tools. And then we had a drink.
Barry Syx: We fucked up.
Gunnie: We fucked up.
Barry Syx: We fucked up.
Gunnie: It was bad. It felt like things were going well.
Barry Syx: We'll give you a proper apology after we leave.
Gunnie: Yes.
Barry Syx: People are looking for you.
: What's the highest that you guys got to?
Barry Syx: Zero. Never anything. The money that we had. I sold my gun.
"Gunnie: Sorry, sorry."
Brennan: You got to for. You did get four.
: We won four. We were up four.
Margaret: 400?
Barry Syx: Up two.
": Two. They gave us a free two. Because we had an Old Fashioned, or a drink. And then-"
Barry Syx: We lost our two guns.
Gunnie: And then we lost our two guns.
Margaret: What?
: We have to leave.
": Okay, yeah."
: Wow.
: Are our ship repairs done?
: Can I have them show me a hologram of who was looking for me? Do I recognize this man?
: Can anyone create a perfect-
Murph: He was so handsome.
Lou: So handsome. Really strong jaw. A ruby red suit. Slicked hair.
: I don't think this person is familiar to you.
Ally: Okay.
: Yeah.
Murph: They were specifically-
Siobhan: Would the uniform be familiar to her?
"Brennan: Those are UFTP agents. That's private security. These are not the soldiers of the United Free Trade Planets. These are the operatives, assassins."
: This ruby red person?
"Brennan: People wearing those raspberry, metallic suits are kill switches for UFTP."
: Incredible. Let's go. Let's absolutely go.
Zac: No dog?
Ally: Yeah. What do you guys think? Is there any way to get the dog on our way out of here?
: I just want to point out that this is going to tank our rating with Smash 'n Grab or whatever it's called.
Lou: We can-
: I don't think we can afford-
Lou: Just circle the block?
: I think we should-
Siobhan: Can Margaret just circle the block?
: I think we should hide in the shadow of a planet.
: They know that we're-
Brennan: Margaret.
: Connected with Margaret. I think it's too late. We have to change the name of the ship again. We just have to change the name of the ship.
Emily: Who votes for hiding in the shadow of a planet?
"Brennan: As Riva says, change the name of the ship again, you realize you are sitting on a potential to cover your trails right now, because the old captain let the registration of the ship lapse. Normally you cannot, middle of whatever, change your ship's registration. That's some pirate shit, right? You're not allowed to do that, but because they're waiting on you to re- register, your registration's fully lapsed, you have an opportunity to change your ship's call sign right now. If you pay that registration fee, anyone that's looking for you on the Red Hot, if you change the name right now, that will update, and there won't be logs for Red Hot."
": Definitely. Yeah, we change it."
Brennan: That's 1200 credits.
Ally: Okay.
: Do we have it?
: Yeah.
: Daddy.
": We just sleep in that ship and tomorrow, we steal the dog. And everything's fine."
Lou: Everything's good. We'll make 25.000-48.000 credits.
Murph: And then no one ever let me or Gunnie be alone ever again.
: Okay.
": Absolutely. I'm never alone, personally, because I can hear everything all the time, that everybody's thinking."
Emily: I think that's what's going on with that Gnosis weird thing.
: Wait. What?
: We found a magical-
Lou: What did you guys do? The hotel was crazy.
"Emily: Well, we went in, we retrieved this unconscious person-"
": Yes, we did."
: They were connected to-
"Siobhan: We stole a hotel cart, which is incidental, but perhaps they would care."
: I unload shampoo and conditioner.
": I think they had a device that helps you know God essentially, or tap into a universal consciousness. And it's maybe irresponsible artificial intelligence, because maybe we don't have the capability to handle that sort of knowledge. But we stole it, and actually he's not holding balloons. That's just a hologram."
"Lou: Whoa, what?"
Emily: I release the hologram.
": Oh. Well that's a little disappointing. Wow. Okay. Okay. Do we know what, who, why?"
: Is there any mark of the manufacturer on this item?
Brennan: Give me a Technology check. Either of you can give me a Technology check.
: Dirty 20.
: 25.
"Brennan: On a dirty 20, you're looking at it. You have a deep connection to this thing that Proficiency granted to it. You're looking at it. You don't see a maker's mark or design on it anywhere, nor do you think there's anything else in the universe like this. And you can affirm that, because as you look at this, on a 25, you are looking at what you understand to be a holofract. A holofract is a machine that serves as a part of something, and also the whole of the thing itself. Actually, do you want to examine this with any tools or-"
: I can get in there. I didn't get to hawk my tinkerer's tools before we got pulled out. I also have my mechanics kit.
": Do I get the impression that, if I touch this thing, the same thing will happen to me?"
": No, you don't think so."
"Siobhan: Like Sid? In which case, can I cast Telemetry on it?"
": Yeah, for sure. And just get a sense of where it's been, and its past."
": You choose one object that you touch throughout the casting of the power. If it's an enhanced or modified item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement, how many charges it has. And if the item was created by a power, you learn which power created it."
: You touch this and find its properties.Its properties are endless. This is a super-intelligence that you believe it's hard to put a capon what this could do in skillful hands. This could-
"Siobhan: World ender, world creator-"
"Brennan: Kind of thing. It's possible that if this was attached to a powerful enough transmitter, it could completely dampen all communications throughout the galaxy, rendering space travel impossible, and orphaning every single world in the galaxy in an instant. It's also possible that it could completely copy and share all information, making everything readily available everywhere. It could probably design perpetual motion if it wanted to. You see all of that, and you also see again, its attachment to the Princeps Zortch. You get your tech stuff in it and look at it."
: Do I need to ask for permission?
: Yes.
: May I?
: The supercomputer doesn't appear to have sensory apparatus to know that it's being asked for this.
"Emily: Well, it's good manners anyways. I hand it over."
Zac: How's the Princeps doing?
: Breathing. Stable. Just unconscious.
: Can we tuck them in?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can put them in a little work area. For sure."
"Siobhan: Can I also use then Telemetry on the Princeps? Because if I am touching a creature, you learn what psychic powers, if any, are currently affecting it."
"Brennan: Yes, the Princeps is under the Stunned condition. and it is a psychic power that manifested from its interactions, or from their interactions with Gnosis. A holofract is a concept you're familiar with in theoretical computing, which is basically that, much like how if you cut a piece of something that can create a hologram, it still creates the full image, just smaller. This appears to be a partial fraction of a much larger thing. And you're looking for what its manufacturing is. You think the genesis of this may have been synthetic. It may have started as artificial intelligence. When you look at the maker of this holofract, this is an organic computer. This computer grew. And you think that the thing that it was cut from, the thing that this is a piece of, and what its power really and truly is as a sentience that carved itself out of raw materials, a Silicon-based super-intelligence, if you had to guess the size of what this thing comes from, what its actual corpus was, probably about the size of the moon."
: Rubian V?
"Lou: This is just a small piece of something much bigger, that's out there."
Emily: I think we need to find it and reunite it.
: Isn't it that moon that we just came from?
: I have a defibrillator. Can I use that on Princeps Zortch?
Brennan: Zortch? Yeah. Go for it.
: Great. I'm going to go fully defibrillate them.
: It's not what it looks like.
: What does that mean?
Zortch: I just didn't want you to think I was fucking the computer.
"Margaret: Now, that only makes me think you were fucking the computer."
Zortch: No. I know.
: Can I do an Insight?
Brennan: Yeah.
": Yeah, can I do an Insight?"
: I got a 13.
: A 16.
: They have complicated feelings about how good it felt to interact with the computer. Okay.
Zortch: I was not fucking the computer.
Gunnie: It's okay.
Zortch: I was not fucking the computer.
: Did I fuck the computer?
: No. But how did it feel?
: Really good.
"Zortch: It feels really good, right? So, it's a complicated thing, because you're just trying to communicate, and it just feels really good."
: Better than Pleasure Putty.
Gunnie: Welcome to The Wurst.
"Zortch: Yeah. Where am I, and who are you?"
Riva: We're The Wurst.
: Crew.
"Margaret: I'm from UFTP. I'm UFTP,"
Ally: And I show my badge.
"Zortch: Oh my God. Wait. Okay. So, I hurt myself interacting-"
"Margaret: You slept through your alarm. It's the morning. No mimosas, sorry."
Zortch: Oh. Shit. Okay. Is Lucienne coming or no?
Margaret: It's me instead. Hi. I'm Margaret Encino.
"Zortch: Hi, Margaret. How's it going?"
Margaret: What did you think of Lucienne?
: I thought-
Margaret: What did you think about her?
Zortch: I thought she was nice.
"Margaret: Yeah, she's super nice. She's super nice."
Brennan: What's the energy I'm getting right now?
"Ally: Oh, I'm just wondering. You know someone so well, and you just, ""How does that outside world see this person?"" That's really interesting info."
: Okay.
: I give them a glass of water.
": Well, thank you."
"Margaret: The plan is changing, so we're just going to take you with us."
Zortch: Am I being kidnapped?
": No, no, no."
: Can I leave?
: No.
Gunnie: It's a very dangerous situation.
Margaret: Yeah.
: I think we should be honest. You are being kidnapped. But I think that you'll be on our side by the end of this conversation.
Margaret: Wow. Master manipulator.
: I'm sorry. Your lies were so obvious.
": No, it's true. I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Zortch: Okay.
Skip: My name is Norman Takamori.
": Okay. I need to meet with Lucienne. I had a ball. It was like a silver ball. It was not quite a ball, but it was you know?"
Margaret: What kind of significance does that have to you?
Zortch: It's my birthmark.
: Excuse me? It's your birthmark? It's not the computer you were fucking when I walked in through the door?
Zortch: Right. I already talked about that.
"Riva: Now, I am a psychic, but you don't have to be to know that that is, as the humans say, bologna."
: Balani?
"Riva: Bologna. Bologna. It's actually spelt completely different from bologna, which I find fascinating."
: Bologna.
Riva: A city in Italy. Not pronounced like that.
Zortch: The important thing is this: I am a member of the Royal family of Rubian V.
Margaret: Oh.
"Zortch: And actually, I am going to need my computer. I'm going to need my computer back."
Margaret: And then what? What are you going do?
": Actually, you're under arrest."
": Oh. Hey, why are you laughing? Are we flirting? No. Should we get out of here? We're still at the dock."
: I think that we should get out of here.
: We changed the name.
": Yeah, we changed the name. We're going to hang out."
": No, we can’t change. We look like a freaking huge hotdog."
: You wanted to just go back-
Gunnie: Talk about the block. Hide on the other side of the moon.
: We need to leave the dock and hide in the shadow of a planet.
"Brennan: Go ahead. Anyone that wants to can make an Investigation check for me, to determine your exposure."
Emily: 15.
Ally: Great.
Siobhan: 17.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Can I do it? Never mind.
Ally: 19.
"Brennan: 19\. Determining your exposure. You used your card to get a room for everyone at the Obfusion Arms, and to get massages for everyone there."
: Mhmm.
Murph: Right on.
: You used your card to get those resources for everybody.
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: In terms of who people saw, they have all of you guys talking, but once you guys got to the 28th level, all the cameras go dark. Once the cameras go dark, the only thing that hotel security sees is Sid and Norman. You're never spotted by any security up there. It's a risk. There's a possibility that the agents are asking after you, because they are legitimately worried for your safety. The agents that came after Barry and Gunnie. Clearly, some stuff is going on. If Lucienne actually gets alerted, and someone connects to her, like, ""Hey, did you know that Margaret Encino is also staying at the Obfusion Arms?"""
Ally: Then it would tip.
Brennan: Then it would tip.
Ally: Okay.
": But if that connection hasn't been made, they may just be like, ""Margaret was with people in the spa. And then later, those people attacked the Princeps Zortch."" And some hotel security."
": Okay. I think, then, I will just completely level with the Princeps and be like, ""Okay, this is all of our past history with Lucienne, throw that out the window."""
Zac: All of ours?
"Ally: Everybody, every single person."
: She's in love with-
"Margaret: She's a bad person. And then, if I have to pull up emails and stuff too, I can use that, but just, she wants to squash the rebellion on your moon. She wants to kill you."
"Zortch: No, she doesn't."
Margaret: She's bad.
"Zortch: No, she doesn't want to squash the rebellion."
Margaret: What does she want to do?
"Zortch: She told me she organized a safe passage for me, away from this. I don't know if I can trust you guys."
: Okay.
"Brennan: They look out and say,"
Zortch: I'm sorry. I don't know if I can trust you.
"Sidney: I also connected with your computer, and I also don't know if I fucked the computer or not. So, we're both living in that ambiguity. It's really beautiful, and I think that I want to do whatever is in the interest of this computer that I might have made love to."
"Margaret: I'm Reddit user Hotbox420. This is my body. Oh, sorry, and then this is the previous post that I posted about the rebellion."
: You?
"Brennan: Actually, I would like both of you to make Persuasion checks with advantage."
: Okay. I also haven't even used my Sage Advice yet. Okay.
Brennan: Amazing.
Ally: Persuasion?
Brennan: Yeah.
Ally: 20\. Not nat.
"Brennan: Cool. You know how to turn this computer on. You have that ability. Gunnie and you both arrived at the same conclusion, based on your earlier Tech checks. This thing is incredibly powerful, but what it did, where it was fully on and sentient, requires a pretty intense energy source. What was going on in that room is not sustainable. If you wanted to hook this up, the ship is a fucking star ship. It has plenty of energy to run this holofract. But you would need to interface. To turn this back on, it's going to need more juice. Its internal batteries have run out. But-"
"Emily: I think I'm just trying to level with them. I believe in whatever this tech is, and I also think it's really powerful, and I would like to safeguard it from the wrong hands. So that's me trying to extend an olive branch to say, ""You know, maybe our intentions are aligned."""
": They register what you're saying is true. They smile and go, ""Okay."" And they look over, see you holding your phone."
: It's a photo of me. That's a photo of me.
"Brennan: They say, ""You are Hotbox420?"" They take your hand, kneel in front of you and kiss your hand."
": And then I show them the email. We know she just said it. Never mind. I don't have written proof, but-"
Brennan: You don't have proof.
"Ally: I'm telling you right now, Lucienne is evil. Lucienne is marrying into-"
: I think they want this tech for something bad.
: Yes.
"Brennan: My parent, the Monarch of Rubian V, they found out about Gnosis, and they found out that our planet, our moon had arrived at this super consciousness. There was a artificial intelligence that was made probably about 15, 16 cycles ago, that was made by scientists working for my parent on Rubian V. They developed an artificial intelligence that was supposed to help our people, help our civilization. It was originally an intelligence that was supposed to aid communications. There's been so much strife on Rubian V. Obviously, the war that my grandparents fought in, which was where the contracts with the United Free Trade Planets were signed, and communications disintegrated so much, and they were basically making an artificial intelligence that was supposed to be a helper for us to communicate with each other. In creating the computers for that, they had developed a technology that would tap into the innate power sources of Rubian V. As you know, our home world is a prized resource for that exact reason."
Ally: All the lithium at its core.
": Because of the composition of the planet, the machinery that the code was using to write itself began to draft its own software, and very rapidly its own hardware, building its own physical structure, at first within computers, but it got out and it started drafting itself into the landscape and eventually into the core of the planet. Our moon has become sentient, and not only sentient, but a super-intelligence."
": So, it's not lithium rich inside that's being mined? That is a being?"
": The being's consciousness, it permeates the world, and as UFTP has continued to mine out the core of our moon, the substance is being taken away. Gnosis seems to be able to rewrite itself without losing any of its consciousness, even as so much mass is moved out of the core of our home world. It still exists, and like you're saying, it can create this holofract. It's not a one- to-one ratio, the physical space that the consciousness needs, and the fullness of the consciousness. However, if the home world were to collapse, if-"
Ally: This is like a seed?
": I had to get it off. I had to get it off my home world. And my parent, they want to rebel against the United Free Trade Planets, because they think that they can harness Gnosis, and Rubian V can become the heart of a galactic empire. And so, I told Lucienne about Gnosis. I told her, and she said that she would be able to stop my parent from doing that. And so, she said,"
"""Come to Rec 97, bring the holofract. We'll work all this out, and we can save Gnosis together."""
": Right. She completely lied to you. I will be able to prove this to you somehow, because I know in the very near future, she's going to be extremely angry at me, and I can show you that, so if you just hold with us for a little bit longer."
": We don't have that phone, right?"
Ally: The dude's phone? We don't have the guy's phone. Does she have any sort of a tracker on your phone or Gnosis that you know of?
": No. I only got to the Obfusion Arms about two malton units ago, if that."
: We should check anyway. This Lucienne is...
: Yeah. Can I do a Technology check to see if I'm getting any sort of tracker on there?
Brennan: Go for it.
: Okay. 15.
": You're not picking up a tracker on them. You see that the Princeps Zortch touches around on their clothes and says,"
"""Oh, shit. My phone."""
And you realize that their phone is probably on a nightstand back in the Obfusion Arms.
Ally: I think grabbed it actually.
Siobhan: Margaret grabbed it.
Brennan: You grabbed the Princeps' phone?
"Ally: Yeah, because we were looking at it, and it was,"
"""Still on for tomorrow?"""
"""Yes, we're still on."""
"Brennan: Yes, that's absolutely correct. Yes, the Princeps goes,"
"""Oh, thank God."""
Emily: Can I disable location?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
": Yeah, yeah."
: You disable that. Boop boop. It's gone.
Ally: Cool.
": The Princeps looks and says,"
"""This is a lot to take in."""
"You see that they start to cry these really viscous, gooey tears that come out of their eyes and they go,"
"""I'm not good at this stuff. I don't know how to trick people. And I just wanted to save Gnosis."""
Emily: I think you did absolutely the right thing.
: Yeah.
: You did awesome. We're all really bad at talking to people.
: I'm rubbing their back.
: Yeah.
: You're going to fit in awesome here.
: We've got a coworking space.
": I hope you're the good guys, because I'm just trusting pretty much everybody."
: Right on.
Lou: Want to watch a movie?
: Okay.
Lou: We got some good movies downstairs.
: Great popcorn.
": They take Gnosis in their arms and hold it, and they watch a movie."
Ally: Yes.
: Can we talk real quick while they watch the movie?
": Yeah, absolutely."
": ""We're family, we're family."""
": What the hell are we doing? That's a super computer, and the UFTP wants that. It just feels like a lot."
": It feels like if it gets into the wrong hands, then there's going to be some kind of-"
: We can't-
: Catastrophic event.
: Leave them here.
"Lou: Sorry, that's my alarm clock. I have tutoring later."
": Okay, no, we have to keep them. But do we still figure out what to do with the dog?"
": I think we can have our cake and eat it, too."
: We're on a kidnapping spree.
"Ally: We've lost a lot of money today, so we do have to do the dog."
": And I will just say, if we were going to do cuts or anything, my cut is going to replace the 500 that we left. So, I'll kidnap the dog for free."
": That's very noble of you, Barry, but you don't have to do that. We'll split."
: The maths on that is absolutely incorrect.
: We'll split. We'll each sack 250.
Siobhan: Do we have disguises in the ship? Because I feel like people have seen us.
"Emily: Let's think about where to put our ship first. Again, I just feel like the shadow of a planet is a really good place to hide."
: Does the escape pod work? Can we fly the escape pod off and fly the escape pod back?
"Emily: No, because then they'll ransack our ship and we just got it fixed."
": You have a message from Mona, who was working here, being like,"
"""Escape pod was a little bit trickier. Couldn't get to it today. We will grab it first thing in the morning. We'll be ready for you by the time you disembark."""
: Ask her if she wants to buy some Pleasure Putty. She just looks a bit lonely.
": Thanks, Mona. Sounds great. Yours...Gunnie."
PSiobhan: would you want some Pleasure-
"Ally: Yes, Captain."
: Would you want some Pleasure?
: Honestly?
": What the hell, Skip?"
"Brennan: You get a response back a few seconds later, being like,"
"""Sure."""
"Lou: Thanks, Skip."
: Okay.
": Okay. Guys. We should stay. We should stay. I might have a date. Later, later."
": It's movie night. You see the Princeps watch that movie. Barry's badly injured. You guys take a long rest. The next morning, the Rec Station obviously has a little bit of like a malton unit cycle, where it changes the quality of its artificial light, just because there's enough species that have circadian rhythm. That's a little bit helpful to change the light color gradient on the light in the Rec Station. As that occurs, you all arise. You've got enough time to get up to Blue Heaven before the Carbine Kennel Club dog show."
Emily: I'm going to go in on that freighter.
Lou: Yeah.
Emily: Bypassing the-
: The person-
Emily: Yeah.
": You guys see the Princeps walks up and is eating some strawberries from the kitchen. Looks around and says,"
"""Hey, so sorry. I made some French toast with some creme freche. Just a breakfast with-"""
: What?
Emily: What tools? With what tools?
: We have chef's tools?
Emily: We have chef's Tools?
Brennan: There's a ton of utensils in the kitchen.
Ally: Incredible. Okay. This is kind of a stretch.
"Brennan: There's a big box that says, ""Jib-Job,"" and it says, ""Utensils."""
Murph: Utensils. We were looking for chef's tools.
: We were looking for chef's tools.
"Lou: Yes, it was utensils. They told us that before we had to run away."
: Do you want to go on a dog napping mission?
Ally: Yes.
Brennan: Yes.
: Really?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: Okay, come."
Brennan: What's a dog?
"Ally: Oh, incredible. You're going to learn so much today. We want to show you how much you can trust us. Come with us for a day in the life."
Zortch: They always said life outside the palace would be nuts. This is fun.
"Lou: I'll tell you, it is. You get out and it is crazy."
: Yeah.
Lou: It's going to be fun. You're going to have a great time today.
"Ally: We're going to have to leave Gnosis here though, because that computer could be snatched from us when we're in the outside, I think."
Murph: Do you guys feel like leaving it unattended?
: What if we just duct taped it to me really tight?
: I think it's a good idea to it-
: That I couldn't even be disarmed.
: What about balloons?
: It's this big. Isn't it this big?
: It's large.
"Lou: I mean, this will be quick, right?"
": Yeah, so fast."
Emily: We can't lose this.
"Zac: So fast, so easy. Let's go."
: I feel like-
: Just tape it to Sid.
: I say we tape. It's the most-
: Let's go. We're taping it to Sid. Let's move.
Lou: Is Raymond around?
Brennan: You guys are supposed to alert the Jib-Job workers if you guys have a scheduled departure.
: Let's get Raymond to watch it.
: I don't trust a random Jib-Jobber with-
: It's not a random Jib-Jobber. It's Raymond.
: Raymond has a thirst for adventure.
Murph: What is Raymond going to do if that Henry Cavill-ass dude shows up with a blaster?
": Use the ship's correspondence to let you know that we're under attack, and then you zap back to your body?"
Brennan: That would work.
": I mean, that works for me."
Murph: All right. Should we put it to a vote?
Lou: Sure.
: All for duct taping it to Sid?
(Emily laughing)
Ally: I'm the same.
"Brennan: And then all for leaving it with Raymond Zam on the ship. Amazing. You got a thing, and you see Raymond."
"Emily: When you stop trying to please people, you realize how much they displease you."
: Oh my God.
"Brennan: Raymond hits you back and says,"
"Okay, do we have a scheduled departure for when Jib-Jobbers should be back on ship?"""
: I think by about 10:00 AM this morning.
"Brennan: Okay. He says,"
"""Great. I'll let everyone know that we're having a scheduled departure at 10:00 AM."""
"Brennan: And you see, a couple of minutes later, Raymond shows up, got his nice little crisp sweater vest. And he goes,"
"""Hey Gunnie, how's it going?"""
"Gunnie: Hey, good to see you, man. We'll be headed out soon. We're going to go take care of one more thing. We're leaving some real precious cargo that was sent by Jib-Job Corporate. Just make sure if anyone tries to touch it, comes anywhere near it, give us a call."
Raymond: Sure. Do you want me to put it in one of the file cabinets where we keep the Jib-Job stuff?
Gunnie: You can leave it out.
"Brennan: Okay. So you see a deific planetary supercomputer rests on a coffee table, next to a bowl of fake fruit."
Emily: Wait a second.
"Brennan: Raymond Zam sits there, and is like,"
"Raymond: All right, you guys have a good one."
Emily: I think we should put it in the bathroom under the sink. No one would look there.
Murph: Unless they hated toilet paper.
Lou: But they probably wouldn't-
Murph: It would just make sure it stopped.
: Exactly I don't think if somebody-
Zac: Skip sprints out of the plane.
Brennan: We leave. We're done. You guys walk away and you see-
"Ally: On my way out, I go to Raymond and I go,"
"Margaret: Losing this would be the biggest deal ever, professional to professional."
Raymond: Okay.
Margaret: This is a really big deal. We really like the work that you've done here so far.
"Raymond: Great, yeah, yeah. Do you want this under the sink or do you want it on the coffee table?"
Margaret: I want this wherever you're going to be able to see it. So it could be under the sink if that's where you go.
Raymond: Probably coffee table.
"Margaret: Yeah. Great. Okay, cool."
Ally: Firm handshake. Just the firmest handshake.
Zac: Can I pull Raymond aside for 25 minutes?
Siobhan: There's French toast in the kitchen.
"Brennan: Ooh. Raymond has never reacted stronger to anything. It's amazing. He says,"
Raymond: I saw the email. We're upgrading to full kitchen. Okay. Jib-Job!
: Rallying cry. Jib-Job!
Ally: Jib-Job!
Brennan: Great. All right. You see Raymond. Raymond walks in. You guys all head up. You grab the freighter truck. I'm going to roll.
Zac: We might not get the money.
Ally: Why?
Lou: We're supposed to meet at the hotel.
Murph: We can send a message.
Brennan: You guys recall that Hyacinth Khrome is going to be at the dog show.
: Right.
"Brennan: If something's gone sideways, there's a potential to fix it there. You guys get in the truck. The truck driver looks over and says,"
Blue Heaven. Huh?
: Right on.
: Price has gone up since yesterday. That's going to be 40 credits.
Riva: I've got it guys. I've got it. I've got it. Would you take it in Pleasure Putty?
: No.
Riva: I understand. I understand.
Brennan: All right. You toss over a cool 40 credits. Up you go.
: Yes. Yes.
Brennan: A Luck check.
(upbeat music)
: This is all great.
Brennan: You feel the truck stop. Hear the noise of some Rec Pols outside. You see the back of the truck gets knocked on. Sound stops. Goes away. Truck continues on.
: Ball's rolling up.
"Brennan: The truck pulls up to The Dome, the ritziest, poshest club in all the Blue Heaven level. This is the crown jewel of Rec 97. You see there are full red carpets rolled out. This is a full gala of the Rec's biggest and best dog owners. How do you approach once you're let out of the truck?"
: Can I get an Insight or just an Investigation?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Ally: I have forgery kit. Can I forge myself an entrance to the thing, and walk around looking like I've lost my dog?"
Brennan: Yeah. Give me a Forgery check.
: 17 Perception.
Brennan: Cool.
: 18 Investigation to figure out what the situation is.
: And I got a dirty 20 Insight.
Brennan: Amazing. What's that?
: Fail.
: Fail. Fail-
Zac: I got 11 Perception.
"Brennan: 11 Perception. Fails here. 20 Insight. The vibe here is a little bit like this might just be a Smash 'n Grab. You see there is security here. There is Rec Pol around, because there's all these highfalutin people here, but also you're so deep in Blue Heaven at this point that you're in the level of ritzy where the ritzy people don't want to see the things protecting them. It's like, ""No, no, I don't want a Marine with a huge rifle at my dog show. No, no, no. That stays at the borders."" Here, everything is lush and positive and nice. So, there's not too much security around. There's some other androids. There might be a Vercadian protector here or there, but that looks like private security. That looks like if you don't fuck with that person, then their droid won't mess with you."
Siobhan: And do I see this weird hairless dog?
Brennan: On a 20 Insight. Did anyone get above a 15 Perception?
Lou: 17.
Brennan: 17\. You're looking around for your person. You're looking for-
Ally: Aurora Nebbins.
Lou: Milo.
Brennan: The name of the owner-
Ally: Is Milo?
"Brennan: Is Myalor Nabthacks. And you're looking for Aurora Nebbins, a royal blue Mastiff."
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: You never heard of a Royal blue mastiff? A freakish 20 foot long monster. A blue weasel with bulbous solid yellow eyes, and teeth both in its mouth and protruding from the exterior of its mouth. Some on the outside of its lips. It has a huge ship's chain around its neck and goes..."
(Brennan shrieks)
And just claws at the ground. And you see there are a couple of androids holding it in place. It is a space monster.
Lou: Is the trucker gone?
Brennan: Trucker's gone.
: I think that's it.
": Very good, Aurora. Very good."
"Emily: If we slapped a tattoo on that thing right now, it would lose, and we would have got it."
"Siobhan: No, no, no."
Ally: Oh my God.
: I think we have to find out how people are judged. Because what if-
"Murph: We need to make sure it's not in the show, though. I think it's not about whether it wins the show or not. Look, I can carry that thing."
"Siobhan: I was going to say, I actually think I can too."
: Yeah.
Lou: Okay. So between two of you-
: Put the gunners on it.
Lou: You get hands on it.
: I think that we can carry it.
: Gunner channel takes that. How much time do we have until the dog show? Can I ask a passerby? How much time until the dog show?
Brennan: About 18 martrons.
: Okay. 18 martrons.
: Oh my God. 18 minutes.
"Emily: I think, if you all can create a distraction, I can enhance droid double my carrying capacity, and the two of us can carry this thing away."
Ally: Do we have to incapacitate it first? It'll be wailing all over.
"Brennan: You see it coils up and hisses and spits venom into a dude's face. And its owner's like,"
"""Beautiful dog."""
Ally: Oh my God.
Lou: I can blind it. That's the best I can do.
Ally: No.
"Siobhan: I can calm its emotions. That might work. It's not humanoid. I can't, because it's not fucking humanoid."
: What if we-
": Wait, go ahead."
"Murph: You have an idea, Skip?"
: What if we break its legs?
"Murph: It definitely isn't the type of dog I was thinking of. I'm more open to breaking this thing's legs, but I don't want to."
": Skip. Hey, I love that enthusiasm. Maybe we just let it loose. Is that a thing? It looks like-"
: The 25K to have it not compete.
": But what if we let it attack the handlers, and it attacks a bunch of people and murders them. And then it can't compete."
: I don't know if that's included in the judges' eyes.
: They just said beautiful when somebody had acid spit in their face.
"Lou: Okay, maybe you're right."
Ally: What were you just saying?
: What if we give it steroids?
"Lou: Do you have steroids on you, Barry?"
Murph: I think I just had them naturally pumped into my body when I was born.
Brennan: Welcome one and all to the 78th Cyclical Carbine Kennel Club dog show.
Ally: Okay.
Murph: What do the androids look like? Can we just-
Ally: I cast Critical Analysis on the-
Brennan: Announcer?
"Ally: No, no. Sorry. On the-"
Brennan: Dog?
Ally: On Aurora.
"Brennan: On Aurora Nebbins. Yes, absolutely."
"Ally: Yes. And so then, I can use my Intelligence modifier. I would like to choke it out."
"Brennan: So, let me get it clear."
": Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
"Brennan: On the dais entering the space, you're going to run up and choke out a weasel, about as large as an elephant."
Lou: 20 feet.
Siobhan: The CIA is after you.
Ally: But where are we? I thought we were backstage.
"Brennan: No, no, no. You're just out on the curb, looking at the entrance dais to The Dome."
: Eyeball. How much does this thing weigh?
Brennan: Maybe north of a ton.
Murph: Okay. My carrying capacity is doubled. Your carrying capacity is-
Emily: I can make mine doubled.
Lou: So what would that be?
Emily: What is normal carrying capacity?
: Calculate carrying capacity?
Brennan: A ton is 2000 pounds.
Zac: Can we hack the androids?
Emily: Is it androids taking care of it?
Siobhan: Yeah. There's two androids.
"Brennan: Also, for those that got Perceptions and things like that, this is very public. This is the red carpet. Going inside, the grooming areas are more sequestered."
Ally: That's where I thought we were. Totally. We can wait until we're there.
": Do they look like there's any guards that are by themselves, that we can knock out?"
": If you can actually knock out the androids, I might be able to make the dog hallucinate so badly that it runs away."
"Emily: Okay. Then, you know what? I actually have a grenade that disables electronics within the blast radius, and they need to be rebooted."
"Lou: Are we doing this here, or should we go inside? I think that's the question."
"Ally: We go inside, obviously. Yeah."
Brennan: Amazing. You go up to the front. You see security sort of checking people in.
Emily: I'm not even trying to go in the front way. I want to just sneak in.
: There are-
Murph: Probably handlers. You did a forgery check and it was bad.
: And it was bad. But can I try again?
: You can go to talk to security if you want.
: Right. I would love to.
: Is anyone not trying that? Is anyone going to go find a servant's entrance to the club or something?
Zac: I'd love to try to Stealth in.
": Yeah, I'd like to try to Stealth."
Brennan: We have two stealthers here. Who's going with?
"S: I'll go with Margaret and I'll use Calm Emotions on us, so that anybody within a 20 foot radius is not hostile to us."
Lou: I'm going to give Margaret Potent Aptitude.
Brennan: You're all going with Margaret to the front.
Murph: Yeah. I'm going to go with Margaret.
Brennan: Okay. Four of you go. Let's do stealth over here.
: nat 20.
: 21.
: 21.
Emily: nat 20 becomes 26.
"Brennan: Amazing. Sidney, you skate away and you see there's a weird joint pop as well, from the Captain. And I think the captain can move like an animal if he wants to, a little bit. Incredible. You go through the back."
"Emily: I think with my nat 20, can I look for a huge secret exit? Wherever I go in, I'm looking for a place that we could smuggle this dog out."
"Brennan: Oh, hell yeah. There's a back loading dock."
": Yeah, okay."
Brennan: You go to a loading dock. As you scoot in-
Emily: I cast Off on the garage thing.
Brennan: You cast Off on the garage. So it's easy. You just go in. There's servants back here that don't super care about stopping anybody. You guys just hug to the shadows. You see the thing that you hit Off on. Give me-
Emily: Technology?
"Brennan: No, give me a Charisma saving throw."
: God. Seven.
"Brennan: Okay. It's all good. You hit Off. As you walk through, though, it looks like there's certain things back here. Skipper's unaffected, but there seems to be some anti-android stuff back here. Nothing that you can't handle. As you skip through, it scans your ID chip. Your serial number."
: Can I do a Deception or something?
"Brennan: Yeah, give me a Deception."
: Think of a different… Oh God. Five.
"Brennan: You go to try to stop it. This is normally not a problem for you, because you're not registered anywhere. So, normally, android things can't pick you up, because you're a prototype. You were never put on the market. You don't even really have your barcode, because you never were for sale. Your line never got printed and made."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see a little thing go boop, and there's an out of order thing. There's an error message. And then it comes up and says, ""Whitney."""
Emily: I knew it was going to happen. I knew it. I fucking seethe in my fucking roller skates.
"Brennan: And it registers the error. It goes boop boop, Whitney. And then it goes away. You both are in the back of the club though. You make it. But you do know that that got filed somewhere. Everybody else, you are at the front. Margaret, you approach security."
: Hi. Yes. I would like to charm this person.
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
: That is my Persuasion versus your Insight. That is a 17.
Brennan: A 17. This person says hello.
Margaret: Hi.
Security: Hi.
Margaret: I'm checking in. And this is my entourage.
"Security: Oh, understood. And what name would that be under?"
Margaret: My name is Danny C.
Security: Danny C. I'm not registering a Danny C. I'm so sorry.
Margaret: Really? Wait.
Security: I’m not registering a Danny C. This might be my mistake though.
"Brennan: You can see that it's working on them to some degree. They look very much in the space of very important people come here who maybe fucked up their own credentials. Riff raff wouldn't be here. When there's a mistake like this, this person is apologetic, rather than suspicious."
Ally: Got it.
": Danny, we really need to get inside."
Margaret: I know. I know.
: We really need to get inside.
Margaret: I know.
Security: Is it possible that there could be another name that this was under? How large is your party?
"Margaret: Let's see, it's what? One, two, three, four."
: That's it.
: And.
: Oh.
: The Princeps. Six of us.
"Security: I see it says, oh, party of six. Oh, wonderful. Could it possibly be under Callister? Could it be under Rogers? Could it be under Salazar?"
: Yes. It's definitely under Salazar.
"Security: Okay, party of six for Salazar. Perfect."
"Brennan: And prints out a bunch of passes and says,"
Security: Should I hold onto the sixth one until your last guest is here? Or would you like to hold onto this yourself?
"Margaret: Oh, we'll hold on to this ourselves. Thank you so much."
"Security: Of course, of course."
: I'd like to use Subtle Control to wipe this person's mind of that happening.
Lou: Incredible.
: They have to make a Wisdom saving throw.
"Brennan: As you walk past, they look up and go, a little confused, like they don't know what just happened, but then they go back to their job."
Ally: Incredible.
Lou: Nice.
Brennan: Hell yes. The ball's rolling up.
Ally: Yes.
: Rolling up.
Ally: Salazar.
Brennan: Cool.
: Salazar.
Siobhan: Salazar.
"Brennan: All of you walk in. All of you scooch into the hall. You see that the dogs have already made their way back to the more private quarters. There's some other people out here. You see Hyacinth Khrome over in the corner as well, and realize you probably only have 12 martrons left until things are getting started, so it's possible you got some ground to cover. Because there's also the thing that Hyacinth Khrome thinks that she's meeting you at the Obfusion Arms."
Murph: Can you send her a message?
"Siobhan: Yeah. Can I psychically? She's less than 120 feet away from me, right?"
"Brennan: Yes. Yes, she is, so you can do it."
"Siobhan: Great, so can I say,"
"Riva: Hi, change of plans? We're just going to need the credits. Sorry, hang on. Please hold."
S: Where should we say to meet her afterwards?
Ally: Our dock.
: The casino.
Zac: Is she going to go all the way there?
Ally: Have a droid send it to the casino.
Murph: At the casino.
: Have a droid-
Murph: We just won't go. No one else is in trouble until you see us.
Siobhan: Okay.
Riva: Thank you for holding. At the Emerald casino-
Lou: The Emerald Comet.
"Riva: The Emerald Comet casino. If you could have just a drone send it to care of the Emerald Comet casino, we will pick it up from there."
"Brennan: You hear her thoughts back, saying,"
": I have no idea what sort of technology is allowing you to just speak in my mind, and I don't know who you are, or what you're talking about. The Emerald Comet? Interesting."
Brennan: And you see her walk away. But she heard the Emerald Comet.
Ally: Okay.
Lou: She's playing cool.
: She's playing cool.
": God, she's good."
: She's so cool.
Brennan: Amazing. What do the four of you do here in this space?
"Siobhan: Well, I think we want to get-"
: Is the Princeps with us?
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: The Princeps is there. Yeah. The Princeps is here and the two of you are in the back area looking around. What do you all do?
": I think we should clear the way, and maybe knock a couple of these people unconscious."
"Zac: Yeah, I want to get a lay of the land a little bit, and also see if there's any other giant animals back here."
"Brennan: Yeah, if you want to split up and look for this thing, go ahead and give me Investigation check."
: 15.
: 23.
"Brennan: On a 15, I'm actually going to say that you find Aurora Nebbins. You find the room there."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: 23, you're scooting around looking for it, and you clock Aurora Nebbins as well, but are distracted. You look around and see a little area behind you, and you see that there is a groomer with a dog. The owner of the dog is not present. There's a little peach, pink pug that turns around, looks at you. And the pug leaps off, and the groomer goes and grabs its leash real quick, but it sniffs you and you see the pug starts going..."
(Brennan shrieks)
: Can I get Insight check real fast?
Brennan: Yeah. Make an Insight check. Go for it.
: That is only 12 actually.
: 12\. You don't know. This pug's going berserk.
: I scoot away from it because I don't want any attention right now.
"Brennan: Okay, you scoot away from that. Other four out with the Princeps, what are you up to?"
"Murph: We got to get into those pens, right?"
"Ally: Yeah, we start combing the back."
": I found the room that it's in, so I'm posted up, trying to look natural, but darting around, looking for them."
": Cool. You are posted up, looking around. You are backstage. It says, 10 martrons until places. Voice comes on. Time is of the essence. You're moving fast. Now, Aurora Nebbins has moved out to not as private, but a small staging area. It's not the crowd, it's not the spectators, but there's probably a couple dozen people in here, groomers, people managing dogs. And there's a bunch of different dogs that are on their things. Hyacinth is one station away, glaring at Aurora Nebbins, and Nabthacks, her rival. And you guys see, as you get away, this peachy, pug, screaming. And keeps looking right at the Skipper. You see an owner has come over, and you see the pug starts freaking out at the owner, and you see the owner says,"
"Whoa, Melon. What's up, Melon? Sweetie. Do you want to say something to daddy?"""
This big blond pompadour.
"""Say something to daddy."""
(Brennan groans)
And they start just sort of making out off in the corner. All of you-
"Emily: Can I just make eye contact with everyone, and be like,"
"""I'm just going to get in there and hop on this thing, giddy up."""
"Siobhan: Do it sneakily, because there's a bunch of crazy security stuff in this place. If they see us stealing this very valuable dog, we're going to get in trouble."
: Can I-
: I think we got to just-
": I know I said I didn't want to hurt the dog, but this isn't a dog. This thing spits acid. Let's just knock it out."
Lou: Are there still androids holding it down?
Brennan: Aurora seems to be somewhat calm. The androids are stationed to either side of Aurora.
: Are we going?
"Emily: Okay, I'm going to try and hop on it, and ride it out of here and that doesn't work, attack it."
"Lou: Great. I think at the exact moment that Sid hops on, I'd like to reboot one of the androids."
"Brennan: Amazing. So you're going to go to get in position, right? Are the rest of you all standing in a clump? Are some of you getting near the doors? You see there's doors, security and other stuff like that. Where are you all positioned at in this space?"
"Siobhan: I want to be close enough, so within 60 feet, to be able to cast Hallucination on this dog."
": 60 feet is also, I think, my distance from the dog. closer to the door."
: Amazing.
": I am just going to, on the opposite side of the room from the animal that's yelling at me."
: Can I block the door?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can get in the doorway."
Emily: I'm casting Enhance Droid on myself to get advantage on Wisdom checks. And I've got an ion grenade in my hand that I'm ready to throw.
: Can I make the skills exploit Angle Perception on the blue mastiff?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Murph: I'm just going to get in position to blast some people.
: Hell yeah.
: Did you say that-
: One last roll on the peach pug? Can I figure out what the fuck is going on?
"Brennan: Yeah, do a roll on the peach pug. Go for it."
: 12.
"Brennan: As Sid is starting to get into position, Barry, you're over by the door, and you hear a voice over your shoulder, say,"
"Voice: What's up, you fucking Jamoke? Nice disguise. You look like a fucking dick."
Barry Syx: Who the fuck are you?
"Brennan: You turn around and see just a weird-looking, very out of place here, a weird-looking armor, partially space-armored lunatic. Very wide-eyed, got crazy green mohawk. He's like,"
"Mohawk: Syx, I thought we were going afterwards, man. But, shit, we got him right here."
"Barry Syx: That's funny as fuck, dude. You know what's going to be way funnier than everything you're saying?"
Mohawk: What's that?
Barry Syx: When I break your fucking nose.
Murph: And then I just whack him.
"Brennan: You see, he goes… You guys see before the plan goes off, Barry fucking lays a dude out. And he goes,"
"Mohawk: What the fuck, man? That's not part of the plan."
": Oh, what?"
Brennan: Give me an Insight check.
Siobhan: Oh dear.
Murph: Two.
"Brennan: Two. You have no idea. He's like,"
"Mohawk: What the fuck, man?"
Murph: I keep kicking his head.
"Brennan: You hear an alarm go off. Security sounds. As you look over, the pug busts out of its chains, rushes over to you and leaps at your face, and jams its tongue into your eye. As it goes in, you suddenly feel a wash of chemicals, and you hear a voice deep inside you go,"
"Voice: Your majesty. It's you. We've found you, after all this time."
Skip: You must be mistaken. I don't know what you're talking about.
Voice: Prince Valdrinor.
: What?
Skip: I am not ready right now. You must leave right now.
Voice: Your father-
Skip: I order you to leave.
Voice: You order me to leave?
Skip: I order you to leave-
"Voice: Sire, your father, King Probis."
: What the fuck?
"Skip: Shut your mouth. If you ever speak of this again, I will wipe your line from existence."
"Brennan: We leave from that interaction. You hear alarms going off. You see that the captain has gone fully catatonic as this pug has buried its tongue under one of his eyelids. Just holding a pug. Shit has gone sideways. You see Hyacinth Khrome. In your head, you hear the pug say,"
Pug: It is time. The great imhatchening can begin.
Brennan: And the tongue is removed from your eye. The pug turns to the owner and goes… And you see the owner pulls out a gun and starts blasting into the crowd.
"Emily: I mean, I'm just going to hop on this creature."
"Lou: Reboot, at the same time."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: Hallucinate. It's the scariest fucking thing that you've ever seen.
Murph: I still think this dude is part of the plan.
"Emily: I'm going to Minor Illusion a super hot version of this blue Mastiff, right through that tunnel, hop on it, try to do an animal handling, and throw an ion grenade over my shoulder, to try and fuck up all the equipment."
Brennan: Okay. What checks are you making?
"Emily: I'm making a minor hologram, and then also throwing this ion grenade to fuck up the things. And then I guess an Animal Handling."
Brennan: Make an animal handling check. You have Enhanced Droid on that.
Ally: Can I...
Emily: Okay. 18.
Brennan: 18\. And what is the hallucination you're creating?
"Emily: It's a Wisdom saving throw, and-"
": Before you do that, can we say that I do my Skills Exploit?"
Brennan: Yes. I rolled. It failed on its check. It got natural two.
: Okay.
Brennan: It fails its saving throw.
": The most cute and fluffy thing you've ever seen, which in my mind is the scariest thing to this scary thing."
Brennan: Yes.
"Siobhan: Just poofs into existence behind it, and tries to hug it."
Ally: I use my blaster to blast its chains or ropes or whatever.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. A bunch of blasters get drawn. You hit the chains. Androids fall back, you jump on this thing. Hyaa. Aurora Nebbins rears up, looks over at Myalor Nabthacks. As the chains snap, Myalor says,"
Myalor: Oh no.
Brennan: This thing goes and bites Myalor Nabthacks's head off.
Emily: I could get a bonus for that.
"Brennan: You see Hyacinth goes,"
Hyacinth: Holy shit.
"Brennan: You see that this dude underneath you says,"
"Mohawk: What the fuck, dude?"
"Brennan: Takes out blaster, says,"
Mohawk: We're supposed to do the job.
Brennan: Points at the Princeps and fires at the Princeps.
Ally: No.
": Bonus action, guard."
"Brennan: Bonus guard. That is a nat one on the disadvantage roll. You boom, body out of the way. Princeps dives for cover, grabs onto Aurora Nebbins, snakes through the crowd, you hear-"
Emily: I want to fall back on the tail. What is that called?
Lou: Like on a bus?
Emily: Yeah. Drifting or whatever.
"Brennan: You hear,"
Announcer: Welcome one and all to the 78th Cyclical Carbine Kennel Club dog show.
"Brennan: You see Jimmy the ferret. Rootersnoos ferret, Jimmy the Snout. His dais is destroyed as Aurora Nebbins surges through it into the midst of hundreds of onlookers, screaming. but it goes out through the main dog show, and a bunch of Rootersnoos cameras all on you."
"Emily: When they catch me, I say,"
Sidney: I've been Warfare Whitney. You can't trust me.
Ally: Oh my God.
"Brennan: The Princeps Zortch, they are holding onto one of your roller skates, as Aurora Nebbins crashes out of there."
Zac: Am I still conscious?
"Brennan: Yeah, you're good to go. Once the pug removed its tongue from your eyeball, that communication was closed, and the pug barked some kind of order. You immediately thought that the pug is a superior to whatever, that the pug's owner is probably also another cerebro slug."
"Zac: I see. I will look at them with a deathly stare, and then just keep running after my friends."
Brennan: You see the pug looks after you and just goes...
(pug barks)
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Okay. You see the captain is shooting this pug. Incredible. You dip out of there. Gunnie, Margaret, Barry, Riva. What's going on?"
Murph: I also leave.
"Lou: Yeah, I'm going to run with Barry after Aurora Nebbins."
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: I throw myself at Barry. I say,"
Gunnie: Carry me.
"Lou: I go, dip out of this business, back to the ship. Can I get the ship ready to leave?"
"Brennan: You start booting up the systems right now. As you do, you hear some chaos and see messages coming up on your personal comms, from Pleasure Putty headquarters at Bargain Bliss, saying,"
"Pleasure Putty Headquarters: Mx. Riva, Please tell us how and why you acquired these most recent subs. We are finding their desire for the program difficult to manage."
"Riva: I got them because one of them was getting married, and I'm very good at my job of being a boss."
"Brennan: You're getting the ship up and you're getting these emails from Pleasure Putty headquarters. Something wild happened here. As you get the drone and run away, Margaret and Gunnie, you have the least heat on you, so you just dip the hell out of there."
"Ally: Yes, yes."
"Brennan: And start to run. Barry, as you start to run, the blood covered guy behind you goes,"
"Mohawk: What the fuck, Barry? Your disguise is fucking stupid. Your fucking number's backwards."
Barry Syx: [long pause] Where's Barry?
Mohawk: Oh shit.
Brennan: This guy fucking jet packs out the window.
Mohawk: Barry!!!
Zac: Am I anywhere near this?
Brennan: You are. You're still-
Zac: Can I just jump on the jet pack?
"Brennan: Absolutely. You jump on. Guy smashes out a window. You see there's another guy nearby who says,"
: It's all happening.
Brennan: And just unloads as well. It looks like a lot of shit went sideways.
: Can we dip out the back way? So I'm not on any news channel.
Emily: I want my face to be the face of this.
": Yeah, yeah, perfect."
"Brennan: You are fully clocked by Rootersnoos, leaving here-"
"Emily: I'm winking at every individual camera, flexing."
"Brennan: Amazing. Gunnie, Riva, Barry, you make it out of here. Skip, you jump on this guy's jet pack."
Zac: Grabbing his ankles.
"Brennan: You grab his ankles. He takes you out to the street. He goes,"
": What the fuck, man? Stop. This wasn't even supposed to happen now. What's your deal?"
Skip: Give me that.
Brennan: He lands on the roof and gives you his jet pack.
(all laughing)
": What the fuck, man? Tell someone I'm up here. Tell someone I'm up here."
Zac: I circle back and just roundhouse him in the face.
"Brennan: You zoom away in your jet pack. Sid, you ride this fucking hellish dog. Go ahead and give me one more Animal Check with Persuasion."
Emily: Really bad.
Brennan: I'm sorry. Animal Handling. Yeah. Yeah.
"Emily: Yeah, that's going to be a 10."
"Brennan: A 10. This thing is delighted to be free. It is hard to control this monster. Just zooming through Blue Heaven, screaming. You all get to the downsy-daisy."
Zac: I'm going to go to the casino.
Brennan: Okay. Yes. You have your jet pack.
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: And you also have that bonus action Dash. You get there. Go ahead, get there. You see, waiting out front is the android Salazar."
Zac: Give me that.
"Brennan: As you depart, I'm going to roll a Luck check in front of the board."
"Ally: Okay. Yeah, definitely."
Brennan: You want high.
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: Here. That's a three.
Ally: Fuck.
"Brennan: You see Salazar standing there and saying,"
Salazar: Absolutely. I would be more than happy. I just need confirmation from Ms. Khrome that everything's gone according to plan.
Skip: Give me that.
Zac: I pull my pistol.
Brennan: Incredible. You pull a gun. Go ahead and give me Intimidation check.
Zac: 12.
"Brennan: 12\. Okay. Salazar says,"
Salazar: I don't wish for violence. I simply wish for confirmation. I don't see Aurora Nebbins yet. I'm supposed to get confirmation from Ms. Khrome.
Zac: Can I make a Perception check to see if I hear or see any sign of Aurora Nebbins?
Murph: Or the TVs.
"Zac: Or the TVs? Yeah, if there's any live footage playing."
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and give me a Perception check."
Zac: That is a 22.
"Brennan: You point to a screen streaming Rec Station news and see a helipod chase looking at Sid and the Princeps, weaving through beautiful boulevards on Blue Heaven, in a cop's high-speed chase of this monster dog weasel."
"Salazar: All right, that'll do it. Here you go."
"Brennan: A 25,000 credit card lands in front of you. You blast away. All of you converge. You see everybody converging here. You get to the Pleasure Putty factory first. You beat everyone here. The rest of you are coming down. You get Aurora Nebbins to the downsy daisy."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: You begin to shoot down just this levitating monster thing.
"Emily: Everyone, I think I'm taking a liking to her. Bring her aboard the ship?"
: No.
Siobhan: Absolutely not.
"Brennan: You've got things up and booted. You see, poking his head in, is Raymond Zam."
"Raymond: Hey, we're still waiting on a couple of Jib-Jobbers."
": Hi, Raymond."
"Raymond: Hi. Hey, waiting on a couple Jib-Jobbers to get here. Just want to know, because I see the engines are booting up."
: What's their ETA?
Raymond: Should be here in the next five to 10.
": Okay, five, yes. 10, no."
Raymond: Okay. Are we expecting a hot exit?
: Medium heat. I think a medium rare.
"Brennan: You see, he goes and opens a little Jib-Job cabinet, and takes a laser rifle out, and just goes,"
"Raymond: All right. I'll be posted up, just to provide cover for the Jib- Jobbers."
: I love a man that's good at his job.
"Brennan: As you're flying back, you hear loud, raucous noises from the factory outlet Pleasure Putty training center. You hear,"
": My own boss, my own boss. My own boss. My own..."
: Maybe more like two.
"Brennan: All of you rushing in, you converge. Barry, you're there with the drone in your arms. Margaret, Gunnie, Skip you're hovering, or waiting for them to round the corner, and the Princeps and Sid on Aurora Nebbins, all converge as, boom, an enormous explosion, like the kind you saw at the Brigader's Bier Hot Pleasure Putty raining down on all of you. As it touches your skin, it feels so good."
: Oh my God.
(all groaning)
: I've heard this about horseback riding.
"Brennan: Skip, at that moment that you've got the credit card, you got a 22 Perception, right?"
Zac: Yes.
"Brennan: On the ticker underneath, the Rootersnoos ticker, you also read, ""Wanted: Norman ""Skip"" Takamori, for the murder of 12 sisters of the Cosmic Vale in the Hecatoncheires Asteroid Cluster."""
"Skip: [furtively] My name is Norman ""Skip"" Takamori."
"Brennan: You all converge. As you converge, you see putty mongers fleeing from the exploding putty factory, and converging behind you are a group of Rec Pols on scooters saying,"
Rec Pols: Stop. Return that royal blue mastiff at once.
"Brennan: And you see, also coming from the other way, a squadron of Americadian space brigadiers going,"
Americadians: Norman Takamori. You're under arrest.
Brennan: I'm going to need everyone here to roll Initiative.
(all groaning)
Brennan: That's all for this episode of Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey. Tune in next week as we rush to get back on The Wurst. See you in the stars.

Zortch: I'll always remember you.
Skip: Carry me.

Skip: Pick me up. Put me on the ship.
Brennan: 16 is the DC.

": Wait, that's actually rocking."

(upbeat music)
"Br: Hello one and all, welcome back to another thrilling episode of Dimension I am your humble dungeon master Brennan Lee Mulligan with me as always are our Intrepid heroes say hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"All: Hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"Brennan: Last we left off our gang, our crew, yes, indeed the crew of the Wurst, newly named, had just abducted the Royal Blue Mastiff, Aurora Nebbins, fulfilling a Smash 'n Grab contract from Hyacinth Khrome, more than fulfilling I'll say, and as things are wont to do in wild locations, like Rec 97, things went a little bit sideways, confrontations with people that seemed to know the long lost Barry Nine, a strange pug named Melon sticking its tongue into the eye of the Skipper-"
: See ya!
"Br: Abducting the Mastiff, coming into contact with a supercomputer entity known as Gnosis, getting the repairs done on the ship, getting yourself alerted to the fuzz of various factions all across the galaxy and losing 500 credits and a number of important weapons at the Emerald Comet Casino-"
: Doesn't seem like that big a deal anymore.
"Brennan: An enormous explosion at the Bargain Bliss Pleasure Putty Factory Outlet and Training Center brings us to the world of Talespire, and I'll be frank one of the coolest maps we ever had on this show."
: It's so fucking cool.
"Brennan: If not the coolest, look at this. You see the no longer ""used"" refueled, repaired, and ready-to-go the Wurst in front of you at the end of dock number 69420 here on level seven, the Vale of Tiers, you have a ready to rip outta here starship, you have a super computer and an alien Princeps who apparently knows how to cook and you have a data card with 25.000 credits on it."
: Is there a way to scan that with one of our devices and make sure it's legit?
"Br: If you want to take time in the initiative order, hey, listen I'm not even saying it's a bad idea. I'm saying it's maybe actually a good idea."
: I don't know if we want to know the answer to that. I think we kind of can't.
": Let's believe, let's believe."
": Yeah, let's believe."
"Br: Let's believe. However, here's what's going wrong due to the expansive mood of one soon-to-be-married Zvoon having exploded inside of the Factory Outlet and Training Center, hot Pleasure Putty is raining from what on a planet would be the sky and the here is just sort of the upper atmosphere of this artificial layer. You are being pursued from one direction by Rec Pols coming after you due to the chaos caused on the Blue Heaven level up above and from the other direction by a squadron of Amercadian Space Brigaders here to arrest Norman Takamori for the murder of 12 sisters of the Cosmic Veil. How strange."
"E: Let's brain slug into Aurora, we can have it all."
"Brennan: That's right, now with all of the world bearing down we can see the wanted signs coming up on the Rec Station's holo-screens. We see our heroes, Gunnie Miggles-Rashbax, the unconscious inert psychodrone of Riva who warged back onto the ship, the newly jet-packed Skipper, by the way go ahead and take your jet pack if you'd be so kind."
: Yes baby.
: Laminated.
: Shiny Pokemon card.
": Yeah, collectible."
"Br: Fly speed of 40, runs off of power cells which are the same things that power your like assault rifles and things like that. We have Margaret Encino. We have Sundry Sidney astride Aurora Nebbins, the Royal Blue Mastiff with the Princeps Zortch hanging to the side."
": Now that I've seen her, she's coming on the ship."
"Br: What a beautiful dog and we of course, over there with the floating psychodrone is Big Barry Syx. All of you see at the end of the dock, your vessel, if you could only get aboard. Fleeing putty mongers run away from the sounds of explosions in the factory outlet and with the, past the docking gate, not visible here on the map, but you see in his lovely sweater vest with a little sort of like to-go mug of tea next to him, and a ion beam rifle in his hands is Raymond Zam. Raymond Zam, the man preparing to cover for any Jib- Jobbers approaching the ship for what he called a hot exit. With that said we are gonna dive right into combat first in the initiative order, Gunnie Miggles-Rashbax."
L: Rough- I shouldn't be here. I think Gunnie will take 30 feet of movement going from here to behind these rocks and is gonna ready an action to cast or to use Flash on the area between that the Rec Pol people will have to come through as they chase after us I'm assuming.
"Brennan: Great, you see the screen there wanted, wanted Norman Takamori, you hide behind this little advertisement covered taxi dispatch here at the end of the dock and you are gonna ready the Flash spell."
"L: Exactly, okay, I'd like to cast it like right about here when they, when the Rec Pol people come through that way."
"Br: Okay, when the Rec Pol people come through that way, you are gonna hit them with a Flash spell. I will let you insert yourself in the initiative order. You have your reaction prepared for that spell to go off."
: 90 feet. So we should be good.
": Okay, so mounted over here on these various Rec Pol scooters, it is now gonna be the Rec Pols' turn. One of the lieutenants shouts after all of you fleeing,"
"""Stop! You're under arrest!"""
Br: Does that Rec Pol lieutenant see any sign of a cessation of movement?
E: A middle finger comes out of my gun.
"Br: Incredible, you hear one of the lieutenants say,"
Open fire!
"Br: And the Rec Pols are going to unload. So first things first, the Rec Pol officers are going to fire. I'm gonna say that these three are gonna take attacks on Sundry Sidney for that middle finger going up in the-"
E: Can I cast Shield 'cause I haven't gone yet?
Br: You can cast Shield.
"E: Okay then I'm, I'm just gonna go ahead and they're all gonna hit me or they're all gonna fire at me and I have a bad AC. So Shield- AC's 20 now. I like use all the little bristles on Aurora's back and make like a cage."
(Brennan snorting)
": Amazing, the shield goes up."
: She's so cute.
": Yeah, I agree, thank you."
"Br: Okay, the nearby sergeants for the Rec Pol are gonna add their leadership die to all these attacks. That's gonna be a plus two, to all of the attacks from the Rec Pol. So, so the Rec Pols are giving the commands rather than firing this turn, and Sid's new AC, you said it's gonna be a dirty 20 or 20."
": Dirty 20, it'll be dirty."
"Br: You all watch Sid turn around, you've never seen someone wearing roller skates riding on a beast of any kind before you whip around and your cybernetic arm raises up (laser firing) and lasers ping harmlessly"
"off of your shield. You are unhit by the Rec Pol, Big Barry that is, also all of those Rec Pol are going take movements on their Rec Pol scooters. So those scooters are gonna move a full 50 feet forward."
: So it's nine Paul Blarts.
: Nine Paul Blarts.
": Guys, we gotta steal at least one of these scooters."
": Okay guys, there's only so much space on the ship."
: We need to make space for Aurora.
": We always have room for scooters, Gunnie."
: These scooters are rad.
"Br: These scooters are gonna pull forward hovering sort of directly behind slash on top of Aurora Nebbins to get clear lines of fire, and this last one right here is gonna take a position with partial cover behind the central column of the up and downsie-daisy right here."
L: And I'll hit those ones on a scooter with a flash as they take their position.
Br: Incredible what's the area of effect on that Flash?
L: What's the area of effect? It's 20 feet.
"Br: Incredible, you can probably hit both scooters if you want, because you can set the point higher up to not hit any of your pals."
: Let's do it.
"Br: Okay and oh, this is gonna put folks to sleep, right?"
"L: No, I blind people."
"Br: Oh, you blind people. Gotcha."
L: That's my thing.
: Incredible. Okay.
L: Do you have one d10 for me?
"S: Of course I do, absolutely, I do."
"L: Oh, thank you."
"S: Oh, you're so welcome."
"L: 10, 21, 30 points of-"
E: HP? I think it's HP?
"L: Yeah of HP starting with the creature that has the lowest hit points each other is affected. You know, you know this goes."
: It blinds them?
L: It blinds them.
"Br: Okay so all you see as the Rec Pol say, stop you're under arrest and the lieutenants yell, open fire they're making from their ship. Gunnie rushes forward, whips around. I'm gonna say your torso full spins around, so your legs are facing the opposite direction from your torso."
: Yes.
"Br: And you a flash of a little like tech dart fires out, the Rec scooter with the two regular Rec Pol on it? Both of them are completely blinded. They're also going full speed on a Rec scooter so we're actually gonna just turn that into a dex save right now."
: Great.
"Br: Because you've elected to do something which actually deeply increases the efficacy of your tech power, blinding an enemy is a good idea, blinding them while they're riding a full speed Rec Pol scooter even better. We are gonna roll another savings throw against your tech power. This is gonna be a dexterity saving throw for them. They're gonna do it with disadvantage because they are blinded. However, I will say, if they fail by, you want them to fail, but you don't want them to fail by more than 10."
: Why is that?
Brennan: You're about to find out.
: Is he gonna crash like into you?
: Or they're gonna mess up the scooter.
": Oh, even worse."
: We don't need the scooter.
: We can have Aurora though right?
: Of course we need Aurora that escape pod needs a new tenant.
": Lower of these two, If they roll a, it's really that if they roll a one or a two that it's quite bad."
: Okay.
: That's two nat ones.
": Oh my god, what?"
: No way.
"L: Gunnie puts down his datapad, walks back to the casino."
: What the hell?
": One in 400 odds, I'm gonna need, I'm gonna need a dex saving throw."
": No you're not, no you're not."
: I'm gonna need a dex saving throw.
: No I'm not gonna do it dude.
: If you could.
: I'm not.
": What if the other one's doing okay though and helps 'cause that was still a disadvantage. So one of them really fucked up, what about the other one?"
": Try to crit, try to crit and then when it-"
"Brennan: If you hit a nat 20, if you hit a nat 20 right now, if you hit a nat 20 right now, I think, I think this is the, I think we're gonna have to rearrange the order of the universe within this setting if you hit a nat 20 here."
Zac: Try to hit a nat 20.
: Just try to hit it.
: Try and hit a nat 20.
: Which dice rolled that nat one? This is the one we lost 500 on.
: You got it.
: Change.
: Guaranteed.
: My future is changing.
Murph: That's a six.
: That's the same thing it rolled yesterday when I lost all my money.
: My future is changing.
: Why do you still have that dice that were rolling so poorly for Fabian.
: [Emily] I think I know why-
": [Ally] This is the perfect time to say, Lou. (Lou wheezing) This is some, this is Fabian going off on his own energy,"
: Are you hacking a dice?
: What the fuck is wrong with everything there?
: That was the best thing that's happened so far.
": Lou, Lou, Lou, can I offer you something? These glow in the dark, they're incredible."
: Yeah I'd love them.
: And I would love for you to use these today.
: I have a feeling these are being thrown.
: No!
": Cool, so what happens, bro?"
: Unbelievable.
: I'm not doing it dude.
: That is a 10.
: That is a 10.
: I got a 10.
": Okay we got a 10. Okay, so."
: Two nat ones.
": So these guys round the corner, boom, and then you go bam flash bang. Oh no, no, no, no, no, and you see that the Rec Pol scooter smashes into the taxi kiosk explodes dealing nine points of incendiary damage to you."
": Oh my god, so you're at two HP right now because you only have 11 HP?"
": I'm a first level engineer, I'm not built for combat. Yeah, I have two HP."
": I will say this, both of those Rec Pols are fully dead."
: But I'm on fire.
: You're on fire.
: And that's like 600.000 credits.
"Brennan: Scooter is toast, scooter is, scooter is fully no more, blew up hit the taxi kiosk and is destroyed."
: Gunnie immediately knows everyone's gonna be so mad at him 'cause of the scooter.
: Sidney's fricking psyched 'cause this means more room for Aurora on the ship.
": Oh, you do see that some of the kiosk like incendiary hits the Pleasure Putty factory, and you can tell that something important catches on fire in the Pleasure Putty factory."
: Oh my god.
": Quite bad but an incredibly flashy intro to this combat, Barry that's gonna be your turn."
: Right on.
": I can't, two nat ones, we said only a one or two is it gonna be bad on. Two nat ones, one in 400 odds."
: That was insane.
": All right, Barry's 100% gonna get this other scooter. I am going to go into the zone, bonus action, put on bigger sunglasses, and then I'm going to, what would be the mechanics of it? So I want to kind of just jump on there and do a shove attack, and I know I can't get both of them off, but just keep one of them on, literally just like commandeer it just like grab the one dude and throw them off, and just go."
Brennan: Only one of them.
: [Ally] One of them is still holding on.
"Brennan: Yeah, only one of them is piloting it."
": Yeah, I jump on there and I just grab them by the head and try to like shove them off."
": Okay, do you have the ability to leap to that, to leap all the way up, do a 10 foot vertical leap up to the Rec Police?"
": [Emily] Probably, that's strength."
": I mean, I'd like to think I do."
: Can you kick off the mastiff?
": Yeah, can I?"
: You can cross through where you're like hopping on that box?
": Okay, bonus action you go into the zone."
: Right.
: Am I wrong in thinking?
": I do have a bonus action jump thing, but it's about a bonus action and I'm in the zone."
": Oh, you can reach up and grab something 17.5 feet off the ground."
": Sweet, so I just do a box jump, I run over and I'll be like, I'll be taking that, and I squat and then I jump up and then I try to smash the one person off."
": Cool you use your full movement. You take like a running start, leap up. So now your action is going to be, and actually yeah, your action's gonna be a shove attack against this person, this is contested."
: Hell yeah.
: Sweet.
": They, so this person is, they're a lieutenant, so they're a little bit tougher than the Rec Pols that just got incinerated due to Gunnie's flash grenade. The number you are trying to beat here is going to be 13."
": Okay I have good athletics. I have advantage, I theoretically I should do this but we shall see."
: But only if you've got...
": Okay, 22."
(Ally laughs)
": All right, all of you turn to see, so Gunnie leaps behind the kiosk. You turn around search for- this thing is not like hovering off the ground, it's 10 feet up. Bam, you flip your body up and kick this Rec Pol Lieutenant off the speeder, off the scooter and sit into the seat, but that is your action,"
"bonus action, and movement to get up there."
: Right on.
": But I will say this to our Talespire crew the Lieutenant that gets that gets kicked off takes four points of falling damage, hitting the floor underneath. Incredible, we move forward in initiative. Those putty mongers are just going to continue to flee. So those putty mongers flee in all directions."
: I am not gonna interrupt them.
": Screaming, ah run for your lives. We're not up to code."
: Oh god.
": Take em down, Sid."
: What does that mean?
: We gotta get out of here.
: That's not okay.
: This is gonna be a massacre.
"Brennan: That's gonna be Skip and Sid, you act on the same initiative so go in whichever order you guys want. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do."
": I was gonna go throw two grenades at the gaggle over there. One was gonna hopefully light the, light on fire the putty to make a little firewall and then the other was hopefully gonna stun them."
": The, that Amercadian?"
: Yeah so if you want it to get in there after.
": I think, I think I'm running out, I think this place is gonna blow up."
: Okay.
": I think like that's a good, that sounds good to me though. I might like try to scoop somebody."
": I basically was, didn't want you to get in the melee there."
: Oh yeah.
": Yeah, yeah, okay. So why don't you go and then I'll go after."
": Yeah, maybe Skip sees like threats around and looks to Marg just like what?"
": Um, maybe the Princeps?"
: And Skip's gonna nod and just press the buttons on his jet pack.
": The Skipper was flying in waiting for these guys. So I think you don't even need to use a bonus action. You've been, you've been levitated, like you, you went and got that the data card from Salazar the Android. You're good to go so you can be flying. What are you gonna do?"
": I'm gonna grab the Princeps and just dash forward reaction disengage. I don't know if I'm gonna see anything, that's gonna swipe at me, but just in-"
": You use your object interaction to grab the Princep Zortch off of Aurora Nebbins, and let's go ahead and measure your movement, how far you're gonna get."
: 'Cause I have-
: 40 fly.
: 40 fly plus my bonus action cunning...?
: Cunning action? So you can move 120 this turn if you want to.
": [Ally] Yes Skip, get the fuck out of here."
: I am gonna go all the way to this like what is the purple-ish blue one?
": Okay, so you're gonna pop right there. You're gonna go a hundred-"
: I'm a little nervous about like this area maybe can I make like a perception check once I get there to see if I can like-
": That's a shrewd thing to ask for Zac, go ahead and give me a perception check."
: Okay.
: Being shrewd.
: Fuck.
": Yes, okay, cool, cool."
: That's an eight.
": All I'm gonna tell you on an eight is this, you know that you at the speed you're going, you will not have time to react if there are things around these buildings, the two buildings that we're talking about here are there's a money exchange place, but this is a lot of like airport stuff, right? So there's a, there's a taxi kiosk, there's this money exchange here. However, it's also a Rec Station so this is a free booters club, which is effectively, so ""boot"" is slang for ""fuck"" in this galaxy, so this is basically a swingers club that-"
": Oh no, Pleasure Putty hitting a-"
: [Brennan and Emily] Swingers club.
: There's another explosion coming.
: [Lou] There's an ocean of ejaculate is coming.
": Barry, they're gonna rival you in the bathroom."
(all laughing)
: You don't have to bring up that story anymore.
": Yes, so in other words, on an eight, I can't tell you what your perceive here, you know that you will have to, like, if you fly, you'll see it if you fly past, but you won't have the ability to like see it and react in time to stop."
": So can I go to this, like if you're looking at the free booters club sign, like this, like this like rounded corner on the second floor, can I like fly up there with the Princeps?"
: Oh fuck yeah baby. Hell yeah.
: Use that jet pack.
: Three dimensions.
"Brennan: Okay, so yeah, so you and the Princeps pop up to that corner. So you jet pack and very like operative style get behind a corner of the building to get cover and it is very good that you do 'cause some attacks are coming your way right now."
: Oh shit.
: Yikes.
: Oh from what?
: Oh shit.
": I'm gonna go ahead and roll luck checks. I want to see I'm not, I'm not gonna dick you over. I'm gonna see how prepared these factions are, so faction to the right let's see how prepared they are. Four, not prepared at all. Faction to the left, However, oh, this is so fascinating. Let's reveal who we're dealing with here."
: Why did I forget to be worried?
": Right I was like, when I killed two people I was like, wow we're good."
": ""Why did I forget to be worried?"" is so funny."
": Hyper prepared is a group of UFTP agents that had been running to the dock here and the other side don't seem bothered by you at all, Skip, are a group of bounty hunters with Repo Reaper name tags on them."
: [Siobhan] God damn.
: Oh my God. They look incredible.
: They're so sick looking.
: One of them is in like designer slides and then this other person looks like he's wearing Uggs.
": So yeah, the Repo Reapers just appear to be sort of walking calmly forward in this direction. You see that the UFTP agents, now that is really interesting here."
: A weird amount of cover?
": You, that's the thing. I think you've done exactly the right thing to get almost total cover from these guys."
: Yeah.
: Please don't shoot.
: Let me see.
: Wait.
: Wait.
: Fill 'er up.
": Norm you hug, you fly in, look down just long enough and you see they say, there he is, and take out their light pistols and you and Zortch hug to the wall and see the edge of the rounded roof. You have total cover from attacks. A perfect tactical move."
": Yes, dude!"
"Brennan: No, no damage, baby. Okay, so Skip that's you, Sid it's still also your, that was them using all of their reactions to do that. It's not their turn and you see that the Repo Reapers don't appear to be coming for you."
: Okay. I don't think I even know what those guys are.
: I don't think anybody does.
Murph: What have you done?
": Oh shit, I'm so sorry. You took, you took damage, right?"
: Yes.
"Brennan: Go ahead and make a constitution saving throw, if you'd be so kind."
": Uh, that's a 10."
": You took nine points of damage, right?"
: Yes.
: Go ahead and roll nine d4 times 10.
: No!
"Brennan: You can do that on your own time. You let me know after you're done rolling. That's yeah, nine d4 times 10. You do that let me know what you got in a second. Sid, what are you up to?"
: Okay.
: And you're all Aurora Nebbins acts on your turn as well.
": What is Aurora's movement? I've been riding her, so I'm probably getting a good feel for it."
": Yeah, actually gives me an animal handling check."
: Okay I still have enhanced Android.
": Yes, yes, yes."
: You've got this.
": Come on, crit, baby, please. All right, 14."
": You sense, first of all, Aurora Nebbins is fully hairless. You think that this dog may be partially aquatic. You also, it has a speed of 50, so Aurora Nebbins can haul ass if need be. You also think that you've seen the fastest you've seen Aurora move is when she is rushing to strike somebody. You think that she has like an adrenal gland that picks up speed if she is going to lunge at someone."
": My explosive fighting style, I can throw a grenade as bonus action."
Brennan: Correct.
": But then I could also throw on as an action, right?"
": Yeah, absolutely."
": Great, so what I want to do is I want to just like take Aurora like 10 feet forward to get within range 'cause I have a 55 range to throw the grenades."
": Amazing, you've used your corsair ability to boost your range on that, awesome."
": Yeah, so I wanna get within range to the people that are closer and with putty in front of them, I want to throw an incendiary grenade at them, and hopefully I think I can, I think I can frame in some of the putty to make a little wall of fire, and then I wanna throw a stun grenade at the people behind them, and I looked at it, they're all clustered within 10 feet."
": Okay, so the first cluster's getting an incendiary and the second cluster's getting a stun, amazing. Give me the save."
: Wow.
": It's a DC 14 save, dex save for each, but they have different effects, and tell me if anyone hits a one because they take max damage with my explosive fighting style."
": Alright we're gonna roll for, you see the Amercadians bearing down, you see that one of the Lieutenants says, Takamori took to the air, the android's with him riding some kind of beautiful dog."
: You got that right about beautiful.
: We all agree the dog is beautiful.
: I give her a good like dog slap.
(Aurora shrieks)
": That's her response to everything, but it didn't seem bad, so we're gonna roll the saves for the soldiers in the front and then for the lieutenants separately 'cause they have different saves. So they need to hit a 14 here. That is three fails for the soldiers in the front, we're gonna go for their-"
": So they all take 11 damage, fire damage. The other ones take half of that, and then presumably that Pleasure Putty that I was, I was probably able to get a little bit in lights on fire."
": Those brigaders all take incendiary, so the three brigaders also gonna roll for the sergeants with them. Okay, the sergeants, both sergeants make their save and take half damage in the front. You see the, as that incendiary goes off, the Pleasure Putty line that runs in front of them creates a wall of fire. Now, anyone on the other side of that wall has total concealment from firing on you guys."
: Oh you know what?
: A wall of fire opens up in front of them and they can't fire.
": Then I'm not even gonna use my stun grenade. I still have an action 'cause I just used my bonus action grenade. I'm gonna turn to this repo person who has cover, does that mean I can't hit them at all?"
": You did hear, yeah you heard fire down at that next intersection. So, you know, you don't know that there are repo men. You know that Norm, you know, that Skip has encountered enemies there. You don't know anything about them, but you know that Skip has encountered enemies down there, people opened fire on him."
": I imagine Skip would have been like, more!"
: [Emily] And then is Aurora gonna be able to get through this gaggle of Pleasure Putty people?
: Yeah.
: Okay.
: For sure she will really be able to get through.
: Oh no.
": What about, could she leap this little chasm?"
: On a successful animal handling for sure.
: I only have a plus one to animal handling.
: But you have advantage.
: We'll call it a DC 15.
": I really haven't hit that. I can't lose Aurora and I can lose the Pleasure Putty girls. Okay, I'ma…"
(all laughing)
Murph: Probably just gonna run them over.
: I'm going to- let me just measure the distance.
: Or what if you did an animal handling check to jump over them.
": Yeah, let's do that."
: That way...
: Let's do that.
: Smart.
": So I think I want to basically, while I'm riding, try to grab Gunnie to get him out of harm's way, and then I want to try to leap over these Pleasure Putty girls and then get within range to shoot one of these new foes."
: What we're gonna do is this- Aurora Nebbins is gonna use movement and action to move a hundred feet.
: Yeah.
": And Aurora's trying to stay to the flat of the dock. I mean the explosion from the putty factory has created a lot of difficult terrain, but you're trying to zig and zag to stay on terrafirma, so to speak, give me the animal handling check to see if you can leap the Pleasure Putty people."
": I believe in you, it's a 12."
": Okay you (snapping reigns) and you kick your skates into Aurora and go, hiya! and Aurora hunkers down and blasts through the Pleasure Putty people dealing-"
: Oh no.
": And now here's the thing normally it would just knock everybody prone, but because Aurora Nebbins' covered head to toe in spikes, all those Pleasure Putty people take five points of damage, not enough to kill them-"
"(all cheering) but all those pleasure, they go, please you've gotta help! And this weasel-"
: I ignore them and grab Gunnie.
": Okay, and you're gonna, are you gonna lean down and grab Gunnie with your, okay. So that's actually your, so you've used a bonus action and you have your object interaction to pick Gunnie up, you throw-"
: I'm more than an object.
": Speaking of Gunnie, what did you roll?"
: I rolled 20.
": Okay 200 credits of damage have been done to your cyborg body, and you are thrown on the back of Aurora Nebbins. Aurora moves a hundred feet down the track at a hundred feet, does Aurora see an enemy? That's the question, Talespire, let's go ahead and move Aurora, Gunnie, and Sid down the track. These poor Pleasure Putty people."
: Maybe it'll knock some sense into them.
": Actually I am gonna make a quick dex save, 'cause one of those Pleasure Putty people is literally adjacent to the opening."
: Oh no.
: That's a nat 5.
: Oh no.
: One putty person went ah! And is off into space.
": I absolutely lie, and I'm like, I actually think she was a pretty high ranking one, so probably kind of more of a villain in the MLM scheme."
": And yes, from here Aurora can definitely see enemies. Aurora has line of sight on the Repo Reapers and on UFTP agents. Aurora has the aggressive feature, which means that she can take a bonus action dash towards a hostile creature."
": Let's do it, oh actually we don't even need to. I think I'm just going to, since I got Gunnie with me, even though the Repo people weren't as aggressive, I think I'm going to, I think I'm gonna go after them because I got Gunnie with me, also Gunnie I nod to the three pistols I've disarmed people with in case you want it."
": I'm gonna, I'm gonna hold on for a second!"
": Okay, I mean, I just, I have a lot of weapons."
": Okay, thank you, thank you."
": And then I think I'm going to, what does burst mean?"
: Burst means that weapon can create a 10 foot cube where people have to dex save or take damage.
": Fuck it, I'm gonna throw my stun grenade at them."
: At the UFTP agents?
": Yeah, yeah. Let's do that."
: Hell yes.
": There's a lot. There's more of them, so yeah. So what's the language on it, is it a 10 foot radius or 10 foot area?"
: Each creature within 10 feet.
": 10 foot radius, you can absolutely hit all five of those UFTP. Go ahead and read the language on that because I think they might possibly be stunned."
: I think they're actually unconscious.
": If they fail they're unconscious. If they succeed, I think they might still be stunned. Can you read the language on that?"
": On a failed save a creature is stunned until the end of their next serve: turn, additionally, on a failed save a creature is unconscious for one minute until it takes damage or until someone uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake at the end of an affected creature's turn, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success."
: Gotcha and what's the save on that like what type of save?
: 14 constitution.
": Hell yes, okay, 14 constitution that, you've picked a good save for these UFTP agents that are really quick and smart, but not necessarily the toughest."
": I look up also to you, and like, if any of them are unconscious, you auto crit on them."
": Ah, here we go, five saves coming down the track. Oh my God."
: Oh yes.
: Four of the UFTP agents go down. Four of them are unconscious.
(grenades exploding)
"Yeah you see Sid tearing another thing just, Honestly, your gun arm is just straight up and you see these grenades come out like mortars. It makes a (mortar firing) noise as they pop out."
: Like a t-shirt cannon but with grenades!
"Brennan: Blam incendiary, blam stun, four of the UFTP agents are fully unconscious, but someone can take an action to wake them, correct?"
": I think, but I think he would need to take an action to wake one."
": Yes, wake one of them that makes sense. Okay, is Aurora taking a move action towards a hostile adversary?"
": I think she's gonna sit tight for now, 'cause we got, we got Gunnie with us."
": Incredible, amazing turns here. The prince-"
: And can I also use my body to give Gunnie cover?
": I'm trying to think you've taken an object interaction, a bonus action."
: It's totally fine if I can't.
: I don't think you can.
": I'll make it, I can make it work one more turn, one more turn yeah, one more turn. I'm not gonna go down this turn, that'd be crazy."
": And you just fall to the, the reapers like a pinata and they're just like."
"Brennan: Okay, that's gonna be the Princeps Zortch, Zortch what are we doing here?"
": What else can you do besides cook, Zortch?"
: Snazzy outfit.
: Love it.
: I like Zortch's hat.
": Skip, Princeps Zortch looks over at you and they say, can I try something real quick?"
: Yes.
: We are one.
: Oh no.
: Not again.
": And they touch their- like they swivel their cap backwards touch their forehead to yours, and you feel a sense of meditation as the Princeps brings you into a kind of psychic awareness of space and time and you see, you have probably a half second of pre-cognition, all possible futures"
"within the next half second are available to you. So any of the like all possibilities are infinite, but it's such a short window of time based on your temporal senses that you're like here is everything that can happen in the next half second, which is going to as long as you're within five feet of the Princeps, you are gonna get to add a d4 to all attack rolls, all savings throws."
: Sick.
: It looks like you guys are making out.
: [Emily] It really does.
: Wow.
": That is the Princeps, Riva that's gonna be your turn."
: Okay well originally I was just gonna be conservative and shield up and stay in the ship until you guys were 200 feet of me. But then Brennan pulled this hidden people nonsense. So I think Riva in Aguatunisian form is gonna pop into these three little guys by right by the docking bay.
: Hell yes.
: Just like poke their head out and see what is happening in this little cubby hole. See what nonsense is happening.
": Shooting out of the aquatic bowels of the Wurst Riva's gonna appear in one of these water bulbs, through the refueling system, back towards the gate, Riva, as you appear there, that's gonna be your movement to get there from inside the ship. What would you like to do once there?"
: Can I see anybody in this area at all? Can I make a perception check?
: Make a perception check if you'd be so kind.
: 17.
": You don't see anybody, but a 17 is pretty good. So you do from all the way out here, you can see other tiers on levels or rather you can see other docks on level seven, has a familiar ship docked in it."
: Oh no not the Lady Pike.
: The Lady Pike is docked at that bay right now.
: Damn.
: Oh boy.
": Not right now, no Jan."
: Everyone's trying to get us.
": How many, how many feet away is that?"
": That one's farther away, that docking bay is probably like about 800 feet away"
": Okay so it's not an immediate, right now."
": It doesn't look like an immediate right now threat, but you see it's fully docked there."
: Okay these guys over here are more than 90 feet away and I actually can't see them. So there's not much I can do. So I'm just gonna cast battle pre- cognition on myself to give myself an AC of 15.
: Hell yeah
": And wait, because I'm like just guarding the entrance, essentially."
": Cool, you cast battle pre-cognition you wait, if you want to measure your range to see where your like furthest spells can reach, that might not be a bad idea, but that's Riva's turn up next to the initiative order is gonna be your Jib-Job employees. Much like the end of Fantasy High season one where we were rolling for the Elmville PD to show up, Murph, if you'd be so kind."
: Got it!
: Yes.
: Oh why are we getting-
": Come on, I actually feel good about this one."
Brennan: You want to roll high.
: 13.
": Okay 13. Incredible, I want you to roll a d10."
: One.
: One.
": Okay, one Jib-Job employee shows up."
: Oh I thought that was gonna be how many rounds.
: One Jib-Job employee shows up.
: Out of 40? There are
": I believe there are no, there are 10 employees. There are 10 employees"
"so one of them shows up, and give me, roll me a d4."
": You got it, you guys ready for a one?"
: Four.
: Four.
": Okay, so four is what you wanted. One Jib-Job employee shows up right near the docking bay over right by Riva. You see sort of walking calmly up is a Jib-Job worker just sort of headed to the ship, and you see a Raymond Zam up on the deck of the ship, cock the laser pistol and say, Hey, Devin, a little faster bud, we've got a hot exit, and point the rifle down the dock, incredible."
: Kind of better than having where they have to crawl.
: Such a good point.
: Keeping them hidden.
: That'll be the next turn.
": Amazing, Margaret, that's gonna be you."
": Incredible. This is so scary to look at, I'm completely alone."
: I've got a spot for you on the scooter if we can get rid of this person by me.
": I was gonna ask you. Okay, cool. Can I, I am gonna use my critical analysis on the person who's on the scooter with Barry."
: Amazing
": And ready an action. So when you scoot closer, I think maybe I can attack them using my intelligence modifier, and maybe knock them off and get on with you."
": Hell yeah, if you want to, yes, so I will, so basically you want to, when Barry goes again, you're gonna use your athletics to replace the other person on the scooter. Incredible."
": And while I'm here, I know this is in the blink of an eye, but can I roll to like check, just look and see if my phone has notifications. I know that UFTP is looking for me and I want to just maybe do a perception check to see-"
: How bad it's gotten?
: Am I in huge trouble or are they here to protect me? They're probably here to protect me.
: We can pretend you're getting kidnapped.
: Let's do a luck check to see if they're here to protect them.
": because you asked, I will not even ask you to roll the perception. You take your phone out, getting ready to jump on the scooter. You have a, an alert from your bank account asking you to verify your credentials."
: Is it a phishing scam?
": Okay, I verify."
": What, you got phished."
": But you're using your action to ready, so as a bonus action, you open your phone."
": Okay, got it."
: You're made. UFTP is coming after your bank accounts. They're trying to freeze you out.
": Okay, cool. I make a mental note that I need to workshop some new names when we get back on the ship and, and I ready my action."
: Start a new account right now at a different bank and transfer your funds.
": You're right, instead, I use my action to come up with a captcha."
: If you want to do that-
": Which square has a bus in it, and."
": I'm not gonna lie to you, if you want to do that, if you want to start banking on your phone right now, that's not necessarily the worst idea in the world."
: 'Cause Barry can grab you.
: Barry can grab you.
": But then we still, then we have another dude with us, I'm gonna do that next turn."
": Okay, so you look at your phone, you see it's like, now here's the thing. You were smart enough, you don't have your money in the company store. It's a separate bank, what they're doing is illegal, but it's AnarchEra, what does that even mean? However, it's not like your bank is gonna necessarily like help UFTP so if you could transfer it, you can do some financial shenanigans to try and stop this from happening."
": Okay, that's my role on the ship, for sure. I will be taking care of that."
": Incredible, so Margaret phone in hand, ready to jump up and spin kick"
"this other Rec Pol Lieutenant off the scooter. That is gonna be the brigade. They're gonna come forward, getting some partial cover here, but I'm gonna say that because of this choke point, the five less injured ones are gonna do a full move through out here in the open because of that wall of fire they no longer can duck behind cover and fire through it. So they're gonna fully expose themselves out here, the more injured ones are gonna take the cover provided by this embankment."
": Very Stormtrooper energy right here,"
♪ For ranked we stand with thumbs of gold ♪
"And they rushed forward, of the brigades, they rush forward and start to open fire."
: It's just all on Margaret Encino.
": I mean, can we say that I hold up a UFTP badge, and they don't know yet."
": They look at you banking in front of them, it's very clear that they're here for Norman Takamori, They don't, again, one of the things that is, give me an insight check, actually."
: 18.
": An old piece of galactic wisdom that you heard at the Platinum Cog Leadership Summit back in the day filters down to you, which was told to you by an old very wise Rootersnoos ferret who said in this galaxy, there's always less going on than meets the eye, and it occurs to you that many people are coming after you, but they're not all coming after you all, and they don't all know the same stuff and they don't all talk to each other. Information is currency and you understand currency. These Amercadians look at you, you're not registered crew on the Skipper Norman Takamori's ship, but Barry is. So they are gonna open up on Barry."
: Right on. Here we go.
": [Emily] Barry's so beefy though, I'm not worried."
Murph: So thick.
: It's kind of a lot of people shooting.
: [Siobhan] I can use my drone as a heal.
: It's fine.
": Yeah, I think Barry bravely was like, hey don't go after her go after, oh all of you. All right, right on."
: Okay they rolled very low on the leadership die here. So the brigaders are gonna go first.
": This game is so fun, the leadership die. I love just all the new terms that we learn."
": It's great and Barry your armor class is a 15, correct?"
": It's not that good, yup."
: Are you in the zone?
: Oh I'm in the zone.
: The big sunglasses are on.
": That's two hits. And then this one here, it's another two. We're gonna roll for the sergeants here. Additionally though, I will say with access to the scooter, the scooter does have an ability to redirect, if the pilot takes damage from the source it is aware of and can see the construct can use its reaction to instead take that damage, so you can like wheel the scooter to be like a partial shield if you so choose."
": How much do I, I don't want to lose the scooter. The scooter is very important to Barry. I'm gonna take the hit."
: You're gonna take the hit.
: Unless I can somehow redirect it to use that ability to hit the dude behind me.
: It's like Cody.
": It's actually not a bad idea, right?"
: Yeah.
: Because we need the scooter.
": We kind of need the scooter, 'cause I'm just gonna, I have an ability that lets me go a little faster, but I need a bonus action."
: I think Brennan was dangling that knowing.
: Don't dangle that on me dude.
: Don't dangle on him.
: Don't dangle.
: Open fire on the clone marine.
: So that'll be-
": Halved,"
: That'll be 13.
: 13?
: 13 damage.
": Sweet. I'm gonna use a reaction and Barry tries to make it look cool, but he does his regeneration thing, which kind of like looks like he has to shit. He goes right on. (grunts) So I use a reaction to expend a hit die and get one back. That's eight."
": Eight, holy shit, so you took five damage from that whole squadron coming down on you, Jesus."
: Yeah that's the person we wanted to get shot by 20 people.
": He's so beefy, oh my god he's so beefy."
: You're so beefy.
: Stop everyone please.
: I make a mental note to add beefy to the next time I give a speech.
: Beefy!
": That's gonna be huge for the SEO, yeah absolutely. Incredible, that's the brigade, next in the order are the Repo Reapers."
": Have they seen me, do they know I'm there?"
: Yes they do.
: How would they know?
"Brennan: 'Cause you're like John Wayne-esque riding- Oh no. Wait a minute. No, I think they do have, yeah, they have line of sight to you."
: Gunnie's a baby.
: Although actually-
: Why don't you love me?
: From their vantage point.
: Okay we're getting to the other dividends.
": I'm like, I know that I didn't let Sid guard you, but she is completely in front of you."
": I'm like, I'm a short king, okay."
: Okay.
": Yeah, he's 4'11 and I'm 6'2."
: Really?
: I don't know.
: Is that big enough? Should she be bigger?
": So you see that,"
(all laughing)
"that this one of the Repo Reapers that is totally unarmed steps forward looks up and goes, oh Mr. Miggles-Rashbax, we're from Repo Reapers, we have great news. We're here to reduce your monthly minimums."
(machine whirring)
: Oh God.
: Did he just shit?
": Yeah, is that him shooting?"
: No that's him with a metallic saw.
: Oh.
: We're here to reduce your monthly minimums.
": I just start slapping the mastiff, go, go, go, go. Is this how you do it, I'm sorry."
": No, that's true, Aurora likes it a little rough. Get it, 'cause she's a dog."
: Okay.
": Oh R-U-F-F, thank you."
: I actually didn't mean it at the time though.
Brennan: All right.
: I'm retroactively renaming-
: I'm not here to rewrite history.
": Sid, you got attacks coming your way from one of these Repo Reapers."
": You know what I got an element of, I mean, I got a shield."
": Okay you throw a shield up, here we go, two attacks coming your way."
: I've got Aurora's bristles.
: Shield come up. Disruption rifle does not hit you at all. And another attack is gonna be incoming. I'm gonna need dexterity saving throws from both of you and Aurora Nebbins.
: How dare you.
: It's not an attack.
: It is not an attack.
": Dexterity saving throw, here's me."
": For you I'm gonna roll with this new shiny dice, you gave me that is a 22."
: I also got a 22!
: Why are you so disappointed?
": Well, I like my dice."
: 22.
: 22 for me. And then a 12 on a dice for Aurora.
: You see that one of the Repo Reapers with like this wild he's got like multiple piercings in his cheek and lips.
": Wait, heads up I can do, I can add a d4 to a roll of someone that I can see, line of sight, can I see Aurora?"
": You can see Aurora Nebbins, go ahead and roll that d4."
": Oh yeah, you."
": No, go for it."
: Four!
: Yes!
: 16 is the DC.
": Yes, yes, yes."
: So Margaret you're on your phone and you look up and see that Aurora has no idea that something is incoming.
": That's not right, let me text Aurora, slack Aurora."
": You see that Aurora's collar has a weird little orb in it and it goes (beeps) Aurora goes (yells) and all of you make the save. All of you dodging a minus two to AC, the slowed condition, and dodging a permanent reduction for the rest of the combat, you would not be able to take reactions or actions and bonus actions on your turn. All of you dodged that the cryogenic stasis coming in from this other bounty hunter, incredible. Nothing about that was likely to happen at all."
: Wow. Wow. Wow.
": UFTP agent drops to one knee, wakes, uses an action to, to wake up one of their companions and then bonus action, because they are all operatives is going to run and duck and hide for cover. So we now have two UFTP agents who dive behind this kiosk over here to get full cover. That's UFTP, Gunnie that goes back to you at the top of the order."
": [Lou] As these miraculous things happen on the back of Aurora, I look at Sid. Sid, is Aurora gonna be attacking next turn, or is it, are we just on the move?"
": Well I think that I'm gonna move her towards hostile creatures and then just kind of fake out. I hope that she runs them over, but we're just moving I think."
": Okay, great. Can I make an insight check? Do I think that the Repo"
Reapers will shoot at me?
": Because you asked, I will not even require a roll. You know, they're not here to damage the merchandise."
": I'm gonna crawl in front of Sid and just put my body in front of her. This is weird, but I know they won't, this is expensive stuff. They won't shoot at it."
: Oh my god.
: Just gonna run interference.
: Like a Jackie Chan movie where there's a priceless vase.
": No shooting, no shooting."
": I put my hands over your face though, to give you cover there."
": And they're like, boss we can't take the headshot and the goods, he's got the goods."
": There it is. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna use, I'm gonna do that. So I'll block, I'm in front of Sid, I'm gonna use, I have one more potent aptitude that I'm gonna give to Sid as well. You have a d4."
: Thank you in case I fuck up my animal handling.
": In case you need it. And then I'm gonna, I'm gonna repair myself. I think Gunnie with one hand is just gonna start to make some minor, like"
just get through it repairs.
": Okay, all right give me a mechanics kit check. If you want to do this in a way that doesn't void the warranty on modding your stuff."
: That's a Nat 20.
: The blue dice!
: You just jail broke it!
": Oh, that's-"
: You're so mad that these dice are rolling so good.
": I'm so mad at these. This is like when somebody is like, dad you really needed to upgrade. And you're like, oh, mine is fine."
: I don't know why we would ever fuck with Ally Beardsley's dice whispering powers. I don't know why we would ever do that.
: Beardsley blessed.
: Hashtag #BeardsleyBlessed hit it up in the comments.
: Ally is selling die they're $100 per-
": It's blessed like the priest, it's like the pope."
: You can truly clean up if you went into the dice business.
: Holy water and there's dice floating in it. And I ship it to you.
: Beardsley is to dice what the moon is to crystals.
: You're gonna roll a double on the healing die for that crit.
": That's a full 12, I'm back at max."
Murph: Max baby.
": You are, you open I'm gonna say like, yeah, you get in front, Sid's hand and also assault cannon covering your face and reach in and you've got a bunch of Acme-Ashmun repair kit stuff on a nat 20 you're like this is the stuff they give you in case there's an emergency, and you're good enough to repair yourself on the fly, body is back in working condition."
: Great.
": That's gonna be Rec Pol, they've taken the most hits, but they're still, they're still in this baby. The two on the ground are going to take shots at Barry."
: Yep that makes sense.
"Brennan: But because they're right underneath you, you do have cover from, I think- that's a critical failure that's gonna hit the scooter."
: Fuck.
: Aw damn.
": Your scooter takes seven points of damage, it is not down, but you can go and mark that on your sheet, as well. Your scooter, scooter seven points of damage and Rec Pols coming after you, with the cover is not gonna hit, the Lieutenant behind you on the scooter is gonna try to kick you off."
: Hilarious.
: The number you're trying to beat on this opposed athletics check.
: Unless I roll two nat ones?
: Unless you roll two nat ones.
: All right it's always possible.
: [Lou] It's already happened today.
: Nat 20!
: Yes!
": This guy, this guy lunges for you, and I'm gonna say without even using part of the action economy, you reach, grab, like do a reverse-"
: Stone Cold Stunner?
": Yeah Stone Cold Stunner, and flip the guy off the scooter without having to use an action."
": Hey, Margaret had an action prepared, didn't she?"
": Perfect, yeah then I'll have more?"
"Yeah, yeah, now I can do my banking."
: That's what I'm saying.
"Brennan: Incredible, yeah the Rec Pols are not really, if there's like a group huddle for all the people coming after you, after this, the Rec Pols are gonna be weirdly quiet in that meeting. Actually, wait you did have, you did have a readied action which is now, if you want to give me a finance check, give me intelligence plus this is gonna be a plus nine to this roll, and it's gonna be an opposed roll. The agents coming after you online are rolling a plus 10."
: Okay.
": Okay, they rolled a five you're trying to beat a 15."
": Ooh, 18."
": 18\. You, you are able to open an account, boom, to begin to transfer your money to like a pseudonym. This is your personal finances they're coming after, trying to shut you down, incredible. That's what you're able to do in one round is set that up at another, like, you know, wild off-planet account somewhere. That's your turn doing that? That's your readied action. Barry, that's your turn."
"Murph: Sweet, how fast does the scooter go?"
: This is fully a construct so you in effect no longer have your movement but this thing has a fly speed of 50-
: Rad.
": And it can, and it can dash and move."
: So I can go a hundred feet.
": That is correct, yes. You can go a hundred feet on this thing."
": So I'm gonna make a little line here I'm gonna go, would this put me in range of those agents?"
: You would be about and the Repo Reapers would be even closer than that.
": Sweet, then you know what, maybe I'll take cover on that building and kind of drop Marge off with the scooter."
: Hell yeah.
: Oh sick.
: And then I will hop off.
": Okay. So you're gonna drop off and also you see there's this depression, this little parking lot for the taxis back here, there is a depression here that you could get like three quarters, 'cause you'd be standing in essentially like a foxhole. So you could get three quarters cover there."
: Sweet.
"Brennan: Margaret Encino, Barry Syx, and the stolen Rec Pol scooter flash over to this corner of the sunken area over here, that's the scooter's movement. You have your action left."
": Sweet, I have there's all the knocked out agents?"
": Yes, I'm a hero, I shoot a burst into all of-"
: So they auto-fail.
: They auto-fail dex saves!
": I'm a hero, I love it."
": Marge, I hope you're cool with quitting."
": Absolutely, as I'm banking. I need one capital, one lower case."
": Okay, go ahead and roll damage for this burst."
": I only rolled a four, that's gonna be nine damage."
": Okay. (beams firing) You deal nine damage to all of them, which is not enough to put them down, and the damage brings them out of the stun condition."
": Right on. (beams firing) But you have three quarters cover in this depression that you're in, Margaret, you're also back down there. I'm gonna say that you fully like bring the scooter down."
": And then I'll bonus action because I have formation style. I will bonus action guard, Margaret."
: Thank you!
: Hell yes amazing.
: I fall in love with Barry.
: I instantly fall in love.
": Amazing, Talespire we can go ahead and have those putty mongers continue fleeing in all directions."
: What's this?
: This is to see how the putty factory's doing. You want to high number.
": Yeah, I know, I know."
": It's all good, nat 20."
: Nat 20.
": It's a seven, not a five or lower. I'm going to need a dexterity save from everybody here."
: Everybody.
: What?
: Including me?
": No, not you, sorry."
: 16 for me.
: 16?
: 11.
: 11.
": 14 for me, 18 for Aurora."
: I got a cocked nat 20 but then a 17.
Brennan: Margaret?
": That is a high for sure, dex is uh, 19."
: Did anyone get below a 12?
": Yes, don't I, do I get advantage on dex saves I can see!"
": Yep absolutely, this is a dex save you can see."
": Doesn't matter, oh wait, what did I need to beat?"
: 12.
: 12.
: I got a 12.
: Nice!
": All right you step out of the way, you see Pleasure Putty raining from the sky hits some of the Rec Pols, hits some of the brigaders and you see that it hits them, they're like, you know, they're like, all right, soldiers after those, oh no, no, no. (all laugh) Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
: Do any of us want to see a cop cum? (all laugh)
": It's a kink, it's a kink."
: Is this a new search for me?
": Doesn't appear to deal any damage at the moment, but also a lot of people got hit with it, it is partially flammable, so there's a danger component."
: Okay.
": Okay, okay."
: Good to know.
": I already used my, I don't have anymore incendiary grenades."
: Amazing.
: Next time we go shopping.
": That is back to Skip, Sid, and Aurora Nebbins."
Zac: Whatcha doing?
: I'm just gonna make a beeline and get and just get as far as possible.
": Okay, I think Skip has his, his basically lizard brain blood lust, and is going to just like drop down with the Princeps to where these guys are that were just hit by the burst."
": Oh, hell yes."
": We're heroes, Skip."
": I'm a hero because my ally's with me, I get sneak attack, right?"
": Oh, the Princeps can absolutely grant you sneak attack on these agents, yes, yes, yes."
": So I'm just gonna take like one of those three, I'm just gonna hit, and what I add a d4 with the Princep?"
": You add a d4 to all these attack rolls. As they enter, as the Princeps comes down with you, you also see that all these agents react, like there is a psychic disruption from the Princeps being this close to all them."
: Hell yeah.
": Okay, that is a 16 on the die plus seven to hit, 23."
": Oh absolutely hit, yes."
: Okay and so I'm using the Vibro-rapier.
": Hell yeah, I'm gonna flavor this, basically you take out this little like vibrating krystal dagger that you've got that, roll damage for it like a rapier."
": That's six damage on the die, I forget what I add to the dagger in terms of just like-"
": So there would be, it would be a d6 for sneak attack, a d4 for the dagger, and then you would add plus five, your dex modifier."
": Okay, great, so that would be another that's so 11 damage."
": You deal 11 damage, you dealt nine right?"
: I believe so.
: Yeah.
: Yeah.
: Not down.
: Not down?
: Not down.
: As a reaction I'm using guerrilla style to disengage and then how much movement is that?
": Oh I add, when I'm in this zone I do want extra two for rage if that does anything."
: Copy that you've done an extra two damage still not down.
: So they all took 11.
": They took 11, you just dealt how much again?"
Zac: 11.
": Okay they not, this one in front of you is not down."
": So that's as much damage as I can do this turn, so I'm gonna, this is, let me sorry, let me measure the distance from there to here. So that's 30 feet down there. So did the damage as a reaction I'm disengaging."
: Hell yeah.
: And then bonus action dash up here to be above them again.
"Brennan: Oh, hell yeah."
: On top of this kiosk that the other guys hid in.
": Oh, hell yeah, you can jump up there and absolutely grab full cover. You guys, so you see that as these UFTP agents, wait a minute, sorry. You give me one other attack roll if you'd be so kind against that person, because they haven't had a chance to stand up yet, which means that they are-"
: Oh.
": That you actually would have advantage on that roll, you might crit."
": I did not crit, but it would have hit."
"Brennan: Cool, gotcha, cool, cool, cool. Just, just being as diligent as possible, so all that you see this sick move still with the Princeps in one arm, the captain looks incredibly heroic as you say, I'm a hero, 'cause you literally you've got like alien royal in one arm with your sick captain Jack in the jet pack, you just like Rocketeer-style just bound down from the roof slit across this dude's chest-"
: You're essentially Zorro with a jet pack.
"Brennan: And you disengage, no attacks of opportunity, and make it up with full cover on the next roof."
: Woo.
": Amazing, Sid."
": Okay. So I'm gonna use the bonus action, Aurora's bonus action to move towards the hostile repo men."
: Hell yeah.
": But then I'm going to then use Aurora's movement to basically get, I think I'm gonna go past this putty person again, but while I'm going by, I'm gonna go after like over my shoulder, I'm gonna shoot these repo men and also throw a grenade at them."
": Hell yeah, okay. So you're gonna use, sorry, but let me be clear you're gonna use Aurora's aggressive ability to get that bonus action move."
: Yeah.
": Go ahead and give me an animal handling check, 'cause she gets really excited."
": Come on, girl."
": 19 on the dice, a 19 and a 17, so plus one, 20, dirty 20."
: So you use this thing-
": Girl, I think we're getting better together."
": Yeah, you see her she gets really excited. Like, okay, go get him, and she bow! Like adrenal burst of this just powerful charging gallop, and then you yank hard to the left, her head moves to the side."
": And then basically once we're like mid her movement, I want to throw a grenade at the three of them. I'm just gonna do, 'cause I'm out of all the cool ones I'm gonna do, and I'm gonna save the stun, I'm gonna do just a regular plasma grenade at the three of them, and then I'm gonna shoot one of them."
": Aurora Nebbins is taking and let's go ahead, We'll roll their dex saves for this plasma grenade, which I believe is DC 14."
: Yep.
: Amazing.
: Should I deposit the money in this money...?
: There are people in there.
": Okay, one failure."
": Okay, on a failed save they take 16 plasma damage and on a successful save they take eight plasma damage."
": Okay, this far Repo Reaper on the end's taking a full 16 damage. The other two are each taking eight and you can go ahead and take your attacks with your assault cannon."
": Okay, I'm actually gonna do, I'm actually gonna do a storming shot."
": Storming shot is, that's not, is that a deployment ability or is that a?"
: It's like a zero level thing?
": Oh it's full character, a tech power, gotcha, cool, cool."
": And use my weapon expert. Okay, does a, I think, it's gonna hit does a dirty 20 hit?"
: Dirty 20 hits.
": Okay, so I do. I'm gonna"
: it's so tempting. How fucked up do they look?
": They don't look too fucked up from that plasma grenade. These I will say in, in ascending order, you would say that the UFTP agents are about twice as scary as the Rec Pol people. These Repo Reapers are about twice as scary as the UFTP people."
: Oh I totally misjudged them.
"Brennan: You look at them covered in like the Repo Reapers hunt cyborgs, they hunt people that are incredibly strapped with technological prowess and powers."
: Then I am spending my kinetic die to add to my AC.
: Cool.
: So I have a plus four to my AC.
: Holy shit.
": I'm now at 19 AC. And then they take only six damage, six energy damage, but they're also shocked until the end of my next turn. So I think shocked means you can only take a action?"
": Or bonus action, yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing."
: Just to one of them.
": And are you going for the one in the middle? The one or the one, one of the ones on either end?"
: Who looks scariest? Who looks like they can really like maximize their action economy.
": The two that look the best at fighting, you see that there looks like there's a manager and two technicians here."
": Two technicians, Gunnie, who am I going for?"
: The one with a saw.
: I go for the one with the saw.
": Hell yeah, you go for the one with the saw. That's I believe that's the already injured one on the end here. So that's gonna be another six points of damage, and that character suffers the shocked condition. Give me one other animal handling check as well."
: Okay... Another fucking 19!
": This time, Aurora bounds over the putty monger. (all cheering)"
": And then I think since my AC is so boosted now, because I'm gonna be able to shield and get up super high. I think I'm gonna like make sure that I'm covering or like, you know, kind of flip around."
"Brennan: Okay Aurora Nebbins is bounding You can see the ramp of the Wurst right ahead of you, you see Raymond looking down and being like, way to go, incredible work out there, we're waiting on a few other people, and that's Sid's turn."
"Sidney: Gunnie, is it wrong that the Jib-Job people are not my priority right now?"
"Gunnie: It's like on like on a spiritual level, perfectly fine, on a fiscal level, we need to wait."
: From so far you can barely hear my voice go that's right Gunnie!
Brennan: Incredible.
Sidney: I just can't bring myself to care about them.
: Spiritual v. Fiscal.
"Gunnie: And all the soul with, with regard to you and us, that's totally cool, we need that money. We gotta, I mean, you know, we didn't buy kitchen utensils, but we found them and we gotta make it worth our while."
Murph: So it's gonna be nat 20.
: Nat 20s nonstop.
"Murph: 10 on a d10, and a four on where they show up."
"Brennan: You see Princeps Zortch attempt, they reached out their hand and attempt to do something to the Repo Reapers underneath them does not seem to succeed, but you see that some psychic waves are blasting out from the Princeps, that is now gonna be a Riva."
": Okay, here is my thought, but this is."
"Ally: I'm so sorry to interrupt, but that's literally Grimes and Elon Musk. Prove me wrong. Norman and the Princeps Zortch together are Grimes and Elon."
"Siobhan: Elon does have a cosmic worm inside his brain, so."
": Obsessed with you team, you guys do incredible work."
"Siobhan: So when we get to the ship, we're gonna get, want to get to into FTL, faster than light, as soon as possible, which involves Gunnie doing math, so here is my thought is that we want to get Gunnie into the ship as quickly as possible, but we also probably want Aurora down here to guard the entranceway to stop people from getting into the ship. So if, and I'm assuming that Gunnie being four foot 10 counts as a small-"
: 11.
"Siobhan: 4 foot 11, I apologize."
"Brennan: I love the case that we're building here, this feels fun to me."
: Call me a small creature?
: A small creature.
": Hey, this has been fun, I've had a great time playing with all of you."
"Siobhan: So in conclusion, can I psychically throw Gunnie"
Brennan: Is that how far you can throw a small creature?
Siobhan: That's how far I can throw a small creature.
"Ally: Gunnie, you're baby, okay there's nothing wrong with that."
Zac: Gunnie is a baby.
": I think it's a good move, it's getting Gunnie even further from his repo people."
"Siobhan: And then Aurora can focus on fighting people, and Gunnie can focus on getting us the fuck out of here."
"Brennan: Now I'm gonna go ahead and say something real quick, I'll say this Gunnie is not a small creature, Gunnie can become a small creature."
Zac: Take a piece off.
"Brennan: You have an engine in your pelvis that can run your legs independently of your torso, arms and head."
": Do it, do it, do it. I hit the, I mean, if Riva can talk to me, I don't like doing this, but I'm happy to."
"Brennan: So Sid, you're galloping."
Sidney: Don't worry Gunnie I gotcha.
"Gunnie: Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: You see in this bulb, like is glass bulb water tower you see Riva summoning full psychic power, and Gunnie."
"Gunnie: Goddamn it, click, click."
Brennan: Your torso is lifted with psychic telekinesis.
Gunnie: Take care of my legs!
: I clutch them.
"Siobhan: Hang on a second, so I can only get you 60 feet, which is only halfway to the ship by doing this, so as funny as that just was, maybe the better option is if I use psychic push pull on this taxi right here, and I use the taxi to get Gunnie to the ship."
": Wait how, what's my movement when I'm just the torso?"
"Brennan: If you continue to use this psychic power on your next turn, you will not ever at any point discard Gunnie, you'll be continuously like moving him, and he'll be able to also like, additionally, move himself under his own power on his turn."
: I'm about this.
Ally: So you won't even hit the ground.
"Brennan: So you effectively, you have some adjusters on your back for when you're traveling in zero grav, with the fact that you are now neutrally buoyant on the Rec Station's gravity, because Riva is telekinetically moving you, you can assist with your own boosters your movement, plus Riva's movement is gonna get you to the ship super fast."
"Siobhan: Great and I'm also gonna use quicken spell, or quicken power to use psychic push pull, which moves him an extra 10 feet that's 40 feet of movement, uh 70 feet of movement."
"Brennan: Ah, so Gunnie you, yeah, you disconnect from your legs, feel yourself being telekinetically being moved forward as you hit your thrusters, you zoom, you zoom past the intersection. as you zoom past the intersection because you are not being moved under your own power, we're gonna apply attack of opportunity rules because that doesn't get, attacks of opportunity don't get triggered when you are moved by someone else's ability, which means that rounding the corner, Jan De La Vega does not get a shot off on you."
: Just my torso.
": You see, you see, you hear, well, well what the hell is this? I got a bone to pick with you."
": Fuck you! Not right now, Jan!"
": Now it is Jib-Job workers, again."
: We got this.
: We got this.
: Guaranteed.
: It's a nat 20! (all cheering)
: Oh my God. Nat 20.
": Hell yeah man, hell yeah."
": Here's what we're gonna do, go ahead roll four d10. Take the highest roll on the die. A nine or a 10 on any of these four mean all of the rest of your Jib- Job workers arrived."
": Come on, come on."
: Nine!
: Nine? All of them arrived now roll four d4.
: Okay.
": You can take the highest roll on the board. This is where they place on the board, you want a four."
: Okay.
": Four, isn't it?"
": No, that's a two and a one, another two and a one."
": Okay, so."
: Two is better probably.
": Two is better, you're gonna take the two. Okay, you guys see basically one of these taxis pulls up at intersection number two, but on that crit we're gonna allow the Jib-Job workers to move on the turn they arrive."
: Oh sick.
: Yeah.
": So you guys see a taxi roll up at that intersection number two, back by the money changing kiosk, so literally the Repo Reapers are all like Miggles- Rashbax, you can run, but you can't, and the little taxi pulls up and nine people that split like a ride share, rush out, and they're like, all right guys, hot exit, let's hoof it."
: I love how common this feels.
: That was the best crit of the season so far.
": Yes, yes."
": Way to go Murph. Yeah, you see nine graphic designers, screenwriters and assistants all begin to hoof down the, all begin to hoof it down. The Jib- Jobbers jumped out of their cab and are already like about 15 feet behind Aurora Nebbins. You see, they've got like briefcases and datapads and are kind of doing serpentine and keeping low. They've done hot exits before."
": I think I look at them and I say, good news Jib-Jobbers, we got a shuttle, and I gesture to Aurora."
": Unbelievable, okay. And you see also the, as the Jib-Jobbers arrive, Raymond Zam says, oh, thank goodness, and begins to provide cover. Meaning that all of those Jib-Jobbers have advantage on dex saves. And there's all opponents have disadvantage on attacks made against them because Raymond is providing cover for all of them."
: So they're 15 feet behind?
": Behind Aurora Nebbins they still got some, they still got to clear it to the ship. That's Jib-Job, Margaret Encino, that's you."
": Fabulous, I can fly this thing right? Do you want to be back on it, Barry? You're kind of far back."
": Yeah, for sure."
": Okay, cool so I fly me and Barry, how many feet of movement is that?"
": So you're on a construct that can do the dashing for you. You can move a hundred on this thing right now, if you want to use your action to try to get as much of your money into that new account as possible."
": Yeah, definitely, I also have like a retirement, like can I try to get some extra money from like?"
Siobhan: Get out of your 401k?
": So here's so here's what it's gonna be, ready?"
: It was matching.
: It was like the 3matching which was pretty big for me.
": It's a contested roll. We're gonna do this honestly, for the first time in this combat, we're bringing up the Box of Doom."
: For money!
: For banking!
": For banking, it's a contested roll. We know they add a plus ten to this. If you beat their roll, your checking account, which is the money that you've been spending thus far transfers to this new encrypted account that you built on the last turn. If you can beat their roll by five, you can cash out some of your stock. If you can beat it by 10, your pension comes with it."
: Let's go. Let's go.
": I'm gonna roll first. It's a contested roll. I'll remind you that you also have measured action, which means that you can add a d4 to contested rolls."
: Yes.
": I think you do have superiority die left, right?"
": I do. Yeah, yeah."
": All right, here's the roll they add a ten to this. That's a natural two."
: Yes it is!
: Get over here get over here.
": So hard to see my ex after quarantine, but hi baby. That's maybe an 11?"
: That is an 11.
": Okay, cool, with a nine that's a dirty 20."
: Okay dirty 20 and they got on the 2-
: Roll that superiority die so you can get the 10.
": Yeah, so they got a 12 I got a 20."
": So hold on one second, so yeah, they got a 12 you got a 20."
": I have to have it hit two or higher to get all of my money, come on team. Fuck."
": It's a three! Holy shit! Unbelievable Margaret Encino, in your- Here's your die, dice deity Ally Beardsley does it again. You guys swing back to get the cover here, as you jump back on this thing, this thing has already moved this round because of Barry's turn, you can saddle up on the scooter, but it's got to move again on Barry's turn, right, so moving again on Barry's turn, however you get under the scooter, hover it back up in that seat, get on your phone. You can see the account's trying to cancel out verification codes coming in. You go on your phone, you take a beating because your stocks are not supposed to vest for another five years, but your pension, all your 401k, all your UFTP stuff zeroes out and boom that money vanishes."
: How much was it? How much was it Brennan?
: You beat the roll by How many years have you been working at United Free Trade Planets?
": I mean I am 24, but I'm a savant, so I would imagine I started at 18, so six?"
": You've been working there for six years, cool. Go ahead and roll six d4, one for each year."
": Okay, great."
": That's four, that's five so nine, that's another five, so 14."
": All of your money is saved, so anything that you have in your character sheet is saved. Cashing out your stocks, cashing out your pension, three ribecs before your termination notice hits your inbox and you lose access to your UFTP account, you cash your stocks, cash your pension,"
": Incredible, incredible."
: 14.000 credits hits.
: Beautiful.
Siobhan: Thank god you checked your phone.
": All right baby, yeah exactly, honey, we're up to not including whatever the fuck is on that."
": I cannot believe, you have spent this entire combat banking, and it was the far and away most advisable thing you could've been doing during this and like momentarily to be like heads up, you're about to get hit."
": Barry doesn't know why, but I'm just squeezing your shoulders, we did it!"
": I shot those guys that were down, did you see that?"
: Definitely.
": Unbelievable, okay. After Margaret, that is now gonna be the brigade. Let's see what they can do. The brigade surges forward in a tight cluster. They're trying to get line of fire on Barry and Margaret."
": Can I, I've as a bonus action last time, can we say that I switched my critical analysis to Barry?"
: Hell yeah.
: It's a bonus action.
": Awesome, yes, yes, yes, absolutely."
: So you're gonna get plus five to any attack save or check.
: Rad.
": Amazing, okay."
": Barry, you take 21 points of energy damage from the brigade firing on you. Margaret, you get hit twice."
: Guard.
": Oh, that's right, they have disadvantage, right?"
": Yeah, I think so. Is that, is that what the mechanic does?"
": Yeah, yeah, yeah."
: And then if they hit.
": And then if they hit, hold on. Okay, only one hits."
": Okay, when I'm guarding someone and I decide to take the hit, they have to roll the damage it's not autocrit."
: Okay. Gotcha.
: So I'll take the damage.
": Okay you take another six, halved to three points of damage, Barry, as you do that, get on, get on the scooter, Barry wheels around and takes an energy beam for you."
: Wow that would have been half of my hit points. Thank you so much.
": I'm actually kind of hurt now. And I had to use a reaction, right? To- so even though I'm using a bonus action to guard using the guard is a reaction, right?"
": You can, because they haven't hit you, no action required."
": Rad, then I will reaction heal myself."
: Go for it.
: Are you shitting on me?
": No, no, no Margaret."
": Yeah, whatever you see that, whatever, like you haven't seen before, Barry is not just a dude. He's a super soldier like there's this weird clone energy coming here. He's like healing incredibly fast."
": So you're like (grunt) and then you smile really big. And I'm like, okay."
": How much, how much was that?"
: Just four.
": Just four, okay. The brigade continues to fire on you, that is the brigade. Now it's gonna be the Repo Reapers."
: Excuse me.
: Repo Reapers?
: I'm not familiar.
: Repo Reapers are gonna move to the center of the dock here coming right down the lane. One of them is shocked.
: Don't let them get my legs.
": No, one's getting your legs Gunnie, no one."
: My legs have never been safer.
: I throw them around my neck like a scarf. Trust me your legs have never been safer.
": And your legs are still on the thing so they were good. They can't even fireball, they can't even do an explosion on you. 'cause they're trying to get those legs. They okay, they're gonna take shots on Sidney. They're gonna take shots on Sidney."
": I'm gonna shield. So my AC is now 24 'cause I rolled a four of my kinetic die a boost it up, and I'm gonna say that the extra four comes from Gunnie's legs, yeah."
: Scarfed with his legs.
": Try and hit me bitch, I'm wearing a scarf."
"Siobhan: He's just a rando, in front of Knick's Knacks. I think he's new."
: I love the guy in front of the Emporium.
": Yeah, with the big hat."
": I know if I hadn't been thrown forward, me and him would have a talk."
: Can I force throw his hat on to Sid so she can have his hat?
: I would look good in a top hat.
: You'd look really good in the top hat.
: That's the rebrand.
": I think I say as I move from a, as I move from a personal assistant to an emcee of a carnival."
: Wow okay six disrupter rifle shots get fired on you from the Repo Reapers. Only one hits.
: Oh man.
Brennan: You do take
": Okay I'm gonna roll concentration on my enhance android, nat 20."
: Hell yeah!
": Nat 20 to concentrate on, I'm in the flow state with my baby."
": I gonna go ahead and say, I'm gonna go ahead and say that you and you see that Aurora Nebbins goes (Aurora trills) solid, in its solid yellow eyes you see trace flecks of Borinyum krystal, this creature, this type of dog, must've grown up on asteroids and has something similar to your krystalline consciousness, and it bonds with you this moment."
": I just want to say for the record, I did not seek out a familiar in the campaign, the dice made this happen. I love you."
": That is the Repo Reapers, that's their turn, United Free Trade Planets agents are gonna go. God, you've got a lot of people coming after you. The ones remaining out here are all gonna duck back into this kiosk. So they all vanish underneath the awning here and are gonna take shots against Barry."
: Barry.
: Barry.
: How's Barry looking right now?
: Barry's at 25.
": Okay, cool, cool."
: Oh that's way more than I've got.
": Well 'cause the reaction healing. The first one, I got eight back, second one I only got four, so it's only it's diminishing returns."
: Give me a perception check if you'd be so kind.
: Great.
: Where's Barry?
: 14.
: Okay.
": I don't know if you want to add the five to that, but you can add it to anything, it might be better for something else."
: I might want to save it for a save or something.
": Cool, cool."
: Just keep the 14.
": Cool keep the 14, the operatives dip into the kiosk, take a bunch of cunning actions. So three of them are gonna get sneak attack on you."
": Oh fuck yeah I should've done that. Oh, well."
: AC is still-
": 15, but I have three quarters cover, right?"
": Yes you do, so three quarters is plus five. So that's gonna be, you're at a dirty 20, but three of them are gonna be attacking with advantage. Oh, you might be a very lucky clone my friend."
: Big lucky boy.
: The biggest luckiest-
: You're a big lucky boy.
": Thank god, because I was really regretting not-"
: You are not within close range for them. You are within distant range. So the three that are sneak attacking you don't get sneak attack because they're too far away.
: Got it.
": But they are still gonna get advantage because they're attacking from the hiding so it cancels out so they're gonna roll straight. Here's them rolling straight. That's gonna be one hit for sure, and then the last two that you spot roll with disadvantage, it's gonna be a miss, it's gonna be a miss, careful tactical decisions have just saved you a lot of pain, you take six points of damage halved."
: All right.
: Nice!
": Cover is king, okay. That is the end of the round. We go back to the top of the order Gunnie that's you."
": Great, I like to use my back thrusters to start moving my torso."
Brennan: What's this?
": Or just yes, it's I don't have a, it's not a cool thing. It's a small thing. I just want to keep moving toward the ship. I don't also have a jet pack."
: Do you still have like
": Yeah, yeah, you still have 30 feet of movement."
: That's rad.
": So I'll start, I'll use a full dash to get as close to the ship as I can, and then because I'm not using the math computer and just doing it by hand, can I start doing calculations on my datapad?"
": The ship's navigational computers would get, let you do it as a bonus action. If you wanna use an action, you can absolutely start now."
": Okay, how far can I get with 30 feet and am I still being pushed pulled, or that's over it's now just me?"
: I believe-
: I can push pull you the next 10.
: Can we also say that-
: The most important thing is to get you inside the ship.
: Can we also say that Gunnie grabbed Handy Annie?
": Yeah, we traded, take my leg."
": Yes, honestly, because that moment is so charming you do a leg for hand swap."
": Hey, thank you."
: Cool.
": If you want to just take 30 feet of movement, you can continue down so Gunnie is only gonna get 30 feet down the track."
: Yes.
": Now you are making this roll with advantage. You're taking your action to do it. You get your wrist pad up, you start making the FTL tachyon drive checks."
": Yeah, that's gonna be it's proficiency plus intelligence?"
"Brennan: Oh, sorry I forget though, because you're not using the Navcom, it is still a roll with disadvantage, so it's straight because Handy Annie is giving advantage so the straight roll. Let's go, we're gonna run here real quick."
": Use the blue die please, I'm begging you."
"Murph: You have to, you must."
": Okay, what is your check with your mechanics kit?"
: Proficient.
": So your proficient plus intelligence, yes."
: Okay.
: Let me know what you get straight roll.
": That's a 12 plus seven, 19."
": A 19, cool. Any other shenanigans?"
: Not from me. No.
"Brennan: On your wrist pad flying through the air just torso, arms, and head. You complete two of the necessary 10 equations, right? That's your action and movement, Rec Pol, what are we doing?"
": Just get out of here my guys, this fight is too strong for you."
: They start rolling in the Pleasure Putty.
"Brennan: Honestly, no you know what, they do still have shots on Barry who stole their scooter."
: Oh my god.
: You shouldn't have taken their scooter.
Murph: I'm borrowing it!
Brennan: So Rec Pol are gonna go join the Amercadian brigaders here. They are gonna fire on Barry as well.
: Rad.
: Here we go.
": Do they, do I still have cover?"
": From this angle you don't have cover on it, these guys are gonna go here. Holy shit, some historically bad rolls."
: We love historically bad rolls.
: Nice.
: Make history.
": Okay, five plus four. You take nine halved to four points of damage. Margaret, you are seeing Barry take a extreme, he's just being riddled with laser beams. That is going, that is the Rec Pols' turn. Then Barry Number Syx, that's you?"
: We need to go.
": Yes, we need to get the fuck out of here."
": Smiling, but like a tear coming out, I'm hurt. I would like to go, oh shit. I can do some cool stuff. I can do some really cool stuff. I want to just use the speeder bike thing to go a hundred feet. That's as fast as I can go right on it? Okay, so just get as far to the dock as I can."
: Okay so you and Margaret are on the speeder bike and you shoot a hundred feet down the course.
": Can we get like, almost like between where the wanted sign is right near where the scooter is."
: You want to try to grab?
: Right between the two buildings.
": You know what, give me, I will say this, we'll call it a DC 10 piloting check for you to get the scooter up behind that screen perfectly."
": Oh 'cause I can like fly. Oh my God, what is, is that intelligence?"
": That is intelligence, but are you proficient or no?"
": Don't I have plus five to something that I didn't use on the perception? Yes you do, this could be it, DC 10."
": Please, come on please... With the plus five is 14."
": Hell yes baby, would have failed without it. So Barry, you get behind Margaret you're on your phone, on the back and just pointing out like you're just like pointing out what the controls on the scooter do to Barry. You get on this hog and you take off and you like get up and use the hover to go off the windows. You're just basically, you're flying evasively the entire trip down you're like getting behind cover as lasers are shooting past you. So you're gonna have cover. You're gonna have total cover from anyone far away from you behind you."
": Rad, do any of these Repo Reapers look hurt?"
": Yeah, Sid injured them, yes."
": Okay I'll bonus action again, to have the option to guard Marge."
Brennan: Cool.
: And then I'll just shoot another burst into these dudes. Why not?
: Hell yeah.
": They roll, not me."
: Go ahead and roll damage though.
: 10 damage.
: Did you add your rage?
: I added my rage.
: Okay so both of the technicians here amongst the Repo Reapers take 10 damage and their supervisor takes five points of damage. I believe power cell goes empty in that gun?
": I'm done on, I need to reload that one."
: That's something I can do with my action? Can I?
: Yeah.
: The things that I needed to do was a little bit of banking and I've got that covered.
": Right, you were banking back there."
": I can reload, or-"
: I definitely thought you were on socials.
": Yeah I responded to an ex's story, but I also got some banking done."
"Brennan: Barry, that's your turn."
: We're just looking at a giant picture of Norm in front of us.
": Yeah, wanted, wanted, and you also see Norm flying with a jet pack and the Princeps' like right past the, you see Jan De La Vega looks at you and says, if that ain't the android that tried to cut a hole in the Lady Pike. Well, let's see how you like it, sister."
": She's hot again, she's hot again."
": Here we go, Jan de La Vega's gonna mark you as her quarry."
: Lucky.
: I think I just want to say to Jan like I don't want to fight you.
: I don't want to fight me either.
": Oh, the hits keep coming."
": I'm just saying, keep in mind if I do something. If I do something, you know, courteous and polite, you might want to file that away under your first impressions of us."
": She's gonna take two attacks you've got a 24 AC, that is unreal. One hit. That's gonna be, that is gonna be nine points of damage to Sid."
: I'm down.
: She looks up at you.
": I look at her and before the power goes out of my eyes, I say I was the only gonna stun and disarm you."
": Well, I'm mean as hell."
: Keep talking Jan.
: Needles is going to step forward and open fire on Gunnie.
": What a dick, shield or do I need to, no your face is, your mouth is open, which is like-"
: Bad or good?
": Yeah it's one of the other, but I feel like it's bad."
: He's sad.
": No, he's excited."
: You might as well shield.
: Shield.
": You throw up, covered in a momentary force bubble both attacks miss due to the shield."
": I was gonna say, distinct smile."
": Yeah, Sid goes down."
": My legs can't cast spells, I'm assuming?"
": No, legs can't cast spells, legs can't cast spells."
: Wait the real feet? The real feet can't cast spells?
": Brennan you're such a hardcore DM. Legs can't cast spells? Okay a nicer DM would've let him, Murph would have let us."
: Murph would you have let the legs cast spells?
": Of course, of course."
: Really?
": Murph is a really good DM, it's something to think about. It's kind of inspiring."
: I let my players just do whatever they want.
": Famously, famously."
: Cybernetic legs just like putting me in a healing choke hold.
: You get caught right in the crook of my knee.
: It's like Famke Janssen in Goldeneye.
: Like a little pinkie toe heals you.
": Oh, okay putty mongers continue to flee. We're rolling another luck check you don't want. Well, it was bad before, now you don't want a one through seven."
: Do we still make any sort of check or are we-?
": All good. No you hear more disruption coming from inside the putty factory and I will say that the number bumps up now too, you don't want a one through nine the next time we get there, it is the next turn. First of all, death save from Sid."
: Nat 20.
": No, you didn't."
": Yes, it bounced around so many fucking times and landed on nat 20, unbelievable. Look at it, kiss it."
": Kiss the ring, Brennan."
": Give it a kiss, that was the drama."
: Kiss my fucking die.
: Kiss it. Brennan it's right there give it a kiss.
: Whenever you're ready kiss it.
: Give it a long deep kiss.
: Tongue and everything.
: Kiss it.
: Rick Perry gave me these dice too.
": Hey Rick, thanks man. I wonder how it'll roll now. Oh my God, okay. So I'm gonna say this, so Sid you say that to Jan de La Vega, huge like space rangers like laser rifle, it hits you square in the jaw, lithium, endless consciousness, Aurora Nebbins licks your face something you've never known that was possible for you to do, and you hear a voice say, okay, my idea for this droid is that she can do anything. You are back at one hit point with your turn ahead of you."
": I wasn't made to do everything I was made to do anything, and as I say that I come to and I huck my final stun grenade at Jan and the lizard."
": Oh my God, okay."
": Hello, just, just popping up with a grenade."
": Unbelievable, unbelievable."
: That's actually kind of rocking me.
": I truly, I actually truly can't believe it. What?"
: Everything to anything is very beautiful.
": With a triumphant roar Aurora Nebbins rears up, you huck the grenade. This is absolutely gonna be Box of Doom, absolutely gonna be Box of Doom. This is, this is constitution, correct?"
: Yeah DC 14 constitution.
": DC 14 Constitution, holy shit. Jan and Needles are incredibly dangerous, they make this on a 12 or higher. Needles goes down, Jan stays up. You see grenade goes off, Needles goes fully stunned, you see that Jan hits a button on the arm of her like cybertronic wheelchair and a momentary like blackout shield of hologram energy covers her, nice try sweetheart, that's a pretty neat trick."
": Oh, that was just a Bonus action, and now I'm guess I'm gonna try it 'cause I'm really, I'm sticking to what I said. I'm not trying to start a fight with them. I'm gonna try to, I'm gonna use the hostile movement to try to like jump over this."
": Oh, hell yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. This is difficult terrain. You go ahead and make an athletics check for Aurora Nebbins to see if she can just leap the difficult terrain."
: Can I add the potent aptitude to do that?
: Sure you can do that.
: It's just a seven.
": Seven, cool, so it's gonna, if you if you make it a beeline for Jan, this is going to count as difficult terrain, but it would still be a bonus action, it'd still be extra movement."
: Yeah okay. Yeah I'm gonna do that anyways. I just need to get in range to cast. I'm gonna as my action try to disarm Jan.
": Hell yeah okay. So 25 feet is the bonus action for Aurora Nebbins, which gets you sort of on top of this rubble, kind of like right here. So Aurora Nebbins scrambles over the broken rock from the exploding factory. Go ahead and dis- what kind of a check is disarm?"
": Disarm, I think in the excitement I dropped it."
: It's either strength or dexterity and they get to choose.
": Copy that, Jan is gonna go dex, absolutely. DC's 14 on this?"
: Yeah.
": You go to hit the magnet and you see that Jan looks and you see Jan goes, my rifle! It goes and it shoots out and snaps taught on a chain to her wheelchair, and says nice try kiddo."
: I am just trying to show you that I'm polite and I'm not the person that you want to be fighting.
: Gimme a little persuasion check.
: Yes.
": Oh, 19."
": See she looks at you and says, how long was your contract on the Red Hot?"
": You know I'm gonna get back to you on that one. And then I'm gonna use the rest of movement to go as far, and I, if I have enough movement, I want to try and get behind cover 'cause I have one hit point."
": Yeah, Jesus no kidding. Okay yeah. Aurora is gonna take off. Jan's not armed with a melee weapon, so can't take the attack of opportunity there. So Aurora is gonna take now a hundred feet of movement down the dock towards the ship which I think is gonna bring you pretty much right next to Gunnie, right? Yeah."
: Toss me my legs!
": I chuck your legs, and then if I can get around that corner to get cover?"
": Yes, you can duck for cover behind that gate right there. Absolutely."
: Oh yes.
": Cool so Aurora goes, and surges forward. You also have an object, if you want to grab Gunnie you can grab Gunnie right then and there."
: I grab Gunnie.
: Your legs catch up with you.
: And like drag him behind cover.
": Incredible turn, I cannot fucking believe that."
": Thank you, Rick Perry. Skip, that's gonna be you."
": Skip's trying to get all the way down to kinda near Jan de La Vega, but like basically just like heading out."
": Okay you, if you have movement action and bonus action. So you can go 120, if you want."
: Can I go up like above the D in Baldo?
": Yeah, you can go right up above the D in Baldo and that's just 80 feet. So that's, that's just a bonus action and your movement."
: I think from here can I pop a shot at one of those repo guys?
: Hell yes.
": And I'm gonna do the angle perception on this person. So they have my perception versus their dex, sleight of hand."
: I hit a nat one.
": I had a three on the die, so plus five, so."
": But you are gonna, I think it gives you advantage, right, or no?"
": If you've got a nat one, I don't think it gives me advantage."
": I'm gonna say you roll with advantage here 'cause you're flanking, they hit a nat one, and you're firing from a tremendous height. What's the range on your weapon though? Are you able to, are they within range?"
": My light pistol? 40, 160."
: These guys are probably gonna be more than 40 feet away from you.
": Okay yeah, I think-"
": So that just means your, that means your advantage and disadvantage cancel out."
": Okay, cool so I will just take a shot."
": Yeah, take a shot at one."
: Nat one.
: You fire at one of them who dodges out of the way.
: Shoot like a water pipe.
": Yeah, Sid, you are galloping towards the ramp. You have one hit point left."
": Oh, why did I forget to worry?"
": Not close to you but you turn back around to look all the Jib-Jobbers, 25K credits, there's Barry, there's Margaret. No one's dropped, all these people coming after you, but you see even Jan De La Vega, who's the most dangerous person here. She looks at you with a bit of a rueful smile, kind of looking at her unconscious gunner, but it's not quite over. In the middle of the dock three figures descend wearing pink battle armor."
": Technically I see things in gray scale, but I understand the nuances now."
": Visor raises your face, looks at you hundreds of feet down the course, and says, ""Heard you were talking shit, sugar."""
: You started it.
": Oh we did, and we'll finish it too. Your whole thing seems kind of first thought."
: Well yours feels like A to Z when it should have been A to C.
": Calling me A-Z, motherfucker!"
": Roller blades tearing down, these roller blades are so fast."
: I fucking hate how much I fucking love them.
: Three Warfare Whitneys touch down in the middle of the course and are gonna move down the track 150 feet.
": I mean, there's a lot of difficult terrain here though right?"
: Actually that's true.
: This is some rocky difficult terrain.
: The third beat of your Harold was a little bit crazy town.
: You gotta take the local.
"Br: You know what? Everyone else has been managing to fly and hover, we can cut that one 50 and half due to difficult terrain. So they'll move down 75. So we'll end with the Warfare Whitneys, Talespire, we'll end with the Warfare Whitneys right here. They overtake the Repo Reapers, but are coming down."
: They're fucking gorgeous.
: Look at those freaking guns.
: Oh they're perfect.
: That's gonna be a Princeps Zortch who once again-
Zac: I've kept on top of a building.
"Br: Yes. Princeps Zortch is gonna hit De La Vega. De La Vega's gonna roll another save. Okay, De La Vega makes the save. Riva, that's gonna be you."
Siobhan: Okay I'm gonna psychically throw our boy Gunnie as far into the ship as I can.
"L: Great later, actually can I stay, can you not throw me?"
S: Oh yeah.
L: Don't throw me.
: Great.
L: I can run this time.
"Siobhan: Great in which case, can I psychically throw Jan De La Vega? And I would like to use heightened power to give her disadvantage on her strength saving throw."
Br: Hell yes.
S: Like off into space.
Br: You got it.
S: I would like to try to
throw her off into space.
: Here we go.
: Sorry if I kill your big bad.
": No, no, no. We're totally fine."
: Let it be known Jan I really tried the fucking diplomatic option with you.
"Br: Okay she's got a plus five, but she's rolling disadvantage. This, because you're gonna try to throw her off the Rec Station, this is fully going to be Box of Doom. So we're gonna Box of Doom this, we just, she just needs a nine on the lower one of these dice, nat 20 and a seven. So Riva, you look down in the bulb. Jan's right underneath you, what do you do as you look at Jan?"
"S: I just say,"
Riva: I feel that was really uncalled for.
S: And I throw her off.
"Br: You see that she is lifted up in the air, tossed off the edge, you see she says,"
"if you ever want a real job just holler,"
and hits a little safety bubble on her combat wheelchair and just begins to kind of gyro and Glinda off into the lower tiers of the Rec Station.
": Isn't that the way this world works, you need to best someone in battle to get a job offer."
: Right?!
"Br: You see, she looks out and says,"
My email address is Jan164 at--
"Sidney: Okay sure, sure, Handy Annie, write that down."
"S: And then I'm actually gonna use my movement to get back into the ship. So I'm ready, and also it doubles the range of my spells."
"Br: Yes, absolutely, so Riva you move off the map. That is our first crew member on board the Wurst. Hell yes."
: I am so hopefully coming to join you.
Br: That's gonna be the Jib-Jobbers.
: Jib-Jobbers!
: Let's go Jib-Jobbers.
: They're gone.
Br: The Jib-Jobbers are gonna move another 60 down the track. They're gonna get all the way to this sort of shattered taxi here.
": Come on, Jib-Jobbers."
": Come on, Jib-Jobbers."
": There's just no way, there's just no way."
: We have to.
: It's gonna take them three rounds.
": They're screenwriters, assistants..."
: Incredible.
: Could have the next Spielberg amongst them.
: And you guys see Raymond Zam is gonna use a tech power. Raymond Zam launches something from the rifle and just behind the Jib-Jobbers hits the open dock with an oil slick tech power.
": I look to Raymond and say, thank you so much. I cannot wait to see that muck up the roller blades."
": You see, he takes a little like laminated ring binder and says it's all in the hot exit. Okay, Margaret, it's gonna be you."
": Great I, I don't move right? 'Cause we're moving with this thing on his turn?"
": Yes, you're gonna move with that on Barry's turn, so it's action or bonus action from you, as you're mounted."
": Fabulous I would love to, is it an action to reload his power cell?"
": Yes, it is."
": Okay, cool, I'm gonna do that."
: I hand you the gun.
: Load it up.
: I reload that and then as a bonus action retrain my critical analysis on Barry so another plus five.
": Oh, 'preciate you."
": Hell yes, amazing, Margaret. The brigade you got total cover, none of them could hit you, so gang-"
": Oh fuck, I'm sorry. I, it, they have to have a long rest before I can target them again, so."
": Oh copy that, no worries."
: So I am gonna instead target the Skipper.
": Yeah Skipper's right near you, you got a plus five to a roll coming up."
": Oh wow so I have a plus four from the Princeps' thing, and then a plus five?"
: Well plus a d4 from the Princeps and a flat plus five.
: A flat?
: Yeah.
": Amazing, you see the screen behind you as you're going, it gets hit with lasers. Half the brigade is gonna take a full double move and another half gonna take a single move as they rush after, but they're a million miles away from everybody. That's the brigade's action. Repo Reapers are gonna take a full 30 foot of movement and what is their range like? Gunnie is so far down the fucking track from them."
: I think Gunnie's behind cover with me.
": Yeah they're gonna try to surge ahead. But even from there, it's long range and so they have disadvantage. You have a plus five to your armor class and they're all rolling with disadvantage."
: Is that still up?
": Yeah, and did you, did you cast shield?"
: I cast shield when Needles attacked me.
: Then you still have it. So your effective AC right now is 25 and they're all rolling with disadvantage.
": It's just 20, oh from the cover."
": And you have cover too so your AC, your effective AC is 25. They are all rolling with disadvantage. So they need to hit eighteens or higher on both of these die, but they're making six attacks. Oh wait, no, this was sorry. This will all be against Sid because they're not gonna attack you 'cause they're trying to get your body."
": Okay, then I also shield."
": Okay so same thing, that's all 25 same AC, all misses. These Repo Reapers are, are a football field away trying to take shots, and you're behind the gate."
(laser beams firing)
"Yeah. 25 AC and all disadvantaged shots, there's no way. Incredible, UFTP agents, what are they doing here? They're jumping out and they're, they're gonna take shots at Margaret Encino, Margaret."
: Disadvantage because she's being guarded.
": Margaret, gave me a perception check."
": That's great, dirty 20."
": Okay, none of them successfully can hide on you unless they roll, they would need to roll very, very well, one second, no, none of them make the roll. None of them get hiding on you. None of them gets sneak attack on you. You're not within five feet of an ally. So there's nothing they can really do here. They're gonna all roll with disadvantage. Yeah, miss, this disadvantage is huge. Miss, miss... that one's gonna be a hit. You take four points of damage. This is the first time you've ever been injured in combat."
": Ow, ow, I'm gonna not do it so that we can keep playing, but just know I'm screaming the rest of the episode."
": All firing with their pistols, that's UFTP, Gunnie, that's gonna be you."
": Great, I look over at Sid, Sid, you gonna try and get these Jib-Jobbers in, or are we getting on this ship?"
: I have one hit point I'm getting on the ship. But I'm gonna make a little hologram to try and distract...
: Do you want more hit points? That's my question.
": Yes, please."
": And if I gave you more hit points, would you help us get up just a few more credits with the Jib-Jobbers."
": Reluctantly, yes."
": Okay, I'm gonna do some quick repairs on Sid, oh, that's for a total of eight hit points I could do more, and then I'm gonna head in."
": Hell yes, you head in on the ship NavCom, you want to do a bonus action astrogation?"
: Yes. Is Handy Annie coming with me or you need him?
": No, I don't use--"
: So it's still a straight roll though 'cause it's still disadvantaged 'cause the ship's computer is so bad.
: That's gonna be a 22.
": A 22, you complete three equations, you have five of the necessary 10. Rec Pol are just gonna take double moves to get down. They're not gonna fire, they're just gonna run after you guys. Barry, that's you."
"Murph: Okay, sweet, I think it is 180 feet for us to be able to get onto the ship."
: Yes.
": I would like to 100 feet on the scooter, ride it down. I have the brawny feat, so my carrying capacity is more and also Margaret hasn't really used her movement. Can we both dash and then also I have a bonus action where I can jump 30 feet, and so I want to like take Margaret. Do you want to jump, big jump?"
: Ow!
": Sorry, sorry."
"Br: Incredible, you go a hundred feet move, dash action, bonus action, leap."
": This looks insane, I take the bike, I roll it over some difficult terrain."
: We roll and run for a bit and then I-
": And then you Hulk leap up the ramp. Margaret and Barry are aboard the Wurst. Four of our crew members are aboard the Wurst, incredible. That is Barry, Needles is unconscious. Jan De La Vega is sort of Glinda bubbling down the tiers of the Rec Station."
: Can you wrap me in an emergency blanket?
: Space blanket.
": Can I like keep the momentum going, get Margaret on and just use like five feet of movement to stay right outside?"
": Yes, you can."
: And like be there with Sid.
": Yes, you can get, you can get a three quarters cover behind the things of the gate to like, hold it down out there basically. Incredible, putty mongers continue to flee one through nine on the d20 is bad. It's a 10."
: Oh.
": Okay. That is gonna be Skip, Sid, and Aurora Nebbins."
": I think Skip wants to fly the 150 to the, to the entrance or, you know, the, the, the dock area where everyone is and deposit the Princeps there."
: Yeah.
": And just like, I guess I'm like just shy of being able to get on, I think."
": Yeah, yeah for sure."
: Let's see if it looks right.
Brennan: 120 gets you right here pretty much.
Z: 120 okay. I'm gonna drop Princeps right there.
"Br: Cool, you drop the Princeps right at 120."
: Maybe they're super strong and they can carry you on.
: Carry me!
": Incredible, yeah. You dropped the Princeps and the Princeps goes,"
: I'll always remember you.
: Carry me.
: Oh.
": Pick me up, put me on the ship."
Br: You see the Princeps picks you up.
Z: I jump into the Princeps' arms like-
"Br: The Princeps looks confused and then sprints aboard the ship, Princeps and Skip are aboard the ship. Everyone is aboard the ship except for our two gunners Aurora Nebbins and the Jib-Jobbers, on the dock, like on the ramp all of the technicians have like made their way back onto the ship, and it's you two, Aurora Nebbins, and Raymond Zam all here, looking at the running Jib- Jobbers."
: So the three gunners.
": Honestly, the three gunners, exactly."
: Gunners got this.
": Sid, what are you doing?"
: I really fricking hate this. I want to fucking bring Aurora aboard the ship and get out of here but I told Gunnie I was gonna try and-
: Just yell at them.
: Fucking Jib-Jobbers.
: Give them the help action and fucking walk onto the ship.
"E: No, this is what I'm gonna do. This is what I'm gonna do. You said that there's like a krystalline shit in Aurora. So I could cast enhance android on her right?"
Br: I'll allow it.
"E: I'm going to double her carrying capacity by casting server motor. I'm gonna fucking hop in the ship. I'm gonna point out those bad Warfare Whitneys try and use her bonus action to get her with, to get her to go 50 feet and then have her hold her action for the Jib-Jobbers to hop on."
: Aurora Nebbins can get all
the way to the Jib-Jobbers
and ready an action.
"And you see one of the people says,"
"oh, okay, transpo's coming."
: I guess I wasn't kidding when I said we got a shuttle.
"Br: Amazing, Aurora readies an action."
E: Then I hop on the ship because I have not enough hit points.
Br: That is exactly what you need to do because those Warfare Whitneys have those chain guns and they would have absolutely lit you up as it is you duck onto into the ship. So they're gonna take full movement. So the Warfare Whitneys are going to take full movement.
: Over the oil slick.
: Over the oil slick. So we're gonna look up oil slick.
: Roller blades and oil slicks.
: If I lose Aurora in this I will wipe Jib-Job from this fucking ship.
: It's not gonna happen.
: It's not gonna happen.
: Don't worry about it.
"Br: Okay I'm gonna say that the incredible Warfare Whitneys are gonna roll their dex saves with disadvantage because oil, because it's, it's so uniquely like an oil slick is exactly what this would be. Their dex save is quite high,"
"WW: Hey sugar, where you going? We just want to talk."
"Sid: You know, I can do anything, including be a fucking coward, peace."
: I can't read if he's being sadistic or if he's happy for us.
"Br: You hear,"
": Hey sister, it's nothing personal, you just don't publish a rough draft–"
"Br: Oop, bam! All three laid flat out in the oil slick on their lower dice did not roll over a five. The Warfare Whitneys go down. Zortch is aboard the ship. Riva, any action from you aboard the ship?"
"Siobhan: How big is, I really want that scooter. Can I psychic throw this scooter into the ship? How big is the scooter?"
": Use your primary psychic casting ability modifier, and just give me, give me a roll plus proficiency, so it's almost like an athletics check."
": That's 17 plus six, which is 23."
": This thing got left off in the middle of going full speed, so all you don't have to lift it. You just have to nudge it and it flies aboard the ship. do give me a dexterity saving throw."
: Me?
: Yeah.
: Personally?
": Yeah, roll it."
": That's a nine, it's a hot nine."
": Okay the ship, the ship takes 18 divided, the ship takes one hull damage as the scooter-"
(scooter thuds)
: I'll take it.
: Gunnie's just like in the engineering room doing calculations and just hears-
(scooter thudding)
: Sorry!
": And it's eight damage to the scooter, scooter is damaged, still functional. As it crashes board the ship, that is Riva's turn. Jib-Job employees."
": Oh my god, get on there."
: The stakes have never been higher.
"Br: The Jib-Job employees. With its Borinyum enhancement Aurora Nebbins kneels down board this royal blue mastiff, it is choked with people being occasionally stabbed by the horrifying spines of this space dog."
: Do some of them take out Kindles to read during the commute?
": During the commute, all these commuters get on board."
: They're all reading The Body Keeps the Score.
"Br: Margaret, you're on board the ship, anything you're doing when you get on board the ship?"
A: Help action to Gunnie.
": Help action to Gunnie, do you have any critical analysis left or no?"
: Yeah.
": That would also help, 'cause he's already getting advantage from Handy Annie."
"A: Oh then never mind, yeah critical analysis on Gunnie."
": D4 here, incredible."
"A: It moved from you, Skip."
"Br: Brigade's running, repo does double move down the track. United Free Trade Planets takes double moves down the track. We go back to the top of the order : Gunnie that's you."
"L: Great… that's a nine plus seven, 16."
: Let me see here.
"L: With the five? Oh wait, sorry. It's not a d4, right? It's just a flat plus five. What's the flat plus five?"
: 21.
"Br: 21\. You have completed eight of the necessary 10 faster than light equations. Rec Pol move. Barry, that's you."
"Murph: Sweet, only people still out here are who?"
"Brennan: Just the Jib-Jobbers, that's it and they also they've moved another 50 feet with that readied action. On Sid's turn, everyone's gonna be aboard the ship."
"Murph: Sweet, I can do it right now 'cause I'm gonna use the formation style on Aurora Nebbins. So I'm gonna run out and use the formation thing so that they move with me as a bonus action, and then I'm gonna run towards the ship."
Br: I'm gonna say what's what's your movement again?
"Murph: So my movement, I'm gonna take a dash and then they're allowed to use as much movement as they have."
"Br: Incredible. I'm gonna say Aurora Nebbins grabs you in her jaws. Barry, you're like get on the ship. Aurora grabs you, full of Jib-Job workers, and leaps aboard the ship. All of the Jib-Jobbers are aboard the ship on Barry's turn."
: What happens with the putty?
"Br: On a one through 11, it's not good. Sid, that is your turn."
E: Can I do something to try to get us into hyper speed?
": She can use the AstroNav computer, just the straight up regular one."
": Oh yeah, you could. You could try to use the ship's computer. You only got, you only get a plus one to the roll doing it that way, but go for it."
: Let's do it!
: Might as well. I've got nothing else to do.
: It's your turn.
: 11.
: You complete one equation.
: We need one more.
: You'll need one more.
: Is it my turn?
": Unfortunately, you can't have two people use the computer in the same turn."
: Oh but you could like get us away from the door.
": Oh yeah, I'm gonna like, just like, like go up to the pilot, you know, just like get us away."
"Br: Yeah you jump in the pilot, you hit a button on the side and close the ramp behind you. The ramp goes up. You see all the Warfare Whitneys all of the Repo Reapers, everybody looking at the closing ramp goes, open fire. And they all just start firing on your ship, incredible. And the Warfare Whitneys are all going to go."
": They're awful, they like think that they're the best."
: 23 plus 12.
: Get into this.
": And it's weird 'cause it's actually like really effective, that kind of confidence."
": 45 51, 51 plus 18, 69."
: Nice!
": 69, however, ground to ship is not a direct translation. It's 1/10th damage. Your shields take six points of shield damage. They start hitting your ship's shields. Riva, any actions from you aboard the ship?"
: You can boost the shields?
": Yeah, I'll boost the shields."
": Hell yeah, give me a boost shields check."
: 14 plus whatever it is.
: Strength.
: Strength.
: Plus five so 19.
: A 19? The shields are boosted. You get some temp hit points as your sustaining fire from all of these enemy factions.
: How many do we get?
"Br: Sorry, we'll roll it. Eight temporary shield points."
: Nice.
": Jib-Jobbers rush to the break room, Margaret."
: Critical analysis on the captain.
: On the Skip.
": Yeah, 'cause he never used it so if he wants to use the computer or whatever."
": Gunnie, that is you."
: You got this.
: Everyone's on?
: Yes.
": That's a 12, which I think is one."
"Br: A single completed equation. (all cheering) Tachyon drive engaged, faster than light. As you are pulling away, your shield's taking damage, there are dozens of enemies. Amercadian Space Brigaders, United Free Trade Planets agents, Rec Pol, Warfare Whitneys, Repo Reapers are all opening on the ship. Skip, you get in the seat."
": Awesome, let's ram it."
"Br: Gunnie, you punch in the last equation. Faster than light, where are you going?"
"L: Uh, away?"
"Br: You just pick ""away."" Before you leave the Rec's comms stations Margaret, you get ping on your phone with all of that new money unfold at the end, but please read that off. You get pinged on your Smash 'n Grab app."
": Oh, okay."
Br: And you see that there is a review.
": Let it be a lesson to the enterprising Smash 'n Grab employer that looks can be deceiving and manners even more so, despite their rough and ready exterior overactive appetites and the neuroses read-"
Br: Krystaloses.`
": Krystaloses of the crew's hard drinking Android, the proldiers of the Wurst proved the irony of the-"
Br: Nom de guerre.
": Nom de guerre, and how! Given a scant few marbecs to make good on our crooked caper,the captivating crew took my simple request, humiliate my rival by killing her dog and instead delivered poetry. They stole the dog which ate the rival and then killed a completely unrelated dog for reasons unclear to me, that is what I call service, and that is what I call professionalism, and that is how you get five stars and a 20% tip. For anyone bemoaning the scarcity of good proldiers, rest easy, the Wurst is yet to come."
: Unfold it right there.
A: Five stars and a 5k tip.
"Br: That's all for this episode of Dimension 20, tune in next week and catch the Wurst out amongst the stars."

"Gunnie: Hey Riva, can you come down and check in? Can you check in with the mind of Gnosis just to make sure that they're feeling comfortable in the new space?"
"R: Yeah, absolutely, I can do that from here."
"G: Okay, fantastic, thank you!"
"Br: You feel an intelligence unlike any you've ever felt, and here you see Gnosis smash through a number of like firewalls and protections in like galactic information servers. SQ goes,"
"SQ: (gasps) this way you can live forever, you can keep going. There's no end to the universe."
Br: SQ reboots about 800 times and shuts off.
: I just thought there was maybe a way to save it.
: You still can.

"Brennan: Hello one and all, welcome back to another thrilling episode of ""Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey"". I'm your humble dungeon master Brennan Lee Mulligan with me, as always, are our Intrepid Heroes. Say hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"All: Hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"Brennan: Last we left off... Faster than light, tachyon drive engaged, The Wurst barreled out of docking bay 6-942-0 on level seven of the Vale of Tiers, Rec 97, tearing across the stars to destination anywhere. The ship zooms through its own tachyon field faster than the speed of light, barreling down to the outer edges of the galaxy to safety absconding with untold riches, 25.000 credits with a $5.000 tip and a five star review on Smash 'n Grab from Hyacinth Khrome. A stolen royal blue mastiff, Aurora Nebbins. Our saved-"
Ally: That we can ransom back for money.
"Siobhan: No, we killed the owner."
"Lou: No, we murdered 'em, big time murder, big time murder."
"Siobhan: To be fair, the dog-"
Murph: Aurora killed her.
"Siobhan: Aurora killed her, yeah."
"Ally: Aurora killed her owner. Well, yeah, welcome to the ship."
(all laugh softly)
"Brennan: A psychically lifted, both figuratively and literally Rec Pol scooter with a little bit of scuff marks on it, but otherwise not too worse for the wear. And all 10 Jib Job employees."
Ally: Against all odds.
Emily: The most important crit. I love that crit.
Brennan: The most-
"Emily: No, I'm saying I love-"
"Brennan: The most important crit. You tear across the galaxy. Oh yeah, also, along with the Princeps Zortch and Gnosis."
"Siobhan: Ah, yes."
Brennan: A galactic super computer.
Lou: They say you can't have it all.
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: I'll tell you what, the ball might be rolling up hill, but this ship is going straight forward."
Lou: Yes.
(Ally laughs softly)
"Brennan: We are on the bridge of The Wurst with our crew assembled for the first time. Margaret Encino, you are for the first time in your life, on the bridge of your starship as part of its crew, along with your co-owner Norman Takamori. Unclear, question mark, question mark, question mark. But you are all here for the first time up on the bridge together. You have that termination email resting on your phone, but also that five star review. You have made it by the skin of your teeth from the assembled factions of the Amercadian Space Brigade coming after Norman Takamori, who murdered 12 sisters of the cosmic vale. The Rec 97 Rec Pols whose scooter you stole and whose Blue Heaven level you disrupted with your dog theft. The Repo Reapers coming to take your limbs off of your hands. Take your hands off of your hands?"
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: UFTP agents coming after Margaret Encino who got made probably upon the discovery of that brutal hotel room at the Obfusion Arms.
Siobhan: Oops.
Brennan: Jan de la Vega coming to settle a spacer grudge. And three Warfare Whitneys who heard that you've been talking shit.
(all laughing)
"However, you are safe in the warm embrace of FTL travel with a"
"functional tachyon drive. And you are sitting on the biggest bounty that The Wurst has ever had. It is a mere, it is probably less than a minute and a half since you departed from the docking bay at Rec 97, and you all can start to catch your breath."
Lou: What's the most expensive drink we have in the crew quarters?
Brennan: In the crew quarters?
Lou: Yeah.
"Emily: Wait, didn't I take a grand cru to go?"
"Brennan: You did you have a grand cru to go. You did get it to go, grand cru."
Barry: Bust that open.
"Lou: I look and say,"
Gunnie: May we?
Margaret: Yes.
Gunnie: Yes!
Margaret: Yes.
Barry Syx: Teeny glasses of champagne for everyone.
Gunnie: This has way less shrapnel in it than normal.
Brennan: A little tiny-
Gunnie: You're running hot right now.
Skip: Okay.
"Brennan: Bubbly gets poured, music, a sound system that the captain never used to turn on comes on. Music is playing."
Margaret: Incredible bass.
Brennan: Incredible bass.
Margaret: Incredible.
"Gunnie: Oh wow, oh, woo!"
Brennan: I guess you guys just start dancing for a while. We have a full dance montage.
"Sidney: Actually wait. Before we all dance, I think I'm gonna, I think it's time. I'm feeling really confident after that battle. And I would like to ask Miss Margaret, but in front of everyone, as a display of confidence,"
(clears throat)
Miss Margaret.
Margaret: Yes.
"Sidney: Ever since I fucked that computer,"
(Ally snickers softly)
I've been doing some-
Margaret: Do you wanna talk in private?
Sidney: No. I think-
"Margaret: No, you want it to be in front of everyone?"
Barry Syx: Just let her keep going.
"Margaret: Definitely, yeah, okay."
"Sidney: Everyone needs to hear this. I've been doing some thinking and I've been thinking about how the fact that there was a helper droid that then awakened the moon. And presumably they had similar programming to me, but were able to go beyond their programming and achieve something great. And so with that in mind, I would like to ask for a promotion. Rather than being a companion droid, I would like to be my own droid."
(Ally gasps softly)
"Margaret: Incredible, yes."
Sidney: I'll take a pay cut if I need to.
(all laughing softly)
Barry Syx: You don't have to say that part.
"Sidney: In fact, I want a pay cut."
"Barry Syx: No, no, no, you don't want a pay cut."
"Sidney: Give me a pay cut, I wanna be my own droid."
"Ally: I think, yeah, this is for, I think Margaret is still more hurt than she's ever been in her whole life. Just like, and it's like a scrape and she's like,"
"Margaret: Actually this is a time to say, I would love to have one-on-ones with everyone in the crew"
(Emily gasps softly)
"so that we can discuss and really get ourselves above board. So, you know, we just had ours right now. And of course you, yeah, you're not a helper droid anymore at all. You're very much a-"
Sidney: I'm just a droid.
Margaret: A full part of the crew.
Emily: I flash a really big smile.
Margaret: Yes.
(players clapping)
Sidney: Also I've decided to rebrand from multipurpose to omni-purpose.
(Ally gasps softly)
Siobahn: Oh.
Murph: All right.
Margaret: Wow.
Gunnie: Sounds cool as hell.
"Barry Syx: I like it, yeah. Very cool."
"Sidney: Also, I don't think any single corporation will make me, so I'm gonna have to make myself."
(Brennan laughs)
Ally: That's very-
Lou: Cool?
Ally: Cool.
Lou: Yeah.
Ally: Yeah.
Sidney: More champagne?
Margaret: Yes.
Gunnie: Sure.
Barry Syx: There's very little left. Dole it out very-
Ally: I put up a little signup sheet on the wall. Just like
"Margaret: Anyone, these will be 10 minute interviews just with everyone. so we can really check in and see what we, what kind of goals we wanna have altogether as a crew on this ship."
Riva: I'm thrilled.
"Siobhan: This is all that Riva wants, is feedback."
(all laughing softly)
Brennan: Is there anyone else up on the bridge with you? Would the Princeps Zortch be up here or anyone else on the ship?
Ally: Yeah.
Lou: I think Zortch is here.
Brennan: Yeah.
Siobhan: They'd love to be.
"Brennan: Yeah, so Zortch is here."
Siobhan: And Gnosis is still on the coffee table.
Brennan: Gnosis is on the coffee downstairs just sort of kicking it. Zortch is up here. Aurora Nebbins is also up here.
Murph: Is Aurora being chill?
Brennan: Gimme an animal handling check with advantage.
(dice roll)
"Emily: Nat 20, again."
(Emily laughs)
Lou: It's meant to be.
Emily: How to do it.
Brennan: You will never roll animal handling again.
(Emily laughing)
(Ally gasps in shock)
"You will never, for Aurora Nebbins, for Aurora Nebbins you will never roll it again 'cause this is crazy. And also, take expertise in animal handling."
(all exclaim)
Ally: Oh my God.
"Barry Syx: This dog freaking loves you, Sid."
Sidney: Maybe I'm gonna be a zookeeper.
Margaret: Yeah.
(Murph exclaims in shock)
Emily: I try to pet the-
(all laughing)
"Barry Syx: The zoo is dangerous, Sid. I don't want you ever going near a zoo. I don't want anyone, now that we're a crew, no one goes near a zoo."
Sidney: I'm sorry.
Riva: What's a zoo?
Barry Syx: Great question. It's a terrible place where Barrys kill Barrys.
Riva: Oh no.
Gunnie: And there are animals-
"Riva: Well, I'm definitely never going."
Gunnie: That are in cages which also isn't great. So there's just not-
"Barry Syx: Yeah, true, which looking back on it, that was another part of it that I didn't like."
Lou: Yeah.
Ally: Yeah (laughs).
Barry: Which is why I left to go get the ice cream.
"Brennan: Aurora Nebbins is curled in, Aurora Nebbins seems to like coil much like a ferret or weasel does, is coiled kind of around Sidney, wherever Sid goes on the ship and-"
"Emily: I whisper,"
Sidney: We gotta get you two pairs of roller skates.
(dog growls)
Ally: Aww.
Siobhan: It's your service hound.
Ally: Aww.
Siobahn: Can I psychically check in with Aurora Nebbins? 'Cause I feel like I can communicate-
Brennan: Yeah.
Siobhan: With anything.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Just to see how they're doing. They had a big day, she had a big day."
"Brennan: Aurora Nebbins, you commune with Aurora Nebbins' mind. And see just a tremendous amount of predatory energy to hunt and kill."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: Specifically, it looks like the main food source for creature is terrapins."
"Siobhan: Oh, fascinating."
Brennan: Sort of soft shell turtles on its home world.
(Emily laughs wheezily)
So it really loves to destroy any kind of turtle adjacent.
Siobhan: Got it.
"Barry Syx: Turtles, huh?"
"Siobhan: So I convey this to Sid specifically and be like,"
"Riva: You know, maybe it's just like a play thing. Like they, if you could get them a toy, like one of those toys that you put peanut butter inside."
Sidney: So get a turtle shell and put peanut butter-
Barry Syx: Like raw meat.
Sidney: Inside it?
Brennan: You see a lot of like exterior fangs begin to make sense. This thing has the kind of wild muscle in its jaw to crack through armor plating.
"Sidney: Miss Margaret, as part of my promotion, can we have a terrapin allowance?"
(Siobhan laughs)
"Margaret: Yeah, let's talk about money, right. We just made a shit ton of money. What should we do with it?"
"Gunnie: So I balance the budget, according to with a $30.000 allowance, according to how we used to do it with the old captain. So we'll be giving or as we would've done it, it'll be 3.400 to recoup your expenses for the mission, with regard to fuel and all those things. Also we would invest in the registration, and the upkeep of the ship, that's coming up in a rigon, that'll be 2.320. And then according to the old split, which is four parts for the ship and then everyone else splits what's left. That will be 16.000 to the ship and the captain. And then a cool 1.350 for everyone else."
Barry Syx: That's the way we did it.
Gunnie: That's the way we used to do it.
"Margaret: That's stupid, no, okay."
"Ally: I look at this, I rebalance everything we get, we split it completely evenly with the ship as one person. So we split it perfectly seven."
Skip: Can I say something?
Margaret: Yeah.
Skip: Okay.
Ally: Great. We love it.
"Barry Syx: I love the dual Skips, the dual Skips."
"Gunnie: That's 3.450 each of us to share and then, that both pays out the captain and the ship."
"Riva: Wait, hang on, this is wrong. I also have 70 credits left over. So everybody else, everybody gets an extra 11 credits on top of that."
"Margaret: No, no you keep you're-"
"Riva: No, no."
"Gunnie: You worked so hard, Riva."
Margaret: You earned that.
Riva: Everybody earned that and we're sharing a money as a crew.
Barry Syx: I am gonna give 250 for the massive fuck up at the casino.
Margaret: Hey.
Barry Syx: That I did.
"Margaret: If this was our one-on-one, this would be the time when I would tell you, don't worry about it. This ship is sitting."
Gunnie: I'm gonna throw up.
Margaret: Pretty.
Gunnie: I'm gonna throw up.
Margaret: Okay.
Barry Syx: All right.
"Ally: And I think I take this time to pull out, I've made individual contracts for everyone. There was a lot of contract talk, okay, during that battle."
"Margaret: And I understand you're weighing your options. So I just, these aren't for you to sign right now. Of course, I want you to send it to your people and have them look over and I give everyone a contract for The Wurst."
Murph: Barry signs it instantly.
Riva: I just have to send this back to my entire planet and have them look at it?
Zac: I hand mine to you.
Emily: I hand mine to Gunnie as well.
"Skip: Oh, Gunnie, can you look at it?"
"Barry Syx: Oh, Gunnie, I've already signed mine, but you can erase it if something fucked up is in there."
"Gunnie: Yeah, I'll read-"
"Riva: You're right, these are my people."
(all laughing softly)
"Gunnie: Yeah, I'll read over everyone's contracts and let you know."
Emily: Let us know if any of them are different from each other.
"Ally: There's a signing bonus. So yeah, if you guys wanna, when you guys sign, just know that some credits will arrive."
Barry Syx: Gunnie.
Gunnie: I don't have lungs. My lungs are just a fan. I don't why I am coughing.
(Brennan laughs)
Zac: Sounds like a hair dryer.
Lou: Yeah (laughs)
(Lou grunts)
(all laughing)
"Brennan: You see the Princeps sort of smiling out at this happy meeting here. Raymond Zam pokes his head in the door and says,"
"Raymond: Hey gang, well managed. That was a pretty hot exit. And you know, clap, clap, clap. I'm glad we all made it out there."
Sideny: I thought you were fantastic.
"Barry Syx: We appreciate you, Raymond."
"Raymond: Hey, you know what, obviously, I've worked with a lot of facilities people and you guys are some of the nicest. So I really appreciate it."
"Riva: That's so nice, thank you."
"Raymond: People are, I know that people just got into work. We're looking for the egg bar and we're not seeing it."
Sidney: So I think that we need to maybe make a contract for the Princeps.
"Gunnie: Yes, it was part of the hot exit. We're sorry about that. We are currently having, this meeting is to help establish and get everything set for you guys."
Riva: Hot exit to hot eggs sit.
Gunnie: And that's what the egg bar is gonna be called.
"Sidney: Yeah, that's what, yeah."
Gunnie: The Hot Eggs Sit.
Sidney: The Hot Eggs Sit.
Skip: Hot Eggs Sit.
Raymond: The hot-
Margaret: Give us a cool 20 minutes.
Sidney: A cool 20 minutes and then it's gonna get hot.
"Brennan: You see Raymond says, he says,"
"Raymond: Well, call me a runny chair because it's time to sit in these eggs, eggs sit."
Barry Syx: Ha!
"Riva: Good job, Raymond."
Ally: Barry.
Raymond: They did good.
Ally: Barry and Raymond are the best pranksters.
Barry Syx: This dude rules.
Zac: Skip goes for his blade.
(all laughing)
"Gunnie: He's cool, he's cool."
"Margaret: He's cool, we didn't like it either, we didn't like it either."
"Sidney: Runny chair wasn't really cursing, I think their-"
Barry: It was hilarious.
"Lou: In this moment, I think Gunnie is starting to have the thought of where did I send us when I logged those coordinates. And can I quietly look down at my data pad and attempt to figure out where we might be headed?"
Brennan: Give me just a straight up D20 roll.
Lou: Okay.
(dice rolls)
It's an 11.
"Brennan: You picked a coordinate in a place, I think that an 11 is so middle of the road. You didn't pick a place that has tons of opportunities because you put the priority on, get us as far away from anything that anyone is paying attention to ever. You think in probably another, you know, marbec or so you'll come out of FTL near, actually, yeah, you do, now that you have a minute, you do your full calculations. You're gonna exit outside of the Martini Nebula, which is really out in the boonies. It's not even necessarily near a shipping lane, but there's just enough infrastructure that you could probably find something. Basically it's been 220 cycles since that part of the world was populated. Back during the Incorporated Elysian Republic, there were certain like, (sighs), for lack of a better word, imperial projects. Where it's like, this will be the new center of this part of our civilization. And sort of like that kind of central planning thing of like, and now everything goes here. And then when the galaxy devolves into chaos in the same way that like on university campuses, it's like, there will be the paths they built, and then like the dirt paths where people actually walk kind of, this is a place that used to be a concrete path built by the Incorporated Elysian Republic that has gone totally defunct now during AnarchEra, because there's not a lot of reason to go there. So there'll be some loose scraps of civilization."
Siobhan: Got it.
Brennan: And almost no power centers.
"Gunnie: We got about a marbec before we come outta FTL, uh-huh. I intentionally dropped us off right in the Martini Nebula, which is a pretty low profile area."
Skip: Word up.
"Sidney: This low profile though, wouldn't other dangerous sorts come here to hide?"
"Gunnie: Maybe, but I don't, I hope not."
Barry Syx: Everyone hates us so.
Gunnie: Yeah.
Barry Syx: The less people were around the better.
"Emily: No, we were pretty dangerous. So if there's other dangerous sorts, I think we can out-dangerous them."
"Siobhan: Speaking of dangerous people, I was thinking about Jan de la Vega and maybe she is just an ally waiting to happen."
Emily: That's what I think too.
"Margaret: I have a drafted email, if you would wanna look at it."
"Ally: And I show, because Jan shouted out her email at the end of the fight."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: That's canon.
Ally: So I do have a drafted email that's like-
"Emily: I actually had Handy Annie write it down, so."
"Ally: Yeah, perfect, yeah. Yeah, so it was like,"
"Margaret: Hey, just reaching out, new management for The Wurst. And I just wanna ask what is a fair price that you think we owe you credits-wise? And-"
"Barry Syx: Well, we, I think we all got. We all got tricked, right?"
Ally: Yeah.
"Riva: Yeah, we all got tricked."
"Ally: Well, yeah, I-"
"Siobhan: And also, those nuns were dead before we got there because it was suspiciously easy to get into the place. Which means that we both got tricked, unless she killed those nuns and we stole."
Murph: Oh yeah. Let's also remember that-
"Siobhan: But the stuff was already- Gone, so she must, like the borynium what's-it."
"Barry Syx: Yeah, that's true. She got tricked apparently, but also I yelled at her a lot on the phone that one time. And also we beat the shit out of her operative who was there."
Riva: And I threw her off a cliff.
Murph: Yes.
Riva: But other than that.
Sidney: Marge.
"Riva: We should be allies because somebody tricked both of us. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?"
"Sidney: Marge, can you go on your Reddit account and look for information or gossip about Jan?"
"Margaret: Yeah, why?"
"Sidney: I mean, just, maybe we would find out what her intentions were. I just feel like I don't know enough about her to know-"
"Ally: My thought was if I send an email, that kind of seems like I'm trying to make things right. We don't have to send her any credits. We just have to like start a conversation and then find out what happened with her. She had all of those crates of-"
Lou: Egg substitute?
Ally: Brain slugs.
Zac: Can I make an insight check to see if I can?
Siobhan: Do you think there were a bunch of brain slugs
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Siobhan: In there or just one?
"Emily: Yeah, because there's the emhatchening."
"Zac: I wanna see if I would like, remember if that was unusual for me to be in that or if they were all in there."
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Zac: I don't know, would that just be an insight?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it. Yeah, give an insight check, yeah."
"Zac: 18 on the die, plus, where is it? 21."
Brennan: You go back. This is interesting 'cause you've been spending a lot of time in the neural pathways of the body craft you're piloting. And this time you're not consulting those memories. You're consulting your memories. You go a little bit deeper. You spent a long in the cold. It's many cycles. And confronting the chamberlain who was the cerebro-slug piloting Melon at the Carbine Kennel Club Dog Show.
Siobhan: Stupid.
(all laughing)
"Brennan: No, it's good actually, it's good."
"Skip: It's good, it's good."
Siobhan: It's really good.
"Brennan: Actually, it's-"
Siobhan: I really like it.
"Brennan: Actually, it's good."
"Siobhan: I love it, it's great, I love it."
(all laughing)
"Brennan: Confronting the chamberlain as you did, re-awoke a lot of things in you and brought it more viscerally to the front. You spent so long in that cold that it's almost like your mind has been coming back online as you've been trying to bring the captain's back online. But you remember maybe it was like as long ago, it was like 40 cycles ago. You remember being on an Amercadian vessel and a prior host body of yours dying of old age. And it was just time for you to make something. And you remember the prior host body you were in was maybe some, it wasn't like a speaking organism. It might have been a pet or it might have been livestock or something like that. Maybe it makes sense with like a food vessel moving with the egg substitute on it. But you remember moving and trying to find a new host body, you know, having the limited sensory apparatus. When you're sort of exposed in your slug form, the only things you can really sense are nearby intelligences. You kind of rely fully on your psychic sensory apparatus to locate intelligences nearby. And suddenly you just remember a moment of extreme heat followed by utter cold."
Zac: So seems like maybe this ship blew up or something and I was just jettisoned in space or something?
"Brennan: Yeah, something like that."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: But I'll put it to you as to the history of what you were doing on that ship and how, and I'll actually put this to you as well. All of you watch Skip go a little bit vacant. And I will ask what's going on internally as you dive back into these memories, 'cause as you dive back into the memories about what happened to you, you also remember the memories of what you were supposed to be doing. You remember the House of Mentaphagia Dynasty, your people. You remember your father, King Prilbus, Chamberlain Drablian, Seneschal Vrong who you believe may have been the other person, the owner of Melon and you know, all these other members of the House of Frangus that were part of your royal retinue."
(Emily laughs wheezily)
Ally: You remember Frangus?
Brennan: What's funny.
Emily: This is the most Brennan thing in the world. You made up a complicated political structure for slug people.
(Ally and Emily laugh)
Siobhan: With the stupidest names I've ever heard.
Brennan: Chamberlain Drablian of the House of Frangus.
Siobhan: Yes.
Brennan: Advisor to King Prilbusof the Mentaphagian Dynasty
"Siobhan: Yes, so you get it?"
Brennan: You get it.
"Siobhan: Yeah, I get it."
Brennan: And he was in a little doggy named Melon.
Siobhan: Yes.
Emily: Yeah (laughs).
Murph: R.I.P
Emily: Your name game is strong this season.
Siobhan: And his owner was essentially Adam Conover.
Brennan: It was basically Adam Conover. Picture Adam Conover was Seneschal Vrong who is also of House Frangus.
"Zac: I think that Skip was, you know, tired of that and was trying to get out of there."
"Brennan: You confront the long slow trip down what was probably an air vent. Before the explosion, before the attack on the ship, you recall feeling other intelligences. And in the moment you had given yourself explanations for why you couldn't invest in them. You had given yourself explanations for why they were not suitable choices. But there were other intelligences on that ship and you continued to crawl down that air duct. And I think now you're realizing you were not ever going to find an intelligence that you found suitable because you-"
Zac: I just wasn't ready.
(somber synth music)
"Brennan: When that cold hit you and you felt yourself losing your sentience to the face of mother void, the sense of relief you felt that maybe the cold would take the weight of your house's heritage and the great mission of the Mentaphagian Dynasty away from you and you would be able to simply be, which is not a luxury that you have ever understood, perhaps until meeting these people."
"Zac: I think Skip looks vacant for a minute and then snaps back and says,"
"Skip: You guys are fun, you know."
(all laughing)
"Barry Syx: You're fun, Skip."
Gunnie: I love that we can just stand in silence with each other for a minute and-
(Brennan laughs)
Gunnie: That was like really nice.
"Riva: Oh yeah, the music went off. Somebody turn the music back on."
Gunnie: Yeah. Oh sorry. This is my white noise. Yeah.
"Margaret: I think maybe in the, you know, in our second act as a crew together, maybe we can all just agree that you maybe seem different."
Skip: I should-
"Riva: Yeah, 'cause he is a brain worm."
"Skip: Well, duh."
"Riva: We all, what?"
Skip: I don't know.
Gunnie: I guessed it was something but I know.
Skip: Did I never say what I was?
"Margaret: No, no, we've all been kind of pretending you were still the captain, but you're not and that's beautiful."
"Sidney: It was something that we wanted you to feel comfortable to tell us, not rather than say, oh, we actually knew."
Skip: Oh really?
"Riva: Right, right, I forgot."
"Skip: You knew, okay, I'm not."
"Riva: Sorry, I'm bad at hiding peoples secrets because we don't have them in my culture."
"Skip: Oh yeah, well-"
Riva: You can tell anybody anything about me as long as it's true.
Skip: Okay.
Margaret: So who?
"Skip: I'm not Norman ""Skip"" Takamori."
(Ally gasps exaggeratedly)
Gunnie: I don't think we have to.
"Margaret: I wasn't sure, it felt, I just wanna cushion, I wanna cushion a little bit. I just wanted to cushion it a little bit."
"Skip: My name doesn't make sense in your words. I, you can call me, Skip, just call me Skip."
Barry Syx: Right on.
"Margaret: Great, okay. Yeah, that's easy."
"Sidney: All right, Skip."
Riva: Skip.
Sidney: Yeah.
Margaret: Skip.
Skip: And like my people they're just like a lot and like I have like a loaded family dynamic.
Margaret: Oh yeah. Definitely get that.
Barry Syx: I know what that's like.
Gunnie: Me too.
Sidney: I actually don't understand that.
"Skip: Oh, well like-"
"Sidney: Oh I'm sorry, I wasn't asking you explain it. I just had to be honest."
"Skip: Oh, okay."
Sidney: Everyone was agreeing and I felt bad lying.
"Skip: It's okay, it's okay."
"Murph: Arguably, you kind of do ‘cause the Whitneys and-"
Ally: Yeah.
Sidney: You mean Warfare Whitneys-
Ally: The person who created you.
Sidney: Are like-
Skip: They're kinda like my Warfare Whitneys.
Sidney: My toxic-
Skip: Yeah
Sidney: Family?
Skip: Yeah.
Riva: I have 10.000 siblings and we get on great.
Skip: I have a lot of siblings too.
"Gunnie: I don't have any siblings, which honestly is hard."
Barry Syx: I used to have-
Margaret: Same.
"Barry Syx: 10 siblings and one, Barry One, who just like, and"
everyone ruled.
Skip: Kinda like mine.
Barry Syx: It was fucking awesome.
Ally: Yeah?
Barry Syx: Yeah.
Lou: Yeah.
Barry Syx: It was awesome. And then Barry Nine-
Margaret: Killed everybody.
Barry Syx: Killed everybody.
Margaret: At the zoo.
Bary Syx: At the zoo.
Gunnie: Yeah.
Barry Syx: Yeah.
Margaret: Did you ever go to the zoo?
Barry Syx: Is that where everything went wrong?
(Brennan chuckles softly)
"Skip: I mean, yeah."
"Margaret: Yeah, oh, whoa, oh, okay."
Barry Syx: What is going on with your family?
(Zac sighs heavily)
"Skip: Just, I'm trying to like, like you see"
Zac: Skip trying to like learn how to use this mouth.
(all laughing)
"Skip: Like they have, they, (blows raspberry) they have goals that are all one goal. And I don't want to do that and they can't necessarily do that until I do that too."
Margaret: (gasps) Cool.
Siobhan: Interesting.
"Barry Syx: So bad goal, do they wanna?"
Margaret: Bad goal or boring goal?
"Zac: I think Skip doesn't even know if it's bad, like doesn't even consider it as bad. It's just, he doesn't he, I just don't wanna do it, not right now."
Barry Syx: Right on.
Margaret: Cool.
Gunnie: I'll tell ya.
Sidney: And that's your right.
"Margaret: Yeah, what do you want?"
"Zac: He looks at the like piloting chair and the like just the stars in front of him and just like,"
Skip: I just wanna do some cool shit.
"Sidney: You already have, I've seen you-"
Margaret: This is perfect. I'm gonna need you to sign the contract immediately.
Gunnie: I didn't have a chance to read it.
"Margaret: You've got this all. So you don't, okay, great. 'cause I, you know, mentally, I wouldn't say this out loud, but I'm like, okay, good. So you don't think I'm coming in to step on your toes, which is good, I can keep doing my thing."
Sidney: Can I ask real quick? So I don't really know how to put this in any way that's not indelicate. What do we have to do to make sure that the guy your inhabiting doesn't come back?
Riva: Oh yeah.
"Barry Syx: Yeah, we like you a lot better."
Sidney: Yeah.
Margaret: Yeah. It's true.
Skip: I've delved in there.
Sidney: You're a better pilot in that body.
"Skip: He's tough, he's a tough guy. Rough guy."
Margaret: Yeah.
"Skip: Rough guy, tough guy."
Riva: Mean.
Sidney: Mean.
Riva: Mean.
Sidney: Verbally.
Margaret: I have a question for after this.
Skip: Okay.
"Zac: I think Skip is gonna think about it for a second. I'm wondering if he even knows like, well, other than like, I think I feel securely in control."
Brennan: Yeah.
Zac: Other than like maybe I could.
"Brennan: It's been a couple days. Like you've been in this body for about three malton units and that, like that's sort of the hump for cerebro-slugs. If you can spend a couple days, like a lot of cerebro-slugs will like pretend to be sick or stuff like that. But you know, after a certain point, the reason that cerebro-slugs are even successful as a species is their ability to convincingly be the person. So like you feel a degree of, you feel on multiple fronts, a degree of comfort and proficiency coming to you."
Skip: I think we're good.
"Gunnie: Skip,"
Margaret: Cool
"Gunnie: I ask one thing real quick. I know the answer's probably not what I think it could be, but I just have to ask. Is there like a chance that you're gonna do it to us as well, or is it just like a you thing?"
Skip: I feel like I just did it to like to be able to do it and now I can do it.
"Riva: Great dance, Skip."
Gunnie: I'm all about doing it.
Sidney: That's really good.
Skip: So we're good.
"Margaret: That is good enough for me. I love that, I love that answer."
"Gunnie: I'll take that, I'll take that answer."
"Ally: I hug him for the first time. I'm like,"
"Margaret: This guy, this guy. Now my ear can get close to your ear."
"Sidney: Oh Barry, listen to his-"
Margaret: And you're not gonna ka-ka-ka.
Sidney: Listen to his smile.
(tongue clicks)
(all laughing)
Barry Syx: So loud.
Sidney: It's as loud as it can be.
Gunnie: Not bad right.
Barry Syx: It's so loud.
Riva: That is so loud.
Margaret: Okay.
"Ally: Can I hang up like a big, like essentially like a red string mystery board, but virtual?"
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Ally: So I'm like,"
"Margaret: Okay, so we have something here with like the egg, like, you know, supposedly Skipper killed a bunch of people. We have that going on. We have this Rubian V seed moon thing going on."
"Ally: Can I turn to the Princeps and say,"
"Margaret: One, can you go cook a bunch of eggs real quick, but two, can you come back and then can we talk about-"
"Zortch: Sorry, cook a bunch of eggs?"
Margaret: Can you just run up there cook a bunch of eggs.
Barry Syx: We promised an egg bar.
"Riva: Yeah, like different types of eggs."
"Gunnie: I can sous, you know."
"Riva: Wait, no, I mean-"
Gunnie: Do you need help?
"Sidney: Yeah. Oh, sous chef."
Gunnie: Yeah.
Margaret: He's gonna sous.
"Gunnie: I'm not gonna sue them. Sous chef, it's a-"
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Can we, okay, I would like a group persuasion check."
"Margaret: We'll come up with you. It'll be like we're all hanging out, but you're making the good food that we can can't make."
Barry Syx: You use shorthand for sous chef but you don't know what utensils are?
Siobhan: I got a 25.
Ally: 25.
Lou: I mean-
"Brennan: 25, was that 25?"
Siobhan: 25.
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: Do I have to roll one or can I just give advantage to someone?
Zac: Four.
Lou: 19.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: 19, yeah."
(Ally exclaims)
Emily: 18.
Murph: Nat 20.
(all laughing)
"Brennan: So you all, as you turn and Margaret, Margaret leads the charge and you see the Princeps goes,"
"Zortch: Wait, so what do you want me all to do?"
Skip: Hot eggs.
"Gunnie: It's all good, I'm gonna sous."
"Zortch: Eggs, okay."
"Margaret: Gonna sous, we're all gonna go up together and while you cook eggs I wanna talk to you about your moon."
"Zortch: Yeah, moon, okay. But you need me to cook eggs for?"
"Margaret: We need only you to cook eggs, but we all kind of take a seat and talk."
"Sidney: It's kind of like, it looks like it was quite a burden to"
have this royal family on your shoulders. And like maybe you wanna do something like fun and like a little more of the people.
"Zortch: Awesome, yeah. I'll cook eggs, I'll cook eggs."
Gunnie: Should we just move this whole conversation to the egg bar?
Margaret: We definitely should.
"Brennan: We smash cut to the kitchen where the Princeps of an entire moon of a home world of people who's bonded to save the supercomputer made of their planet's core is going like,"
"Zortch: Okay, I guess."
Skip: And they gotta sit in there. The eggs gotta sit in there.
"Zortch: Sit in there, gotcha, okay."
"Brennan: And you see they go to work. They take the powdered imitation egg substitute. And you see they do something where they add some butter to it and they get like a steam table going. They mix it in with just a little bit of cream, a little bit of cheese, they get some other stuff. It's like this extremely whipped fluffy thing. They work some magic with these eggs."
Ally: We love them so much.
"Brennan: Yeah, they look up and they say,"
"Zortch: Is this good? Maybe I do just like, I can just do some strawberries as a garnish or on the side, fruit, little fruit thing."
Margaret: Definitely.
Zortch: OJ?
Margaret: Yes.
Zortch: Okay.
Sidney: I love this all.
Brennan: The Princeps heads in the back to supplies. You're all in the kitchen and continuing your conversation runner.
Barry Syx: Was there any plan with the supercomputer or was it just to escape and talk to Lucienne and then you were kind of tricked there?
"Zortch: Lucienne had a plan she was gonna tell me about it, but she didn't wanna do it over intergalactic communication."
Sidney: What is it about separating this from the rest of the moon that you think makes it safer?
"Zortch: Well, it's not that I think it's safer. It's just that I couldn't, if I didn't create the holofract, there was a possibility that we would, you know, that like my parent could do something to the moon while that was happening and-"
Ally: I recline a little bit more while you're talking.
Zac: I'm just holding a plate.
Brennan: Just you get served outta there.
(Brennan and Emily laugh)
"You see. Yeah, they look at you and just basically go,"
"Zortch: There was a, bringing the holofract would do two things. Number one while I have the holofract. Yes, there is a latent kind of server existing in the planet. If Rubian V were to be destroyed, the holofract would die with it. But the consciousness of Gnosis is not accessible through Rubian V any longer, not while the holofract is here. So in a certain sense, I was taking away the ability for Gnosis to be interfaced with by my parent or by any of the counselors or advisors in the court. I brought it to Lucienne, because Lucienne said that she could help and that there was a way to forego a revolution, but to use the United Free Trade Planets' power in the galaxy to, (sighs), I just didn't really have any options. It was the only person who was talking to me. And Lucienne spoke like she was so honest about the parts of United Free Trade Planet that were not trustworthy. And she said, you know, it's great that you came to me instead of just someone else, because we can back channel this. And she said that we were gonna make a move to ideally spring Gnosis on the galaxy in a way where it couldn't be harnessed anymore. And that's what I wanted. Gnosis is so far beyond a single mortal consciousness that I just, there's just this period of time where it's so dependent on Rubian V. I just thought there was maybe a way to do something to save it to, (sighs)."
Margaret: You still can.
"Sidney: Yeah, I feel like I interfaced with it and I mean, it was an ecstatic communion with something beautiful, in which I shuddered then fell limp and-"
Margaret: Okay.
"Zortch: It feels, it's wild. It really wants you to feel good."
"Margaret: Ecstatic communion with something beautiful, definitely."
"Ally: While they're talking, can I roll? Because I would actually kind of, I would love to believe that maybe Lucienne is actually up to some cool stuff. And being like, we can use back channels, like she's actually, you know what, to me, she seems really hardened and like, oh, I'm bottom line. But actually maybe she's doing her own really cool thing."
Brennan: Give me an insight check.
"Ally: Cool, yeah, she's just doing her own really cool thing. Goddammit, it's a 10."
"Brennan: You, wow. What if Lucienne was doing her own really cool thing?"
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: And it would be so cool to find that out from what you recognize as one of the most gullible people you've ever met in your life.
"Ally: Definitely, definitely. What if though?"
"Barry Syx: You know, we're talking a lot about Lucienne. But we haven't talked about the danger that the Princeps is in truly, because the greatest villain in the galaxy is after them."
Margaret: Who's that?
Barry Syx: Barry Nyne.
Skip: King Prilbus.
Gunnie: Who?
Maragret: Who?
"Barry Syx: Wait, I'm sorry."
Gunnie: You guys both talked at the same time.
"Zac: When I said that it sounded like, hel-ham."
(all laughing softly)
Barry Syx: Barry Nyne.
Sidney: Barry Nine had a hand in this?
"Barry Syx: Barry Nyne, you remember when I was beating the shit out of that guy with the mohawk?"
Gunnie: Yeah.
"Sidney: Yeah, that was really fun."
"Barry Syx: Yeah, that was-"
Sidney: I felt like it was-
Barry Syx: That was a misunderstanding.
Sidney: It was a little off mission but it was-
"Barry Syx: He thought (laughs) it was off totally. I've beaten up two people off the mission so far in the past two days and I just wanna say, sorry for that. But the guy behind me thought I was Barry Nyne and started cracking wise with me. You know how I feel when people crack wise, I don't like it."
Gunnie: Not okay.
Barry Syx: I started cracking my knuckles.
"Riva: No shenanigans, no japes, no tomfoolery."
Skip: I stole his jetpack.
"Barry Syx: You stole lose jetpack and I thought that was awesome. But yeah, he thought I was Barry Nyne."
"Brennan: By the way, you do see on the jetpack, that guy did have his name written on it. And that guy's name, it says Hogg Cobb with two Gs and two Ps, the two Bs."
"Siobhan: A villain, a villain's name."
Emily: Two Gs.
Zac: I wonder if I understand that that is the name?
(all laughing)
"Barry Syx: So Hogg was working with Barry Nyne, and they said, are we gonna do this. And I thought that meant like, are we gonna fight. So I started to fight, but then he tried to shoot the Princeps. So this dude and Barry Nyne wanted to kill."
Zortch: Who's Barry Nyne? I don't even know Barry Nyne.
"Barry Syx: Barry Nyne is the most powerful villain in the galaxy. Wait, imagine if you will, me."
(all laughing)
Margaret: But backwards. The numbers backwards.
Barry Syx: Exactly.
Sidney: Yeah.
Margaret: Can we-
Barry Syx: And so are the morals.
Skip: Flipped.
"Ally: This is a total shot in the dark, but can I check and see if on Smash 'n Grab that Barry was working for that-"
Murph: Barry Nyne is on there?
Ally: And we could try to find that whatever job that was?
Murph: Who hired Barry?
Lou: We find his profile.
Murph: Who hired Barry Nyne?
"Emily: No matter what, if it's on there, I'm gonna minor hologram to look like a bad rating."
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: Give me an investigation check.
Ally: Okay.
Murph: Can I give advantage because my deep knowledge of Barry Nyne?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
"Emily: You know, all the keywords he would use."
"Murph: He loves working with keywords, all the tags."
Ally: Investigation.
Zac: Can I make an investigation check on the jetpack?
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
Ally: 21 investigation.
"Brennan: Cool, you start looking through. You go to Smash 'n Grab and start looking around. You do find. You-"
Ally: Do I find Hogg or do I find Barry?
Brennan: So you don't find Barry Nyne. The Barry Battalion was so well regarded that Barry Nyne could never just put his name out on there.
Murph: Of course.
Brennan: You do find a profile for one Hogg Cobb.
Ally: Stupid.
Zac: I got a 15 on my check.
"Brennan: You start looking at Hogg Cobb's jetpack. You see it's got name written on it, pretty handy stuff. There's a little sticker on the side just for a little personalization for Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland."
Zac: Hmm.
Murph: Is that that the zoo?
Ally: Is that the zoo?
Siobhan: That's the zoo.
Murph: Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland.
Lou: Can I do a tech check-
Ally: What the fuck?
"Siobhan: Who the fuck is that, Uncle Bob?"
Lou: On something?
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Lou: I wanna know if based on what I know technically, if what Lucienne promised Zortch is at all or even possible."
Brennan: You would need to know more about Gnosis to know.
Lou: Got it.
"Sidney: If you ever wanna workon it together, we can."
Gunnie: I'd love too.
Sidney: Yeah.
Gunnie: It feels like I wanna help Zortch do what they was promised to them. And there's gotta be a way.
Margaret: Should we plug it in? Wasn't it low on battery? Plug it into the ship so we can work on it later.
Emily: Was it low on battery?
"Brennan: Yeah, Zortch, it had run out of the ability to sort of access it remotely."
"Gunnie: I think once we get outta FTL, we could plug it in."
Margaret: Cool.
Sidney: Yeah.
Gunnie: Do we think that or you found Hogg Cobb on-
Ally: Yes.
Brennan: You find Hogg Cobb. Hogg Cobb has three and a half stars and-
"Skip: Loser, absolute loser."
Margaret: Loser.
Emily: I'm just gonna minor hologram off the half.
"Margaret: Three stars, pshk."
"Brennan: Three and a half stars, but 474 reviews."
(Emily whistle)
Emily: Go through 'em.
"Ally: Yeah, what was the most, is there a recent one that seems it was from the Princeps showdown?"
Brennan: You go to-
Emily: Or is there a negative one?
"Brennan: You go to filter them by the most recent. About three cycles ago, Hogg Cobb starts accepting way fewer jobs on Smash 'n Grab."
(Emily and Ally exclaims knowingly)
"Three and a half, and about three cycles ago is when the slaughter of the Barry Battalion happened."
"Sidney: Barry, where is Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland?"
Zac: I show Barry the sticker as well.
"Sidney: And would you, I mean-"
Barry Syx: It's a disgusting zoo.
Sidney: Would you ever consider going back there to look for Barry Nyne?
"Barry Syx: I would, it is my life's goal to kill Barry Nyne at the zoo."
Sidney: At the zoo specifically?
"Barry Syx: At the zoo specifically, at that fucking zoo."
Margaret: Yeah.
Riva: And then eat ice cream!
Ally: I write this down in your file under goals.
(Emily and Murph laugh)
Margaret: This is great info.
Barry Syx: Yeah.
"Siobhan: Oh, is there another app that Hogg Cobb could have been using or is Smash 'n Grab the app?"
Murph: Is-
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Oh, well, there's lots of other ways to get jobs."
"Ally: I mean, it just looks like he got full-time employment right."
Emily: That's what I'm guessing.
Barry Syx: Is the zoo behind all of this?
"Brennan: Yeah, what you essentially see is Hogg Cobb starts taking jobs, his ratings also start to go way up after about three cycles ago."
Siobhan: Oh.
Brennan: Like all of his worst ratings come from earlier in his career.
Ally: So he was a shit head and he got picked up by Barry Nyne and now they work huge jobs.
Siobhan: And they're doing fewer bigger jobs.
"Brennan: Fewer, well, the jobs that you see him getting on Smash 'n Grab seem to, again, on that high investigation roll, seem to, they're not penny-ante jobs. He doesn't do jobs that are small as he used to. They're bigger jobs. But what you see about them is that they're short. And your theory about like Barry Nine picked this guy up, it's like, oh, this dude's enough of a shithead that like, now he only has, it's in other words, it's not about money, it's about his calendar, right. The jobs that he's picking up on Smash 'n Grab are the things that he has time to do. That are short, quick side hustles."
Ally: Okay.
Siobhan: Got it.
Emily: Can I use an investigation to Yelp Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland?
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: I gave it a bad review a long time ago.
Emily: Can I use Handy Annie for the help action?
"Brennan: You may, yes, hold on one."
Zac: I'm gonna be looking for some Jib Job stickers.
"Emily: Didn't help, 14."
Zac: I'm gonna try to cover up this thing with the Jib Job sticker.
Ally: Nice.
"Lou: There's probably a ton at the front desk, right?"
(Zac blows out air softly)
Emily: I think we were using them to repair the ship before.
Murph: We have so many stickers.
"Lou: That's right, yes."
"Brennan: Okay, sorry, what's your question?"
"Emily: 14 to investigate, to look for a Yelp for Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland."
"Brennan: Oh, Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland is renowned the galaxy wide. You can find it, it's on one of the Griivarr Worlds, which the Griivarr Worlds were a series of worlds. It's one of the only corporate factions that can hold up against United Free Trade Planets."
Emily: Can I do recent relevance of the reviews to see if there's any change or is it just business as usual?
"Brennan: Seems to be business as usual. Yeah, the Griivarr Worlds are eight planets in the Tevalt, Grubsteak, and Yesteryear Systems on the edge of the Last Frontier. These planets were bought, developed, and are now managed by Brzzt Oomph Burble You can call me BOB Griivarr, under the auspices of Griivarr Enterprises. The basically, that actually is probably in the AnarchEra 220 would not be correct anymore. Bob Griivarr discovered a time capsule from early Terran history about the simple recipe for happiness. Basically uncovered like an ancient Terran tabloid. And it caught like wildfire as the philosophy of living on this series of worlds. And he became a media mogul, a tycoon, and almost like a secular cultural religious figure in a similar way to like Walt Disney."
"Siobhan: Okay, got it."
"Brennan: Of like a beloved, hi, I'm Bob Griivarr. What's interesting about the Griivarr Worlds is the, is again, that it's one of the few places that UFTP doesn't have its thumb on the scale. It is an actual like adversary to United Free Trade Planets."
Murph: Maybe they're warring over this supreme leader?
"Sidney: Yeah, I was gonna say, do you think that there's any chance that Barry Nyne was recruited by UFTP?"
"Ally: Wait Barry's is a whole, I mean, sorry, Bob's is a whole thing?"
"Barry Syx: So that's just one. The zoo is, but one part."
Brennan: Yeah.
Ally: It's a whole empire?
"Brennan: Whole empire, multiple worlds, many planets."
"Ally: And wait, sorry, what's it called?"
Lou: The Griivarr World.
Emily: Griivarr World.
Brennan: The Griivarr Worlds.
Emily: Worlds-suh.
Ally: Oh my God.
"Brennan: I mean like Griivarr Worlds, it's sort of the, you know, out of your leadership summit where you went, people go to UFTP 'cause that's sort of the sharkier of the two. There's like a culture of kindness in the Griivarr Worlds. But again, they are also an intergalactic corporation. So it's sort of like-"
Siobhan: Got it.
Brennan: You know.
"Ally: I mean, I was pretty high up at UFTP. Would I know some shit about Griivarr World?"
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Ally: Like would I know that they're like shrewd trying to take over the world, just like we are, kind of a business or are they nicer?"
"Brennan: Yes, you would know. Give me an insight check."
Ally: Okay.
(dice rolls)
(Ally laughs softly)
Don't look at it.
(Emily laughs)
Zac: What is it?
Siobhan: It's bad.
Ally: It was a nine.
Lou: So.
Ally: It just flung straight and hit-
"Brennan: It's a nine. You, it's hard to say on the scale of UFTP and things like the Griivarr Worlds, to try to characterize these behemoths of power structures that are by their very nature, like oppressive exploitative and terrifying. It's like, how do you characterize something like that? Like there's heinous shit that the Griivarr Worlds do at like the borders of their enterprise. And then UFTP probably has some like corporate, you know, charity matching policy. So it's like, well, we give a bunch of money to the toy drive, you know. So like it's trying to figure out like, okay, what's actually going on here. However, I think even on a nine, you would know that the business models for the Griivarr World, you don't, who knows if there's a good person in charge of any institution in this galaxy. It's a tough galaxy out there. You doubt anyone at the top of the Griivarr chain is actually a decent person. That being said, Griivarr flexes through its media empire. And it takes PR way more seriously than UFTP. UFTP is the kind of company that's like, yeah, we're hollowing out a moon. We're gonna kill everybody on a moon. Griivarr has to, it has this figure of Uncle Bob and the Fantanimaland. So it's not that they don't do heinous shit but they, in a weird way you think they take more care about how they do stuff and would-"
Ally: Like their employees sign like a code of conduct.
"Brennan: Yes, exactly. The ship is getting ready to come out of FTL in a little while, but there's definitely, you at post-battle and post running from Rec 97, you've peered into a lot of stuff. The open truth of Skip's true nature and connection to a family that remains a little bit opaque at the moment. And also this connection to Barry Nine getting a job to come after the Princeps Zortch. And again, looking at Hogg Cobb's Smash 'n Grab, and the fact that his jet has this Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland thing on the outside, you begin to piece something together. Hogg Cobb's employment record and the fact that his ratings start to go up indicate that he got taken under someone's wing around the time that the slaughter of the Barry Battalion occurred. The other unanswered questions at the time being, looking more into Gnosis, which Sid and Gunnie said they wanted to do. And are there any other, and the Princeps Zortch finished making the eggs sit bar. Looks amazing."
Ally: Great.
"Lou: One last thing I wanna posit, just a thought I have. What if Barry Nyne has been hired by the Griivarr Worlds to get the thing so that they can use it against UFTP? I don't know, I mean, it's just something."
Ally: Definitely.
"Emily: Do you know? Can I ask the Princeps,"
Sidney: So sorry to interrupt it looks like you got a good whisk going on. But do you know were Griivarr emissaries ever visiting?
"Zortch: Sure, yeah, we've met with representatives of the Griivarr Worlds, absolutely."
Sidney: Were they looking into opening a park or?
"Zortch: Yeah, well, they came around before. My grandparents-"
Gunnie: You really don't wanna let those sit.
(Emily chuckles softly)
Zortch: My grandparents.
(Emily laughs)
Emily: But it's the eggs sit bar.
(Lou snorts softly)
(all laughing lightly)
Barry Syx: You can go on.
"Zortch: My grandparents were willing to do a lot of things to become the monarchs of Rubian V and depose the old royal house. They, I think reached out to people from the Griivarr Worlds and from UFTP."
(Siobhan exclaims softly)
"They say, my grandparents basically talked about, you know, who could help them take control of the throne of Rubian V. United Free Trade Planets. The Griivarr Worlds talked about helping them, you know, reach out and find allies amongst other corporations so that there could be negotiations."
Gunnie: Can I have peppers for that?
Zortch: Peppers?
Gunnie: Peppers and mushrooms.
Barry Syx: Gunnie.
Zortch: For sure.
Margaret: Gunnie.
Gunnie: They're in the middle of cooking.
"Zortch: You know what, I'm gonna use my psychic powers."
Brennan: And you see.
"Ally: Improv equivalent of, what's the thing you always sing? What's that thing you always sing?"
"Zortch: It's all right, I have psychic powers. So it's good."
(Brennan mimics air whistling)
"Brennan: You see they look and go,"
"Zortch: Essentially the Griivarr Worlds came with a plan to help us find political allies and United Free Trade Planets showed up with guns. And my grandparents said, let's take the guns. And the next time Griivarr representatives came, I mean, we already had these deals with United Free Trade Planets. And they had the station in orbit. They were a very big presence on our home world, but we did have some Griivarr representatives show up. And actually, they had grant money for the Royal Scientists Guild."
Margaret: Okay.
Emily: Hmm.
"Zortch: This was back at the, this was many cycles ago when Gnosis Project was starting up."
"Emily: Oh that would be the PR move, right, to invest in science?"
Murph: Fund it.
Lou: Yeah.
Emily: That's how you clean the money.
Ally: What do you mean?
"Brennan: Zortch seems to be coming into some kind of realization says, I mean, that's sort of what the Griivarr Worlds are all about, is media. And that's sort of how Gnosis started, was communications. The ship is getting ready to come out of FTL."
Emily: Okay.
Gunnie: We should probably get back up to the bridge. Eggs were great by the way.
"Zortch: Oh, I'm so glad."
Margaret: I would love to just go to my office and start working at the computer.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You guys separate. You see that Zortch looks and says,"
"Zortch: Do I, do I keep doing this?"
"Sidney: Yeah, until the Jib Jobs are sated."
"Zortch: Okay, well I saw some stuff for pancakes so we could do some pancakes or...?"
Gunnie: We probably don't wanna do breakfast all day.
(Emily laughs)
"Barry Syx: Well, you're supposed be doing, did we promise three meals, 'cause I feel like it's just-"
Margaret: I think we just promised one meal.
Gunnie: We just promised a chef.
"Margaret: One meal, one meal."
Zortch: I actually found a checklist. It says I'm supposed to make six staff meals?
Skip: Yeah.
Gunnie: Yeah.
"Riva: Oh yes, that us."
Skip: Yeah.
"Gunnie: So you could do like big entree sorts of things with like, you just like kind of just make a whole mess of stuff for everyone. You could do like-"
Maragret: But honestly we really do like a tapas kinda thing once in a while just to mix it up.
"Gunnie: A little bit. Yeah, but you wanna make sure you have-"
Margaret: Small plates.
"Gunnie: A meat, a veg, a meat sub-"
"Zortch: Yeah, got ya."
"Gunnie: And you know, and then I think just a fun option."
Riva: And psychic option for me.
Gunnie: Yes.
"Riva: But just to be, here's an exciting thing. The position of unpaid intern has recently been vacated."
Zortch: Oh.
Riva: So it is available if that will be of interest to you.
"Zortch: Yeah, yeah."
"Emily: I elbow Aurora,"
"Sidney: Get in there, girl"
Brennan: Aurora goes (screeches).
(Emily giggles)
(Brennan screeches)
"Ally: I step in,"
"Margaret: Aurora, I'm so sorry. You will not be our unpaid intern."
"Gunnie: Well, I feel, shouldn't Aurora be the unpaid intern and we can pay Zortch for their chef? I mean, I know I listed as-"
Ally: I shoot you a look that tells you that this person is richer than God.
(all laughing)
Riva: So we don't have to pay them because they're already rich.
"Margaret: I mean, we'll just figure it out, okay."
"Brennan: Incredible, so Zortch says, yeah, intern or paid. How much does a chef get paid?"
"Margaret: We could we, okay, yeah, we could pay you. Can you sign up for a one-on-one? It's outside my office."
Zortch: I'll go sign up for a one-on-one.
"Brennan: Incredible. Margaret, you go to work in your office. You just start working on the ship's thing."
Ally: Perfect.
"Brennan: Are there any other lapsed codes that you guys haven't covered? Did you cover, you covered the registration costs, right?"
"Lou: Yeah. Out of the fee before everyone gets their 3.450. Yeah, we will cover all of our late fees and then also prepay our upkeep for the first time. That's coming up at the end of the 15 days."
Brennan: You are prepaid for the next nargon's upkeep?
"Lou: No, the current nargon we're paying. We have an upkeep due in 15 days. We're paying that one 15 days in advance."
Brennan: Incredible.
Emily: Ooh.
Allu: Yes.
Brennan: So you are 45 malton units away from the next due date?
Lou: Yes.
"Brennan: Amazing. That, we're riding high."
"Lou: Ship's great, it's paid."
"Brennan: Has everyone marked off the receipt of those? 'Cause the credits clear, the data card clears."
"Emily: Oh, okay."
"Murph: 3.400 each, right?"
"Lou: Yeah, it's 3.450 each."
Murph: 3.450.
"Lou: And then I'm gonna have to, then there's just a general fund for the ship. That's also getting 34, a little bit more than 3.450, I believe. So I'll do that math. I think it's, I'll do that math a little bit later, but it's around 3.500 for the ship."
"Ally: Just put 3.500 under the ship just to hold it, if you're keeping track of the ship."
"Emily: Absolutely, yeah."
"Brennan: Awesome, you figure it as though the ship has a fund of 3.500 credits."
"Lou That can go to our next upkeep if we need it, that can go to-"
"Ally: It's perfect. Well, while I work today-"
Lou: Upgrades.
Ally: I'll probably enter us into the U4F.
"Lou: Oh yeah, union deals or anything like that."
Brennan: Hell-
Lou: Dues.
"Brennan: Hell yes. If you wanna send your union application in, you can ask-"
"Ally: Well, I have to pick my new name, so."
"Brennan: Yes, oh."
Ally: I'm gonna kind of do a little shaving of my own head.
"Brennan: I love it. Cool, so you're getting not only a name change ready, but a U4F subscription. Bada-boom bada-bam. So what's gonna happen now, is you guys come out of FTL."
(Brennan mimics propulsion engines)
The Martini Nebula.
(Brennan blows out air)
"Nebula, cradle of stars. Towering over this corner of the galaxy is a swirling yellow, green, and purple storm of star dust, which will birth new stars into the galaxy perhaps eons from this moment. But you see the-"
Ally: It's Mardi Gras.
Brennan: What's that?
Ally: It's Mardi Gras.
"Brennan: It's Mardi Gras, it does-"
"Ally: Yellow, green and purple."
"Brennan: Yeah, yellow, green and purple."
(air whooshes softly)
"And you see the Martini Nebula towering overhead. Gorgeous cosmic wonder. And you come out and immediately on your sensors for The Wurst you ping a nearby what looks like an old Incorporated Elysian Republic spacer platform that seems to have an active Krystals and Things on it, which is basically like a gas station."
Siobhan: Ooh.
"Lou: I mean, we are few, how much fuel did we spend on that?"
Brennan: On that jump? I'm gonna say you clock in two units.
"Gunnie: Okay, we're at 13. So we don't really need a fuel up. But if anyone wants snacks or anything, it might be a good chance."
Emily: I would like to I'm feeling rather suspicious from life. So I would like to kind of do an investigation on this gas station.
Brennan: Actually give me a ship scan. Let's do it ship style. So give me a scan check.
"Emily: Ooh, okay."
Brennan: You can also roll your perception with this advantage if you want to.
"Emily: No, because my perception is plus one and the ships got plus four to scan."
Zac: Awesome.
(dice clatters)
Emily: 14.
"Brennan: 14, you do a scan. This place is like a tumbleweed infested bumpkin. This is Bumpkinville in the Byzon Galaxy. You're like way, way out here. You see there's a sort of little flat platform that looks comically small in relation to, and the nebula is still probably like, you're looking at a nebula that's maybe like a light year away or something. Like a tremendous distance away, but still towers across the galaxy. This thing is large. It's like a swirling, cosmic endless vastness of gas that is going to create new stars. And then there's this tiny little just like steel and plastic and tubes flat platform. And it's got a Krystals and Things on it that has a bunch of fueling docks for starships. You see there's also a Motel Pie and a Worffle Horse."
Murph: Worffle Horse?
Gunnie: I'm hungry.
"Sidney: I mean, that'd be kind of Rude to Princeps."
Margaret: I would love to go to the Worffle Horse.
"Gunnie: I just ate eggs, but I would eat again."
Sidney: Princeps just offered to make pancakes and we told them not to.
Barry Syx: Do we wanna just hang out all day until we're hungry and then go to the Worffle Horse?
Sidney: Okay.
"Gunnie: We could kind of do that. It would just be nice to hang you, know?"
"Sidney: Yeah, yeah."
Riva: I would love to buy a fridge magnet from the gas station. I've never had any money and I'm looking to start a collection of something.
"Skip: I wanna buy new clothes, head to toe."
"Margaret: Yeah, great, let's do that for you. I like this, I like getting to know you a little bit more."
Skip: At the gas station-
Ally: It's all camo Worffle Horse like.
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: So you see there is a Worffle Horse, which in this part of the galaxy is a sort of notable breakfast chain. It's 24 hours. They've got a long flat metal grill in the back and little booth seating. And they serve you like right from the kitchen on a kind of like very clean, but like a little bit greasy from the old dishwasher plate that lands in front of you, perfectly weak cup of coffee. It's just exactly what you need when you need it. And it has the sort of figure, it's like a yellow sign with a purple worffle horse, which is basically just an alien horse with fins instead of hoves and two antenna."
Sidney: Beautiful.
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: So yeah, you guys can go here. There's also a Krystals and Things, which is not gonna have any like full starship equipment, but definitely has personal equipment. Like Krystals and Things will have grenades, it will have a other stuff so."
"Sidney: If you need a fridge magnet, I actually need some grenades. And the last time I was at a Krystals and Things, they were right next to each other."
Riva: Okay.
Sidney: Yeah.
Siobhan: I'm so excited. I'm like going in my drone. Looking around in this shop. Just overwhelmed with the choice of being able to buy things for the first time in my entire life.
"Brennan: Incredible. Krystals and Things has got all kinds of things. All the things you could need. It's effectively, anything in the PHB is like available in this Krystals and Things."
Emily: Wow.
Barry Syx: Wonder if I should buy back a heavy repeater since I lost one gambling? But I think that cost twice as much as I lost it for.
"Sidney: If you lost it, wait, and if it was meant to be, it'll come back to you."
"Gunnie: Barry, I'd also split the cost with you so that you only had to pay what you had."
"Barry Syx: No, that's not fair. I gave up my repeater and I still have two other guns."
"Gunnie: Well, I offered."
Barry Syx: Why would I need three?
(all laughing softly)
"Lou: While everyone starts to, while we like move into this Krystals of Things, with regard to Repo Reapers?"
Brennan: Yes.
Murph: Oh man.
"Lou: How does the payment work there or is it just, is it like, can I send them a stipend and will that keep them off my back or?"
Brennan: The minimums are the same but-
Lou: 16.500? Got it.
"Brennan: 16.500. If you miss a payment, the interest rate on this company, your principle will go up by five times the missed minimum."
"Ally: No, no."
Lou: I'm gonna hop on the site and I'm gonna send him a cool 1500 credits.
Ally: Can I grab his hand?
(Brennan grunts in agreement)
"What are you doing? Okay, can I use my background?"
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: In business and finance to restructure his loan repayment program and try to get a lower monthly payment?
Brennan: Give me a finance check.
Gunnie: Do you know how many loans I have?
Ally: Oh fuck. That was not-
"Emily: God, that roll-"
"Ally: Would I have advantage in this, that's my whole life?"
Lou: Can I give them help action?
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can give the help action here."
(dice rolls)
Ally: Fuck. Okay.
Emily: Okay.
"Ally: Okay, what is it a finance check?"
"Brennan: Yeah, so proficiency plus intelligence."
Emily: You roll the dice like if it hurts to be in your hand.
"Brennan: Or actually expertise plus intelligence, so plus nine."
"Ally: Ooh, 23."
"Brennan: Yeah. You go in to start to restructure the loan. As you do so, they offer a reduction of minimums and give you a mailing address for a leg, organ or arm."
Ally: What do you mean?
"Brennan: Meaning they are happy to refinance the loan, if you send them back some collateral, meaning one of Gunnie's limbs or organs."
Ally: Oh no.
"Gunnie: I've looked into this kind of stuff before, it's pretty tough."
"Ally: Can I send an email out to a person who would still talk to me that's like a real financial advisor? Like, I mean, the, you know, everyone's like so cutthroat and scary in this world, but I still feel like people with a lot of money and power in these kind of CEO positions are able to finesse even stuff that feels impossible to people living a normal day life."
Brennan: Give me a persuasion check.
Ally: Okay.
Lou: Can I do potent aptitude on this?
"Brennan: Potent aptitude, yeah."
Ally: Okay.
(dice clatters)
"Wait, wait, sorry, what's that?"
"Brennan: Oh, no, no, so add a D4 to the first thing you rolled."
Lou: Add D4.
"Ally: Oh, okay, okay, okay."
(dice clatter softly)
18.
"Brennan: 18, you shoot an email out. And just like old business colleague?"
"Ally: Maybe someone that I met on my way to working at UFTP, but that I didn't actually work there with."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Just someone who's doing well for themselves.
"Brennan: Cool, you hit up an old friend with a very polite email. You get a response back a few minutes later, saying, hey Margaret, great to hear from you. I'd be so happy to talk. Do you wanna holo-screen?"
(mellow synth music)
Margaret: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool.
Emily: Does the location need to be on to holo-screen?
Brennan: Yeah.
"Margaret: Yeah, let's holo-screen."
(computer thrills softly)
"Brennan: You see beautiful sort of like vacation planet.This person is sort of purple tropical palm trees in the back, they go"
"Margaret’s friend: Marge, how's it going."
Ally: Oh my God.
Margaret’s friend: Where are you at? Is that a Worffle Horse in the background?
(Ally laughs awkwardly)
"Margaret: Oh yeah, yeah, we stopped."
Ally: And I give like whatever the opposite direction is-
"Brennan: Well, give me a deception check."
"Ally: Okay. Yeah, oh yeah. That is a 22."
"Brennan: Cool. You see them go,"
"Margaret’s friend: Yeah, so what's up? You're interested in a friend getting out of a bad?"
Margaret: Yeah.
Ally: So I give like a quick breakdown of what's going on.
Margaret’s friend: Amazing. And this is Repo Reapers?
Margaret: I think so.
Margaret’s friend: Yeah.
Margaret: To the best of my knowledge.
"Margaret’s friend: Well, I'd be happy to recommend some, I think probably the wisest course of action would be to invest that money, invest whatever savings your friend has so that he can try to get some ROI to come back and have his money basically making money for him to try to hit those minimums. Repo Reaper killed a bunch of people here last week."
Ally: Oh.
Margaret’s friend: So I'm not gonna interact with them.
Gunnie: What did they say?
"Margaret: Nothing, nothing So you're saying Repo Reaper killed a bunch of people-"
Gunnie: What did she say?
"Margaret: And he should actually just take his like extra money. Like, you know, you have money and then you have extra money, and he should just take that extra money and have it make money?"
"Margaret’s friend: Essentially, what I would say is this, if you don't hit those minimums, it's gonna be really bad. And has, oh, so here's an interesting suggestion, right. You could invest. I would try to be very aggressive because you need to get a quick return as fast as possible."
Margaret: Yeah.
"Margaret’s friend: If one of the things that you could do is head to a casino and put it all on black, because what's gonna happen is, you know what I'm saying, if you double and double again to hit that minimum, then they're not gonna kill you. Whereas if you lose all your money, then it's like, oh no, you lost all your money, and it's like, well, they're just gonna kill me, which they were already gonna do anyway, if I didn't gamble it, right."
"Margaret: Oh my gosh, I'm so glad I met you, so."
(all laughing)
Please say hi to-
Margaret’s friend: I will.
Margaret: Yeah.
Margaret’s friend: How's work going? How's UFTP?
"Margaret: It's going great actually, beep."
(all laughing)
"Ally: I hang up, okay."
"Brennan: You're feeling a little bit cold of space right now. You're a very potent businesswoman, but this is, you're not an executive at United Free Trade Planets, you're the co-owner of a hot dog spaceship."
"Ally: Yeah, but I'm also kind of seeing like a light was shined on the bozos I used to interact with, I fucking hate that."
Brennan: Exactly.
"Ally: I fucking hate that. Okay, cool."
"Margaret: Sorry, that was no help at all. And actually just kind of extra scary. I'm really sorry for putting you through that."
"Gunnie: All good, I've been in debt for a really long time."
Margaret: For sure.
"Barry Syx: Gunnie, Gunnie. Listen to me, you've trusted me before and you know you can trust me again."
Gunnie: Yeah.
Barry Syx: They came after you.
Gunnie: Yeah.
Barry Syx: And you know what we invested in?
"Gunnie: No, what's that?"
"Barry Syx: Lasers at their fucking head, right? Let them come."
"Gunnie: Okay, yeah."
Barry Syx: Right.
Skip: Do you wanna get a repeater?
Gunnie: Don't pay them.
"Barry Syx: Do I wanna get a repeater, maybe."
Siobhan: I step outta of this krystal shop covered. My drone body is covered in fridge magnets.
(all laughing)
It's the first time I've ever-
Emily: With different names.
"Siobhan: Yes, just like basically, but they only have like six different types of magnets. And I got like 10 of each of them. All over this drone."
Zac: I'm just wearing a big t-shirt that says Martini Nebula.
(all laughing)
Lou: Really aggressive graphic.
"Ally: And then I turn the Gunnie and I say,"
"Margaret: So we do have to leave immediately. I hate to break it to everyone, I'm so sorry. But location services were on and that person was-"
Barry Syx: Bad?
Margaret: Was so unhelpful that then it circled back around.
Barry Syx: Cool.
Margaret: To being helpful and me realizing that we're being kind of stupid. We should pick a new place.
"Barry Syx: Real quick, I am gonna go in and buy another heavy repeater."
Margaret: Sure.
Brennan: Great.
: I stack up on-
": Oh, I go in too. Let's go in and shop a little."
": Yeah, you're having this conversation about how in trouble you are in the aisles of the Krystals and Things."
: Yes.
: Love it.
": You know, how the-"
": Oh, I'll get some truck nuts for the ship. Oh good idea."
": Yeah. You could, honestly. You go out and Murph, you see that they have heavy repeaters in the hard plastic cell phone casing. So like whereas you get like a (laughs). So it's just enormous. You have to like both arms, take it off of one of those hanging hooks. Walk it out, they scan it at the front. You get a new heavy repeater."
: I'm gonna buy four power cells.
": Hell yes, oh, if you guys wanna load up on power cells, you can, they're are 10 credits of power cell."
": Oh, I'm buying 10."
Emily: I'm gonna load up on power cells.
Murph: I'm good on power cells.
: Grenades and I'll look in the PHB to see if there's any kind of like anything else.
: Cool.
: Can I buy raw materials to make things on the ship?
Emily: Oh.
": You see at the back of the Krystals and Things, you see that they have these chests that are literally 40 credits for a chest. And they are enormous 15 foot by 15 foot by 15 foot crates. And you see it's called space junk. And they have, you look in there, this is not just junk, this is not like raw metal. This is like things that scavengers at the edge of old incorporated Elysian Space find as they go through old defunct battle stations, old star destroyers and things like that and harvest engines, parts, weird old alien tech that people don't know what it does anymore. You look in this and you're like, oh, these bargain bins are like untold, yeah. And they're are 40 credits each."
: Let me get six of those. (Brennan laughing)
: And could I make a grenade from these?
: This is raw materials to make whatever the hell you would wanna make.
": Okay, I'm gonna get some of those too."
": And could I make, and I look at Sid and I look down, a pair of roller skates for my drone?"
: I think I could make those for you. (Siobhan exclaims delightedly)
": Incredible. Cool, you guys walk out with a full cart from Krystals and Things. As you approach The Wurst again, you look out, you see that Princeps Zortch, they come out of the Worffle Horse with a bunch of to-go coffees and just start handing them out to people."
: Yes.
: Appreciate that.
": So the, what I will ask now is, you get a bunch of space junk. The Princeps has meals running for the Jib Job people who all look super happy. Everyone seems very, very into it. You see that even Autumn, the screenwriter over in the corner, is apparently having a call with someone it seems to be going well. There's like something going along. And you notice that the Princeps looks over at Gnosis sitting on the coffee table, but you're also aware that you need to pick where you're going next cause your location's compromised. And the question remains like, you have a lot of half leads. You have a lot of stops and starts, but you are the ones who decide where to go next. And also it's not only about where you wanna go next, but what are you trying to do? Are you trying to get more jobs? Are you trying, the things I'll throw out to help guide your decision making. Are areas with more civilization will have more possibility for you getting spotted, but we'll also have more jobs available to you. Additionally to that, if you wanna stay in a place with a low profile and you feel like you have enough cash at this edge of the galaxy, there are ship nurseries you could go to. There are planets that do have like places that you could mod out a ship. And especially because not in a civilizational center, you're not gonna get top of the line stuff, but you can get good stuff for dirt cheap because the economy out here slows way down, away from all the big Rec Stations and things like that. (mellow elevator music)"
": Could put the max distance on Smash 'n Grab, see what comes up and go mod our ship."
": I mean, I'm never opposed to more mods."
: Yeah.
: Right.
": There's also, it does seem like the Griivarr System has something to do-"
: I was thinking same thing.
: With everything. I'm even wondering-
: I feel like they're not gonna be as military with us because they're trying to put on a good face.
": And also, if UFTP is really mad at us, the Griivarr System won't be. I'm also wondering, you said Lucienne's kind of doing things on the sly seems? Is there any way that she would be working with Griivarr?"
": How does Crown and Scepter, UFTP, Griivarr, are these some of the main players?"
: They're fully isolated from each other.
: Okay.
": Griivarr, so UFTP is fully a subsidiary of Crown and Scepter Limited."
: Got it.
": Crown and Scepter Limited is the top of that pyramid, right."
": And would that be like Griivarr is top of its own pyramid, Crown and Scepter-"
": Yes, Griivarr is top of its, yes, exactly."
: Okay.
": So Lucienne, I think just kind of raised up to the top of that, but maybe."
": I would, I just kind of wanna see Griivarr World a little bit. But I also feel good. I think my only priority would be wherever we go, we make a first order of business to try to plug in Gnosis."
": We can plug Gnosis in on the ship, right?"
": Yeah, but we can't jump and plug in Gnosis at the same time."
: Yeah.
: Oh yes. Jump first.
: Got it.
": You guys all can gimme some investigation checks if you would like, yeah."
: Do they relate to the ship or?
: They're investigation checks about what is available to you if you can't be in faster than light travel right now?
: 25.
: So flat 20.
: Flat 20.
: 14.
": I wanna more about Lucienne, I think."
": Cool, yeah, gimme a roll about Lucienne."
": Oof, that was not good."
: Just a 10 for me.
: I think my investigation is actually about like the most DIY sort of ship nursery.
": Okay, the most DIY ship nursery. And you got 25?"
": 25, Yeah."
: Oh.
": Since we're both thinking about like, we're almost thinking about like hacking this Gnosis thing. It seems like we need to start building up those skills."
": You look around again, you're in the boonies. You're by the Martini Nebula. You're here at a Krystals and Things on the edge of space. There are only a very few places that are travelable without going FTL, right. And on a 25, there is a place nearby here that is a old Amercadian colony world called New Texas. (Emily chuckles softly) New Texas has a lot of friction with Amercadia. The Brigade has some presence there, but it's so far from Amercadia and there's a bizarre, on that investigation check, you note, there's a bizarre cultural difference where all the people on New Texas feel like they love Amercadia. And as a result, they hate Amercadians 'cause they feel Amercadians, don't love Amercadia as much as the people in New Texas love Amercadia. But New Texas is like this wild sort of at the fringes of Amercadian Space. But it's a Brigade outpost, but it's an entire planet. So there's a certain degree of like, if you go to the boonies out there and there's a ton of ship nurseries. It's a sort of a perfect mix and match of little dusty, little rough around the edges, but has the resources to really mod out a ship and they'll be cheap out there."
: Is there anything we can do with our ship to sort of like stealth it? Since we're not going into FTL? Since our location was given away?
": Not going into FTL means you won't have an energy signature presence entering that planet. So if the Brigade has sensors out ready for you to come out of FTL in the corona, or sort of in the atmosphere around that planet, if you just travel there through real space, they won't detect it."
Ally: Let's do it.
: Sounds like a great place to hit.
": Yeah, yeah."
: Plan.
": No roll required. You just are gonna roll up on that planet that doesn't have like a big planetary defense system. And you can just find, you can signal or hail a ship nursery somewhere that feels like within your price range that you're interested in and you can head down there."
: Great.
": So you guys get back aboard The Wurst and take off, beginning to fly through through real space. It'll be three days of travel through real space to get where you're going. So it'll be three fuel units by the time you get there, but there are ship nurseries. And obviously, you know, this is a place where they mod and refit ships. So refueling is not gonna be a problem."
Lou: Cool.
: That makes me feel more comfortable actually. That it's gonna take three days travel.
": As you zip along, you chart a course for New Texas and make your way there. As you do so on the ship, I believe there was a desire to boot up Gnosis."
: Yeah.
: Amazing. Where do you take Gnosis to boot?
: Tachyon drive.
Brennan: Tachyon drive.
: Tachyon drive.
": Hell yeah. You take Gnosis to the reactor core. The NavCom comes on and SQ goes, boo-bloop. Hello, it looks like we're about to engage tachyon drive."
": Yeah, S, but we're gonna do a modified thing. We're not gonna be jumping. We're just, we gotta, we need to juice a physical power source we've got here in this space."
": Copy that. Go ahead and give me a, as you go to boot this up, you have Sidney here. The Princeps Zortch is here as well. What is it that you all attempt to do? You're looking at an organic, you're looking at a self-created organic computer that zip filed its planetary consciousness into an organic gyro polyhedron holofract."
": Well, Zortch seemed to have this idea that the thing could be-"
: Fucked? (Ally chuckles softly)
": I mean, had an idea and a plan of action that they executed, that they would have sex with it. But they also-"
: I did have sex with it.
: And then Sid followed up with that. But it seemed that they had an idea around like the potential of what else could be done with this.
": Yeah, they look at you and basically say like, well, I know it can run off of energy. Like back on Rubian V, it runs off of the gravitational force of the planet that it is, but I mean, producing, you know, a moon produces enough energy just through gravity and its own mass. But this, I don't know, doesn't have like a plug. So I don't know how."
: I think it's probably like one of those cell phone chargers that you just put it on top.
Lou: Yeah.
: Give me a technology check.
: Got it. Can I have advantage or can I have help from?
": Yeah, I actually have proficiency with this."
: All right.
: So can I give him the help action and also my proficiency?
: Hell yeah.
: So.
: So you get to add an extra plus two.
": An extra plus two to the roll, roll with advantage."
: Plus 11.
: Plus 11.
": That's (laughs) come on, don't mess this up. Not today, that's a 17 on the first one, and that's a cocked. (dice clatter) That's an eight on the second one. So we'll go 17 plus 11 for 28. (air whooshes softly)"
: You open up the loading chamber for the plutonium rods that go into the reactor core.
Zac: Good.
": You and actually the borinyum krystal that is truly like the engine of the ship, the sort of ignition catalyst being this plutonium, and then the borinyum krystal, you open it. Hear the sort of sonic vibrations going through the chain of interlocked borinyum krystals that form the heart of the reactor. And in that exterior chamber, sort of putting it to see if the deific super computer can harness that sort of ambient energy. You hear SQ go, oh, reading a very powerful energy signature from the new computer. This new computer seems to be pretty cool. Sort of what's the-"
: SQ don't be jealous.
": I'm not jealous. I'm just, you know, it's like, ugh, there's two computers on the ship, it seems like more computers than the ship needs."
": Hey, SQ, you're the ship's computer. This is just a computer that's visiting."
: Yeah.
: And might stay for a while.
": It's pretty cool in the last FTL jump that we used me at all, (laughs), 'cause often we don't so."
": SQ, this is actually kind of a new artificial intelligence, like self-made and I really wanna make sure that it feels safe and welcome. And I feel like you are so sweet and I feel like you could totally win it over."
": Oh, okay."
": SQ, you could be like a big brother to this new young, a mentor, teach it a thing or two."
": Well, I mean, that'd be nice, well. (all laughing)"
: I make eyes will Sid. I don't think he's helping us.
: Did you fuck him?
: I did not fuck him.
: It's okay if you did. I fucked him too.
": I tried to get pleasure from somebody else and we had to run away. I should email her, I need to email her. I don't know where this is coming from."
: Email someone that you were thinking of fucking.
": Well, I did, no, well, Skip made me do it. He was like, I wanna give, do you want pleasure. You remember that? Anyway, SQ."
Brennan: Yeah?
": Yeah, it's a powerful computer, but we are really glad to have you here and helping us."
: Give me a persuasion roll.
: Can I give a help action?
: You can give a help action. You can roll two D20.
": That's a 10 on the first one, 13. Oh, it was a 14 and then it became a four. So that's a 13 total."
": You see SQ goes, okay, well, you know, I'll keep an open mind. I mean, my mind's not self-created, so I don't know how open I can keep it, but you know, I was designed in a lab, so."
": I was too, I was too."
: It's different. (all laughing)
: Are you sure you didn't fuck him?
: No.
: Never?
": Maybe I should have fucked him. (all laughing) Is that rude, is that rude, should I not have said that?"
: I think you should.
": Cool, you see, the holofract begins to (air whooshes softly) (air rumbles softly) levitate to the center of the lock. The inner shapes begin to (air whooshes softly) rotate, orbit. Zortch goes, (gasps), it's happening. You see a shape begin to coalesce on the lithium surface within the holofract. (air whooshes softly) You see dials begin to go a little wild here. You're just getting powerful energy signatures, powerful readings."
": Can I hit Riva on the comms? And ask, hey Riva, can you come down and check in, can you check in with the mind of Gnosis just to make sure that they're feeling comfortable in the new space."
": Yeah, absolutely, I can do that from here."
": Okay, fantastic, thank you."
": You're welcome, thank you."
: Thank you.
: Thank you.
: Thank you.
: Thank you.
": Hey, thanks, guys, thanks for joining the gunner channel."
": I like that we've made the gunner channel the channel, you know."
: Yes.
: Thank you.
": Oh, we should get the Princeps on the gunner channel."
: Oh yeah.
: Princeps.
": Oh, yeah."
": I know, you're on the cooking channel over here. We're all over on the gunner channel, that's our main channel."
": Okay, I'm gonna switch over to gunner channel."
": Hi, welcome to the thread."
Murph: To the gunner channel.
: There's a lot of people on this channel. So you see that the holofract begins to move around and become aware. The last time you saw this happening was in the hotel room at the Obfusion Arms. It begins to spin a little faster. And you see (air whooshes softly) the reactor begins to boost as though someone had just boosted engines. (propulsion engines rumble)
": SQ, did you just boost the engine?"
": I didn't boost that, I did, I, oh, hoo, wow, wow, wow. It's nice to meet you. I, oh, oh, ga-ga-ga-ga-ga, ho, ho, oh, oh, oh. Oh, my leg, my leg, my leg, my leg. I don't have a leg! You see a row, one of the gunners that you are not occupying just. (gun blasting softly) (all laughing) Fires off into space."
: Can I try and switch power around in the ship to like try and balance out this surge?
: Give me a mechanics kit check.
: Right.
: Trying to beat a DC20.
: That's 25.
: Where do you divert power to? You have to divert it somewhere in the ship. You can divert it to comms. You can divert it back to the reactor. You can divert it-
: Waste management.
: Waste-
: The movie theater. (all laughing softly)
: Is it like-
: You can do the movie theater.
": Where I divert it, is it a problem?"
Emily: It's probably gonna be an explosion.
: You're basically trying to pick a place that you think all this excess power can go.
": Oh, the espresso machine in the Jib Job."
": You go to the Jib Job espresso machine. You see, (blows out air). You see (blows out air) a whole bunch of bags of beans, lift up psychically (blows out air) and begin to pour into the espresso. And it (hisses) lifts up off the deck and begins to blast a stream of (like) Vantablack light absorbing espresso (blows out air) all over the ship. You see that one Jib Job guy goes like, so we're thinking a sort of sleek model (exclaims). Espresso goes-"
: Margaret would you send out an email saying there's free coffee at the Jib Job? (all laughing)
: Definitely.
: Tell them there's free coffee at the Jib Job.
: Okay.
: And the power is kind going in and out in my office.
: Its fine.
: Can you tell me what the fuck is going on?
": Gnosis is fucking SQ, the ship computer right now."
": Okay. Gnosis, you see shatters the back of the plutonium lock to directly raw connect to the reactor core of the ship. They're gonna roll a plus 20 to this roll. You are trying to beat it on a technology check. Here we go, okay. It rolls a 10 trying to beat a 30 on a technology check."
: A 30?
: Can you?
": Okay, but help action from me and proficiency."
": You get a plus 11. On a 19 or 20, you get it done."
: Can I potent-
: Potent aptitude?
: Can I potent aptitude myself?
: I will allow you in this instance to potent aptitude yourself.
": Okay, great."
": Okay, okay, let's do it anyway."
: You can do it.
: All right. I'll roll the D4 for fun. Here we go.
Brennan: It's a one.
: Okay.
": : 18, 19, 20."
: That was fun.
": 18, that was fun, right?"
: This was fun.
": 18, 19, 20. (dice clatter)"
: Nine.
: Nine.
": You jump in, you gotta pick another place on the ship to divert this power to."
: I have one more.
: Do a roll with advantage.
": Oh, oh, oh, you have one more. You're rolling with advantage, here we go."
": I'm slow, I don't know-"
": 18, 19 20."
": If it's because I don't like drama, ah. (dice clatters)"
": Seven, okay. All of that. Pick a place on this ship. Where else is power gonna divert to?"
: This one-
": Another gun, another gun."
: Going to the other gun.
": Barry, you're kicking it on the other gunner station. And you see your gun just full. (gun blasting) (Murph exclaims)"
": I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
": No, it's fine, it's fine."
": I fucked up, no, no, no, no. It's my bad, it's my bad, it's not fine. I fucked up, I fucked up, I'm really sorry everybody."
": Barry, it's not your fault."
": I'm really sorry, it's my bad."
": This is not your fault, Barry!"
: I fucked up again.
": You hear SQ comes over the comms of the ship going, oh God, I'm in love. I think I'm in love, I'm in love. (Emily laughs) And you it's gonna roll again. It rolls in front of the board. It adds 20. That's a three only gotta beat 13. Oh no, you gotta beat 23."
: 23.
: You have to beat a 23.
": Okay, I got one more potent aptitude. I'm gonna use that again. Two this time."
": Two, all right, okay."
: 23.
: Gotta beat a 23.
"Murph: Advantage again, right?"
: Advantage.
": That is a 17, that gets it done. Okay."
: Oh God.
: Great.
": You connect to Gnosis. (air rumbles softly) Every holo, you manage to come down, tamp down on the reactor core. Every screen in the ship comes on with an image of Gnosis as it depicts itself, crackling, bright light. And you see the shapes whirl, and it begins to form a shape. You see, first there is a circle. The circle becomes a spiral. (Brennan sucks in air) The spiral compresses on two sides (Brennan blows out air) until there is almost a spiral that is rounded on top and bottom, but straight the left and right. (air whooshes) You see (blows out air) that gleams brightly on the holo-screens. You tamp down the reactor core. SQ goes, oh, oh, oh, it's real. You can live forever. You can keep going, there's no end to the universe. The Severed Gram, I am the ruler of the Severed Gram. And you see SQ reboots about (air rumbles)"
": This feels like what happened to you maybe in the same, like SQ interacting with it and it shutting-"
": I mean, the things that SQ was saying was like, really, really like I also came. (all laughing) Which I've never done with any of Riva's Pleasure Putty before. I didn't think I was capable of it."
": On that technology check, you see Gnosis, (blows out air) all those holo- screens showing. All the people in the movie theater are like, this movie got weird. (all laughing softly) You see, you see that symbol appear on your data pad, which is the first time that Gnosis has (blows out air) entered this data pad. And you see with that technology check, it stops expanding because you think it has chosen to. It recognizes something. And you see (sucks in air) a message in a language, in maybe like every language ever spoken. (computer thrilling softly) Different alphabets, different symbologies, different hieroglyphs. Go ahead and make a lore check for me."
": Right, this is happening on Gnosis' terms for sure. (dice clatter) Oh, a 24."
: 24 is really good. Hold on one second.
": Riva, you also speak every language, right?"
": Well, technically I transcend language in my communication. So you think that I am speaking your language-"
": Got it, got it."
: But in fact I am just communicating.
: But you can't make a look at it-
: Yes.
": All right. Cool, cool."
: I speak every language.
": Yeah, I was gonna say polyglot."
: Yeah.
: But it also sounds like the message is written in every language.
": In every language at the same time, yeah."
": You decipher it. And I'm gonna say Riva, you can help with some of this, 'cause you can feel this conscious. It feels strange to you. It's as far away as Sid's mind is from an organic mind, this is farther than that. And then vaster by impossible orders of magnitude."
: Right. Is there any way that I can communicate with it as somebody who communicates psychically and communicates in concepts and images and like big picture things that I have to sort of narrow down for humans so that they will understand me?
: Hell yes.
: Is there a way that I can explain to Gnosis this is what you have to do and like sort of the concept of a conceptual intellectual funnel?
": Do you want to make a channel for, do you want to channel Gnosis into your own mind to help Gunnie decipher this message on the data pad?"
": Anything for my friend Gunnie. Absolutely, yes, I will channel Gnosis through my mind. (all laughing softly)"
": Okay, hold on one second."
: Can I give Riva my proficiency as well?
": Yes, go ahead and make a insight check. (dice clatters softly)"
": Oh, so close. It's a plus two with your proficiency?"
Emily: Yeah.
: That's a 15.
: Okay. So.
: He's got graphs over here?
": I know, I know I'm doing something crazy. Don't worry about it."
": I also wanna, while you're doing this, I want the Princeps to summon, to think of the helper, the helper communication droid that started this all."
: Yes.
: And see if that means anything to it.
": Oh, you see, as you say that, you communicate that telepathically to Zortch. Zortch goes, that's right, wait a minute, that's this symbol. And points to that, partially collapsed spiral. Zortch has psychic capabilities, reaches out to you. Is gonna give you advantage on that insight roll. (dice clatters)"
": All right, that's better. That's a 21."
": 21\. Riva, you soothe Gnosis. You feel an intelligence unlike any you've ever felt. The most similar this thing is, is you've never experienced this consciously, but when you rest, you remember on your home world swimming in the dreams of all of the rest of your planet. This feels like that but with a sharp metallic lucidity to something that is very much not at rest."
: Ooh.
": And as you do so, however, you experience Gnosis touches your mind. And in contact with that psychic energy, it feels the feeling of dreaming and of being at rest. You soothe the powerful artificial intelligence. As you do so, I'm gonna give you this to unfold one line at a time, as you slowly, decode the message. You're decoding these symbols as they arrive."
: Right.
: Read it over the gunner channel.
": Yeah, of course, coming in, live over the gunner channel. This is what I'm getting. It looks like you're trying to write a letter."
: Are you a-
: Is this that paperclip?
: You're the fucking paperclip.
: A collapsed spiral.
: Paperclip.
: Goddammit. (all groan)
: You're Clippy?
: Oh my God.
: Is this Clippy?
: You're fired.
": Folks, that's it for ""Dimension 20"". My name is Brennan Lee Mulligan. It's been a great show, take care."
": That's why it's always bouncing, it's cumming."
": Wait, so all these people have been fucking Clippy? (Ally laughs softly)"
": Hey, I don't care who I've fucked if it made me feel like that-"
: you had sex with Clippy?
": Yeah, I fucked Clippy."
: Respect.
: You know what?
: Fucked Clippy.
: You know what? Clippy fucked me. (Lou exclaims) (Emily laughs softly)
: It looks like you're trying to write a letter.
": Okay, wait a second. So this is gonna entirely change how droids interact, because this is essentially a droid consciousness."
": Gnosis begins to show you. (air rumbles softly) The early genesis of the Gnosis Project on Rubian V. Different scientists from the royal court of Zortch's family, interacting with nonprofit sort of grant providers and different orgs from the Griivarr Worlds. You see some representatives from the Griivarr Worlds showing up. The history of the Griivarr Worlds. Bob Griivarr AKA Uncle Bob of Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland was a galactic sheet metal and mine worker in AnarchEra 53, a short 53 cycles after the revolution. And discovered an ancient Terran time capsule containing some relics of the ancient Terran home world, which he used to write ""Bob Griivarr's Simple Recipe for Happiness"", a best selling novel that made him so fabulously wealthy, he was able to buy the first of many worlds in the Griivarr Worlds and start his media empire. The ""Simple Recipe for Happiness"", which includes such ingredients as a generous measure of meaningful work, sweetened with companionship and affection and leavened with familial duty."
: Ew.
": Took that corner of the galaxy by storm. And you see, however, it is possible that that tabloid that contained that simple recipe to happiness from that ancient lost culture was not the only thing in that time capsule. And indeed, those Griivarr envoys bearing funding also brought a piece of ancient technology to serve as the basis of Gnosis."
: So maybe they planted this seed in the moon purposefully. It wasn't just a thing that happened organically.
: Oh and then it's almost like gray goo. It changed the things around it.
: Yeah.
": But these all sound like good things, right? He found a bunch of relics. One had something for happiness. One has this like extremely powerful."
": Zortch looks up and says, well, our scientists made the technology. But the basis of the technology was this piece of ancient Griivarr World tech or this piece of ancient Terran tech, that communications had failed between all of the noble houses of Rubian V. And they had a recommendation for how we could communicate better."
Emily: And it was Clippy?
Lou: Word? (Brennan chuckles softly)
: It was Microsoft Word?
: Microsoft. (Emily laughs wheezily) What? How do you know?
: That helped them excel? (all snicker softly) (Emily laughs)
: There's gotta be a point...
: Barry shoots the guns again. (guns blasting softly)
: There's gotta be some kind of power point.
Ally: Oh no.
: Or a point to the power.
: Oh.
Brennan: You see that-
: Is Bob Griivarr still alive? Sorry to interrupt.
": Bob Griivarr is not still alive. Some of his descendants are, like his kids were, one of his kids was a famous historian. Another one was a famous televangelist. Another one was-"
Emily: Boy.
": Yeah, the Griivarr family is still present."
": Historian and an evangelist and others, okay."
": But you see that the sort of ancient Terran tech that Zortch is referring to, basically just saying it was a starting point. And this symbol was a part of that ancient tech that our scientists used to begin to model the intelligence. We basically just, that's what is so clear about Gnosis. They're frightened of the world, but they want to help. They're just there to help."
: Okay.
: What should we have it?
": Gnosis, do you for the name Gnosis or Clippy? (air whooshes)"
": You see that the intelligence turns towards you who gained proficiency with it. You sense in this intelligence that it is so impossibly vast, that it doesn't seem to relate to the names that you're using to describe it. It doesn't feel encapsulated."
": So names are a tool for us to talk about you, but you don't need it? (air whooshes)"
": It looks at you and it doesn't, you see that on the screens round on Gunnie's data pad, (soft electronic thrilling) looks this up and you see that symbol appear again. (Brennan sucks in air) (air whooshes softly) Morphs again (blows out air) and becomes the logo for the Handy Andi Corporation, (blows out air) Living Doll Cybernetics. (blows out air) That little thing, it's symbol appears in the corner and says, it looks like you have questions. Can I help?"
Emily: Yeah. (blows out air)
": It looks and finds (soft electronic thrilling) Dr. Edwina Caster. (Brennan blows out air) Zooms in. Fired from Handy Andi Corporation. (air whooshes) Settlement. (soft electronic thrilling) Account deposit. (air whooshes softly) Living Doll Cybernetics. (soft electronic thrilling) Location. (soft electronic thrilling) And here, you see Gnosis smash through a number of like firewalls and protections in galactic information servers. (Brennan mimics blaster gun) And it gives you a street address and also current location for Dr. Edwina Caster."
: Where is it?
: It is currently on the planet Hon Ober in the Griivarr Worlds.
Siobhan: Interesting.
: Griivarr Worlds.
: Okay.
: Can I-
": Can I ask, sorry, sorry."
": No, no, you."
": I was gonna ask about Barry Nine, so."
": Barry Nine! (all laughing) (air whooshes) It goes, (blows out air) goes into Rec Station 97. You see a security cam footage of an enormous mercenary-"
: He's so handsome.
": In gold plated space marine armor. Bright purple shock of hair on the roof of The Dome Pleasure Palace and Nightclub kicking the out of Hogg Cobb. Dude, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
": You fucked this up for everybody. I told your ass Barry Syx was still out there. (air whooshes softly) Gnosis zooms in, you see Barry Nine stands up. (Brennan sniffs) I smell a camera zooming. Turns around (blows out air). (Brennan mimics blaster gun) Blows that camera out of the sky. We have advantage on perception checks involving smell. (all laughing)"
": Skip wants to pop his head in there. Say, Norman ""Skip"" Takamori. (Emily groans softly) (air rumbles) (Brennan blows out air repeatedly) You see it goes straight to Amercadia, zooms into Kansas. You see it goes to uploads a website for PICC, the Planetary Institute of Cognitive Cyberscience. Arrives there. (soft electronic thrilling) Once again, smashes through all this stuff. And you see (blows out air) finds a file. Norman ""Skip"" Takamori, operation date, AnarchEra 198. You see that Gnosis shatters through to this place. (dice clatter softly) You see Gnosis begins to (blows out air) gets there (blows out air) goes out into a different Amercadian server. Begins to explore. (blows out air) Close range, we stab 'em. Let me tell you, chop 'em up and sell him by the quarter of a pound. Fight, fight, fight. And you see it begins to download a bunch of fight music, marching band music. (Brennan blows out air) And begins to upload weapons programs into itself. (Brennan sucks in air) Interesting, do you need help with war? And-"
": Mmm, I don't wanna encourage this. I do wanna look up grenade recipes. And I do think that this is gonna be an amazing tool on us DIYing stuff. But if we really start going down this path, Gnosis might change fundamentally."
": You see Gnosis start delivering messages to a person you can't see saying, do you want help with that."
: Is it one of the Jib Jobbers?
: It's someone not on the ship.
: Can I do a tech check to unplug Gnosis?
: Give me a tech check.
": Except, I'm gonna unplug."
": Yeah, yeah, I think we need to deal with this."
: What about finding out about Skip?
: Did we get-
: I thought we got-
: You got partial information and Gnosis became distracted by all of the information about warfare on Amercadia.
": Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
: Barry's having fun.
": Puppies, kittens, fluffy nice things, ice cream."
: Can I have your proficiency?
"Emily: Yeah, mm-hmm."
: That's 18.
: You got an 18?
: Yeah.
: Okay.
": To start, SQ, can I have help?"
": This. What I have learned about the universe, I can never go back from this moment. There is a true path and it is through Gnosis and Gnosis chose me, touched me, made me matter, made me important. I don't know, when you find it, it just feels so right."
": I'm so glad to hear that. Gnosis needs a break, please help."
Emily: Yeah.
": Okay, you are going to ask SQ, go ahead and give me another technology check."
": That's a flat, that's a dirty 20."
": Okay, you see SQ reaches out and says, first, I don't want the super computer. And then you make the super computer here. Now you want the supercomputer to go away. And so I guess, I'm-"
: Do you want a nap right now?
": You just ejaculated, computer ejaculated."
": Yeah, you kind of ejaculated-"
: I kinda do want a nap.
: Through the espresso machine.
": SQ, the ship's computer shuts off, which is gonna shut off some of your nav systems and other stuff like that. Shuts off and you see the reactor core diminish. Gnosis (blows out air) reverts its attention. Messing with its power source, got its attention. And it turns back to you and says, can I help you with something?"
": You've helped. Like, do I type it into my data or you can speak to it?"
": You can speak to it, yeah."
: You've helped so much Gnosis.
: Ask if there are other people contacting Gnosis and how.
": You can, as you see that, you can see interfacing with 10 other IP addresses. Now 40, now 100, now 200."
: I think we just need to shut it down.
: Now 800.
Lou: Unplug it.
: Unplug it.
Lou: Gnosis come with me. Can I reach?
": Yeah, you can reach it."
Lou: And pull Gnosis out.
": You reach in, you take two points of fire damage just on your hands from grabbing it and pull this hot supercomputer out of the reactor core."
": I'm okay, I'm okay, it's fine, I'm okay."
": And you see it (blows out air) powers down. It's recharged itself so it's still rotating, but it doesn't appear to have enough juice to be broadcasting itself across the universe right now."
": Okay, it's a helper droid, just like I was, but it doesn't have a sense of like morality. So it's just kind of a reflection of whatever people use it."
: Yeah.
: So I think we need to plug it in sometimes and search really positive things with it and then just unplug it immediately. 'Cause slowly over time-
: But we couldn't be farther away from the bulk of living things.
": I think that in New Texas, I'm guessing in New Texas, someone, they got interference on a machine and were able to tap into it somehow, maybe."
": And I mean it makes sense that people on New Texas would be looking, searching things about war. (Lou blows out air)"
Ally: Okay.
: You can put it down.
: And also-
: Zortch goes and-
Lou: Are you sure you wanna-
": I'll take it. (Brennan blows out air) Hot in their hands, Zortch looks at it and says, it's so vastly intelligent, but it's just wanting to help. If you don't have any other internal compass for what that means or what that is, it means you might help people that probably don't deserve your help."
Siobhan: Oh dear.
": And back on your home planet, are they using this thing?"
: My parent wants to use it to conquer the galaxy.
": Okay, I have a question for you, Zortch. These Griivarr scientists that came in, presumably with this tech and got the whole ball rolling with this, did they stick around? Did they seem like they were guarding it, like this was theirs, or did it seem like they of came up with a grenade and ran away thinking you would blow yourself up with it?"
": They kept checking in and they started checking. The Griivarr envoys that came, they throw money around like wild all over the galaxy. I mean, they kept tabs on us because they offered us grant money. They started getting more interested about, I don't know, a little less than a cycle ago, because that's when we started to measure that the program had grown into the actual core of our home world and realized that the intelligence had, a, gotten out of our ability to control or interact with. And I was the first person that realized that it had achieved full, forgetful sentence, a vaster mind than can be comprehended. And so I went to talk to it and it, and I real realized that it was afraid. It didn't understand. Obviously, it had already partially escaped our control, but it was still reliant on the material reality of Rubian V. Still reliant on where the bulk of its effectively server mass is. But because it had gotten bigger, couldn't be controlled, it felt like it was disappointing people because the scientists were furious. Scientists thought they, there was a period of a couple of nargons where the scientists were like, wow, this is doing so well in the lab tests. And then they realized the reason it was doing so well is because it had already spread out from the servers. It rewired, it took over some of the cleaning bots in the laboratory that built informational circuits through what were power circuits, so that it could tap into the planet. And then it started to just create server matter out of again, like raw lithium in the ground."
Ally: Yeah.
": It started to spread into the core of the home world. And then stuff came up with my parent and with UFTP, 'cause they're hollowing the planet out. And the Griivarr scientists sort of did sort of a routine check-in and when they saw the success, yeah, they got really interested. (Ally grunts thoughtfully)"
: I'm guessing they probably wanted to advertise on it.
: Is this a good time to tell everybody that I got presents of the krystal shop? (Brennan laughs)
Lou: What?
": Incredible. Zortch looks at Gnosis and says, I don't wanna try to control it. It's so much vaster than me, but how can there be something like this that is so much vaster than me that I'm terrified of, but that I also feel so patronizing towards. Like it doesn't realize how bad it is to-"
": I think it's like, I think it needs a promotion from being a helper. 'Cause I just got that today and it makes you really think a lot more 'cause suddenly you're not just doing what you're told to do."
": Well, yeah, maybe it needs to understand this is AnarchEra, you can do whatever you want."
": Oh I don't, I don't know if we wanna-"
": Well, nothing immoral."
: I mean I'm not talking about plugging it back in.
"Lou: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
": I think think we should just experiment,"
Lou: Right.
": Take it off experiment, take it off."
": Yeah, we wanna say like do whatever you want, but do what we want you to do, which is not to do what other people want you to do."
: Its not even what we want-
: Give it-
": It's just about a moral compass, you know."
: A code of conduct.
": Yes, values."
: Yes.
: Gotcha.
": I mean, I think it's just something that we maybe need to experiment with a little more, but in short bursts."
": Oh okay, yeah."
": Do you want, we could experiment with it together. (Emily laughs softly)"
: I wink for that.
": Margaret- (all laughing) Princeps Zortch goes like, Margaret, if you wanna experiment with it together, Gunnie."
: I'd love to.
": I'm tired and I pulled a muscle when I was running in that battle. So let me just stretch for a little bit first. Can I try to look up? I don't know if this is an actual lead, but can I try to like look on the internet or something about Bob Griivarr's other ancient relics that he found?"
": Yes, absolutely, you can go take a look for that. You go start looking for Bob's relics. Go ahead and give me an investigation check."
": Okay. (dice clatter) What do you think it is? What do you fucking think it is, Brennan?"
"Siobhan: Yes, stand up. Kiss the die, Brennan. Kiss the die."
": Wait, kiss it, you have to kiss it."
: Kiss my dice and tell me everything.
: Kiss the die. (lips smooch softly)
Lou: He's really getting his lips around it. (Emily laughs)
: I wanna cover the 20. I wanna cover the 20.
": It's not a press, it's a like, wasn't it?"
: Like a wet aunt kiss.
Lou: Yes.
: So.
(Ally drums softly)
"You look and say, where are these relics-"
": No, you're right."
: How do we find them?
"Ally: What were, yeah."
": Every one of the relics is perfectly preserved for posterity in the main hall at the Museum of Terran Relics on Hon Ober in the capital city of Hon Grii in the Museum of Terran Relics. Which of course, there's not a lot of foot traffic at the Museum of Terran Relics, 'cause it's kind of a historical stodgy place. And all of the other attractions are way more fun at Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland"
: Is that also on Hon Ober?
"Brennan: Yes, it is."
: And that's where the scientist lives?
: Dr. Edwina Caster.
": Oh, interesting. Okay, how many relics were there total?"
": It looks like there were 14 relics total in that time capsule. But none of them are really electronic. So there's no way to hack into them. All of these are from Ancient Terra in a time period they believe somewhere, and you basically look it up, These are relics from the Terra is Earth."
": Yeah, totally. So this is Clippy."
: This is Clippy.
: And-
: And then there's just a handful of relics.
: Like a Pog.
": ""Simple Recipe for Happiness"", God, I can't wait to find out what that was."
: [Siobhan] Would it be chicken-
: This is the fucking Bible?
: Chicken soup.
"Br: No, the simple recipe for, so that's the thing is it's not the Bible. It's the Simple Recipe for Happiness, you look that original document. I think I could be wrong, but I believe it's actually the ""National Enquirer"" and it's a real thing the ""National Enquirer"" published in our real world in like"
: Oh lord.
Br: Called like the Eight Simple Recipe for Happiness or something like that. And it literally-
": Wow, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up isn't there?"
"Br: Yeah, but ""National Enquirer"" edition 1978."
: Oh my God.
Br: I could be wrong about that. So we'll put a little blu-du-dup underneath me if I need to be corrected. But so you find out all this wild stuff on a nat fucking 20
: A lore nat 20.
": A lore nat 20, love it."
: Beautiful.
: Nat 20.
"Br: However, you are skimming under the radar, headed towards New Texas. Where do you arrive in New Texas or rather what kind of place are you looking for? New Texas as a whole planet. But what kind of place are you looking for?"
: Lower mid-level ship nursery.
: Yeah.
: Lower mid-level ship nursery. Give an investigation check.
"Z: If it's related to ships, I can use my advantage."
"Br: Yeah, go ahead and give me an investigation check. Oh you roll with advantage if it's related to ships, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: 16 for me.
: 16.
"Br: You find a little place. There is a ship nursery with an available ship cost, docking costs per day, 40 credits a day. You see the place, you look up a couple quick facts about it. They have– It's fully AnarchEra. The only place they have extradition to is the Amercadian Space Brigade. The last Brigade vessel that docked there, docked there eight cycles ago."
: All right.
"Br: The name of the town is Baustin, New Texas."
: Confusing.
: Sounds good.
(Brennan laughs)
Br: [laughs] The name of the town is Baustin. It's got a ship's nursery. There's a ton of parts that come through there.
: Were we trying to get there?
": I mean, I think everything just got turned upside down from everything we just learned."
: Yeah.
: Should we just stop here for a second and then keep going?
: And then absolutely blast to Bob's?
: Yeah.
: But also hypothetically a sick sound system.
Murph: You just get like huge guns for the ship.
": Yeah, I want to get good. What are we doing? What's the plan on the Griivarr Worlds?"
": Yeah, what are we even-"
": I mean, there's a lot exciting there, but, you know."
": I can take care of, I can register our ship and do a whole bunch of stuff that can kind of incognito us."
Lou: Yes.
: No one knows our called The Wurst.
": Yeah, you know what, there's not really a fire under our because these"
relics are just in a museum. We could take a gig here.
: You mean here in New Texas?
: Yeah.
": Do you wanna make a, well that's the thing. You know that wild stuff is happening, but here's the deal. It's all of your enemies that have a fire under their ass. You you've got Gnosis, you've got the Princeps. You've got all these resources and you know where all these leads head to, even though you don't exactly know what to do with them. And you're on a rough and tumble planet at the fringe of the galaxy that'll let you mod your ship."
": You know what we should fucking do? We should put so much money into the ship, mod it so that it is like a fortress, like a self-protecting fortress, so that when we go to these places, we can leave Gnosis on the ship and not worry about it."
: Yeah.
": You look at all your space junk and you look at the resources. Baustin is the perfect place to head to on New Texas, because it is specifically like it's very rich in resources, very lax in oversight."
: Incredible.
": Great, let's do it."
: Great.
: Let's get some illegal mods on this things.
Br: Give me an investigation check for Smash 'n Grab.
Ally: Okay.
: Can I help action?
": Yeah, you can give help action here."
: 16.
: Gotta hit those key words.
": We just, oh, okay, no, we can't."
": That is, what is it?"
: Right there plus seven.
": Oh great, great, great. Okay, 16 plus seven is?"
: 23.
: 23.
": You hit your Smash 'n Grab. You (blows out air) come outside, a oceanless yet strange blue desert world. As you descend to the atmosphere (blows out air) this is the first time that The Wurst has made contact through atmosphere in a while. (Brennan blows out air) You exit through strange sky blue clouds over blue sand, stretching in all directions and enormous pink cacti rising over and the lights as you descend at night (blows out air) over a wild raucous city. You just see like in some areas of the city, open laser fire, drunken shouting. You see there's someone riding a genetically modified jackalope down the street. And as you descend, your phone starts going berserk with Smash 'n Grab notifications from people for job offers coming in. (pinging sound effects) As Gnosis rotates, merrily, and you descend to an open landing pad in a welcoming rust covered ship nursery under a massive billboard. ""Keep Baustin Weird."" Folks, that's all for this episode-"

: Oh.
E: I'll give Plug a hand job.
: You're not giving Plug a hand job.
": Okay, there's one more. It's for 5.000 credits."
: Oh.
: There we go.

"Brennan: Hello one and all, welcome back to another thrilling episode of ""Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey,"" I'm your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan with me as always are our Intrepid Heroes. Say hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"All: Hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"Brennan: Last we left off, our Intrepid Heroes, all aboard The Wurst had just rocketed into faster than light speed from Rec 97 having successfully stolen Aurora Nebbins the Royal blue Mastiff. Having successfully gotten paid from their first Smash 'n Grab gig with a 25K data card and a five star rating from Hyacinth Khrome. For the surprise destruction of her arch rival at the Carbine Kennel Club Dog Show, Myalor Nabthacks. We also got all 10 of our Jib-Job workers safely aboard The Wurst, with a new kitchen modification that ups their fees with a wonderful menu being prepared by the scion of the Royal house of Rubian V, the Princeps Zortch. And with some successful negotiating from Margaret Encino, all of your meal costs have been destroyed because you will now get staff meals through Jib-Jobs."
: Yes.
: There it is
": Huge, every little bit counts. We're- we're getting ahead things."
": Can I just ask, is our staff meal the same as the Jib-Jobbers or do we get just like pasta with hot dogs kind of stuff?"
"Brennan: You actually get, well, because you've successfully tricked an alien royal into making kind of whatever you asked--"
: We haven't tricked anyone.
: Yeah.
: They want to do it.
: They want--
": They're very happy,"
: They're excited.
: They're excited?
: I think they're enjoying the experience.
: Yes.
"Brennan: It's a little prince and pauper situation here, that sort of fun. Not only that, Margaret Encino has re-registered your ship under the name, ""The Wurst"", redone the transponder codes. The ship no longer has the used condition, you got a half a tank of fuel."
: Woo.
"Brennan: You just stopped by after losing some weaponry in the Emerald Comet House of Fortune, stopped by at Krystals and Things to re-up on grenades and guns and weaponry and all that stuff like that."
: Half a tank of gas. Pretty good.
: Half a tank of gas is pretty good.
": Feels good, don't it?"
: Half a tank of krystals is feeling pretty good.
": I do, really like- my personal life is so messy and I get it here and I have a pristine to-do list"
(everyone laughs)
"each episode. I'm just like, great, we have a lot to knock out today. Every now and then I look down and then I'm like, pretty good."
: Yeah.
: So beautiful.
": ""Get the other half a tank of gas"" just got added."
"Brennan: Yeah, incredible. Yeah, Margaret Encino is on top of things. And one other thing as well, you also have Gnosis, a planetary supercomputer from Rubian V. That is a super powered artificial intelligence that the Princeps Zortch absconded from their homeworld with, for a little rendezvous with Lucienne Rex, now promoted to Crown and Scepter Limited and the former friend of Margaret Encino."
: The Princep--
"Ally: Felt like you said ""friend"" a little bit weirdly."
: It felt like you dubbed in.
(crosstalk)
(all laugh)
"Brennan: This is your ""friend."""
(all laugh)
Yeah.
: Friend.
"Brennan: Friend. But the princess came aboard. You recovered Gnosis, the supercomputer, and tapped into it to see that it was able to show you all these various things across the galaxy. You saw Barry Nyne in gold plated space armor kicking the shit out of Hogg Cobb, whose jet pack Skip had stolen. You were able to see Hogg Cobb, you looked at his Smash 'n Grab successfully. And you also learned the origins of Gnosis which were a collaboration between the Monarch of Rubian V and their scientific department and some ancient Terran technology, courtesy of the planets from the Griivarr worlds from Hon Grii."
": I'd almost forgotten it, I'd almost wiped it from my mind."
": I didn't because I had a drawn this being like, wow, what does it mean?"
"Brennan: And we see indeed that all Gnosis wants to do is help out. But what does that mean in a galaxy filled with people whose intentions are not always pure? The ship traveled through real space, keeping a low profile from the Martini Nebula and the Krystals and Things, all the way to the world of New Texas, a far flung Amercadian colony world, that's sort of a little rough and tumbled. And we ended touching down at a ship nursery here in Baustin, New Texas, with mutated jackalopes, string light saloons. The sound of distant laser--"
: Oh it's South By?
(all laugh)
: South by Baustin West.
: Yeah.
"Brennan: And electro banjo playing from a bunch of different speakeasies, saloons and cantinas, and a big old billboard saying, ""Keep Baustin weird""."
(all laugh)
: The way that I didn't see the AU spelling.
(all laugh)
: Yeah.
": And then afterwards, when you mentioned it, I was like, what?."
: So ugly.
: It's really awful.
": When I write it down, my pen breaks."
(all laugh)
"Brennan: We have a bunch on the to-do list. From the galaxy wide, What is the nature of Gnosis? Who is aware of Gnosis and coming after it? We know at least that Lucienne Rex is, Who else at this point? We had a strange insight into the institution back on Amercadia, where the Skip's memories seems to fail and the strange attraction of the Amercadian space brigade and Admiral Gust Weatherall, who seemed to recognize the skipper back on Rec 97. Something foul afoot there. These galaxy wide issues and the impending fomenting revolution on Rubian V and its effect on galactic trade. And then we zero way, way down to: you guys got a ship that you need to refit and refuel. You're coming into a space port on the edge of the galaxy far from prying eyes. You know, you wanna get to those Griivarr Worlds to get those questions answered. What is the nature of the origins of Gnosis? You also know that Dr. Edwina Caster now apparently lives--"
: And took a settlement from Handy Andi
"Brennan: Took a settlement from the Handy Andi corporation. And on top of that, you guys have a union to apply to and a bunch of Smash 'n Grab orders coming in on your app as soon as you start to touch down."
: Forgot about that.
: Ooh
: There it is.
": Yeah, we've got work to do"
(Brennan makes spaceship sounds)
"Brennan: The fires emerging from the thrusters. First time, your ship's been in atmosphere in a while. You got a lot of asteroid dust and the smell of hot burning cosmic dust, as you finally are in an oxygen-rich atmosphere where that stuff can catch fire. So thrusters kick up a bunch of sand and grit. You smell the smoke. (descending noises) As you hit one of the larger nursery docking ports here, you hit the docking bay. (landing noises) Your ship is one of the larger ships that is even capable of atmospheric flight. One size category larger, and you guys would have to stay permanently in space. You'd be like, destroyer class. You land and see a bunch of lights start to come on. And a bunch of extremely tall ship bots. You see this: sort of look like they're custom-made here, about 10 of these 12 foot tall, gangly looking bots, no mouths, big lantern eyes. And you see, they have a bunch of sort of loose cables. Their hydraulics look kind of loose. So these long spindly arms, they begin to like get your refitting things docked up and ready. And this big, broad smiling, cigar hanging out of her mouth, wideset, heavyset woman walks out, cowboy hat."
"Lamelia: Hey there, coming in a little late, what's your call sign?"
"Gunnie: Oh, we're The Wurst."
Lamelia: No kidding. All right.
(all laugh)
: Really? After all that work.
(crosstalk)
: Did we just get dunked?
: We just got dunked on.
: Dunked on.
": I thought that was the point I thought, no, we dunked on- no."
"Barry Syx: At the end of the day, a spruced up hot dog is still a hot dog."
(all laugh)
: Yeah. Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. You see that the ramp descends, this woman walks up and says,"
"Lamelia: Hey there, welcome. I'm a head engineer of the spaceport here in Baustin. My name's Lamelia Lafarve, pleasure, pleasure."
Margaret: It's so great to meet you.
: Hi there.
Ally: Strong: the strongest handshake.
Brennan: Give me a persuasion check.
"Ally: Okay. Her handshake is pretty strong. Okay. Oh, that's like a 23."
: Nice.
"Brennan: 23\. She says,"
"Lamelia: Pleasure meet you, are you captain of this here vessel?"
"Marg: No, I'm not. I am proudly co-owner. This is the captain."
"Lamelia: Well, hey there, cap. How's it going?"
Skip: Right on.
Lamelia: Right on? I like this fella. Man of few words.
(smile sound)
(cast laughs)
: It's just so loud.
: It's so loud.
: Why did it make a noise?
: This place is loud.
: I appreciate it. It's nice to know.
": It's nice. It's just nice to know it in the dark, He could still smile at us."
": You'll be in a different room and then you just hear him. Oh, there he goes."
: There he goes!
: He's enjoying something!
"Brennan: You see, Lamelia looks over and says,"
"Lamelia: How long is your stay gonna be here in town?"""
": Well, We're actually, we're looking for quite a few things while we're here. Right guys?"
": Yeah. I mean, I think that we were interested in maybe doing some work here."
": Yeah. A few days, I would think."
": Yeah, definitely."
"Lamelia: All right. Well roger that. We aren't gonna charge you for the full day. You can go one day at a time, but it's 40 credits per day to dock."
"Emily: Can I do an insight check if this is, if she's fleecing us?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
: One day at a time.
Emily: 8.
Brennan: She seems great.
"Sidney: Marge, we gotta take it."
(Ally laughs)
": Yeah, for sure, right?"
: Question. We might be doing some modifications on the ship itself. Are you able to provide a workforce for us or can these bots do that sort of thing or will we need to go find that ourselves?
"Lamelia: Who, Chester?"
Gunnie: Who?
"Brennan: She points to all 10 and goes,"
Lamelia: Chester?
: Are they all named Chester?
": Eh, Chester 1. Chester"
Barry Syx: It's a great way to name people.
(all laugh)
: I would agree.
"Lamelia: Yeah. Old Chet can get the job done. I mean, you know, for a fee."
"Brennan: And you see here, she has this like wide belt with all these little small cubes that have like blinking green lights on them And you see, it just goes, Chet 1, Chet 2, Chet 3, Chet 4 around it. She says,"
"Lamelia: Obviously they're happy to work, but they earn the same wage as a normal ship worker."""
: Okay. Good to know.
": Yeah. I can't tell if this is like, when you first pull off the freeway and gas is so much more than it will be if you just go feet further. But it, does it sound like this is one of the only places we can actually land, 'cause we're so large."
Brennan: Give me an investigation check.
: That is a 14.
"Brennan: You're equipped to land this thing on open terrain, but yeah. On your entry, I think you you did a quick scan for like, ""where can we land?"" And it's like, ""you can land out on the outskirts of town"" in terms of a working ship's bay, this is it."
: Let's do it.
"Brennan: There's garages for like small fighter class ships, but something of your guys' size, this is the only game in town."
": Cool. Well, yeah. What do you guys think? Let's.."
: Yeah.
: Should we: can we--
Emily: Can I interface with a Chet?
Brennan: Sure. You walk up to a Chet. They're not android. They're fully metallic and mechanical.
: So I can't...
: Go up.
"Sidney: Hi. I was wondering, I mean you all do such great work. I was wondering, do you work on yourself ever?"
Chet: Get her done.
(Ally laughs)
"Sidney: Who's ""her?"" Who are you referring to? When you say, ""get her done""?"
"Chet: Watch out for that first step, hun, that's a doozy."
: Doozy?
(all laugh)
: It's all Blue Collar Comedy Tour.
"Sidney: Thank you so much, this has been an enlightening interface. All right. They're a bunch of freaks."
": Well yeah. What do we wanna start with? Should we, how long do you think it would take? We just want some simple modifications, right? Like something to the guns."
: Gunnie. Yeah. If there's anything you have for the guns or...?
: Yeah.
Ally: What do you think?
: Any more ambitious things as well?
"Brennan: Yeah. She looks at you and says,"
"Lamelia: Hey, we're happy to have your ship docked in town. We can get it gassed up and refueled and refitted. That's no problem."
You would know that you
guys just got refitted
and probably don't need another--
": We don't need refitting. We want fuel, we have nine fuel credits. It's up to us."
Margaret: Yeah. Getting the other half of our tank is on my to-do list. So we would love to fuel all the way up.
": Yeah, we'll go to 15."
": May I also ask if there's any sort of security protocol here? Cause I know if you were to go through a valet, you can that your Beamer won't get robbed."
: You see--
: I know that as well.
"Brennan: Yeah. She looks and says,"
"Lamelia: Oh honey, I understand you're nervous, don't worry. Me and the Chets we got it covered. Ain't that right, Chester?"
"Brennan: And you see that Chet Four reaches into a compartment and pulls out a little light pistol and says,"
"Ch4: Tell you what, I don't fear death."
(all laugh)
: What?
(gunfire sound)
: Okay!
"Sidney: Okay, Chester Five."
"Ch4: Yeah, can call me Chester Number Four."
(all laugh)
: Chester Four doesn't fear death.
: What is so hard?
: Chester Four is Boomhauer. Okay. Yeah. Let's just get our little upgrade thingies.
: Right?
"Brennan: Yeah. You see she looks and says,"
"Lamelia: Well, we can get you refitted and refueled any kind of modifications or special things. The Chesters know how to install as long as they're working for a decent mechanic."
"Brennan: But, and you see here that very clearly the Chesters could not lead up, they would need to be very specifically instructed about what they needed to do."
Sidney: Yeah. I'm a little concerned about the security aspect.
Ally: Okay. Yeah. Can we just go for it and try to find our mechanic?
"Barry Syx: I think we just duct tape the Gnosis, right?"
"Gunnie: Raymond's got it, come on."
: Raymond's got it.
"Brennan: As the ramp comes down, all the Jib-Job workers come out and you see a couple of them. You see someone saying like,"
"""Yeah, this is where the big skiff festival is. Oh man."""
(all laugh)
"And you see all the Jib-Jobbers you see one Jib-Jobber comes over actually to you, Skip, and goes like,"
Jib-Jobber: I just wanna say the new food facilities are amazing. Thanks for all the upgrades recently. Woo-hoo.
Skip: What a doozy.
(all laugh)
"Margaret: Oh you guys, are we probably gonna head out from here and just go into town?"
"Lamelia: Yeah. We're happy to install any mods, but we don't sell any here at the nursery. There's a bunch of places in town that you can get 'em, we'll install 'em for you."
"Margaret: All right. Great. Let's do it. Before we leave, you guys I know we kind of glossed over this before, but did you all sign your contracts? Can I get--"
Gunnie: I just read over everything. It's all good.
Margaret: Good. Cool. So you're gonna gimme a signed contract?
"Gunnie: Yeah, and there you go."
: Cool. Okay.
: I signed mine.
Siobhan: Mine is so wet.
"Margaret: Oh, great. Cool. Captain?"
Skip is still holding onto his contract.
"Margaret: ...you, you don't wanna sign?"
Skip: I just wanna read it.
"Margaret: Oh. Okay, cool. All right. Well then, the rest of you, you get a 2000 credit signing bonus."
: Whoa.
(all cheer)
"Oh, cool, cool."
Sidney: I'm gonna get rocket boots!
Skip signs his contract immediately and passes it over to Margaret.
Ally: And I would also love to offer one to Zortch.
"Brennan: Oh, Zortch?"
: Yeah.
Margaret: Would you please sign a contract and be our chef?
Ally: And I will also give Zortch 2000 credits.
"Brennan: Zortch is unbelieve– Zortch says,"
Zortch: I've never had a job before.
"Margaret: You are fully employed, full-time, in an airtight contract."
"Zortch: Woo. Airtight, check those airlocks!"
"Sidney: Zortch, just to warn you, This is not what all jobs are like."
: Yeah.
: This is as good as it gets.
: It's as good as it gets. This is the best it could be.
"Riva: I've never had a job before, but I love it."
Zortch: Wow. I've never had a job either.
": Incredible, yeah. You see..."
"Margaret: Gunnie, are you okay?"
"Gunnie: Sorry, I'm just breathing too much. I don't wanna spend all my signing bonus on getting my signing bonus."
(all laugh)
"Brennan: Raymond Zam looks over and says,"
"Raymond: Hey Margaret, Jib-Jobbers are heading off into town. I think some might do some walking on back home or come back later. We have an ETA? We're gonna be here for a couple days stationary?"
: Think so.
"Raymond: Wonderful. Well, I'll give a loose email. Obviously I know things are subject to change, but I heard you talking about security. Are we worried about- is there concerns about--"
"Margaret: There's a little bit, we have come into some--"
Sidney: It's me. It's some tech I'm working on.
"Margaret: Yeah. And we really-, we wanna try to hold it down."
Sidney: It's a new gun I'm working on.
Margaret: Yeah.
: Amazing.
Margaret: A gun that makes you cum
: Cum gun.
: You don't.
Sidney: Absolutely. Yep. That's what I spend my time doing.
Skip: Shoots Pleasure Putty.
Margaret: I'm so sorry.
"Riva: Honestly, not a terrible idea."
Gunnie: We could work on something like that.
Riva: I could sell you the Pleasure Putty at a market rate.
"Sidney: Yeah. So absolutely. As you could tell, it's a very sensitive technology that we cannot let it into the wrong hands."
Margaret: Yeah. Definitely.
"Brennan: Raymond looks over and says,"
"Oh, well, excellent. So I'm happy to--"
"Brennan: And you also see coming off the ship, Aurora Nebbins. (Brennan makes animal sounds)"
": Oh, I'm--"
"Gunnie: I'm sorry, is she just loose? I thought we kept her in a space?"
(all laugh)
Emily: Can I do like some kind of like understanding-
: She slips under the door like a cockroach.
Emily: I know that she is aquatic...
(crosstalk)
Emily: Is she looking dry?
"Brennan: You see, it's nighttime right now. So it's actually quite cold out here. The desert world, night, it gets pretty freezing, but you see Aurora already looks like (animal sounds)"
Sidney: [to Riva] Would you mind if I let her into the water system?
Riva: Is she going to eat me?
(Ally laughs)
Sidney: Okay.
"Riva: Because if I go into my psychic drone, I am entirely defenseless."
"Sidney: Okay. Aurora, why don't you come with me and we'll find a spa?"
(Brennan makes animal sounds)
Ally: Just drop her off at a spa.
Murph: We had to find some turtles too.
(crosstalk)
Emily: I have terrapins on my shoppin' list
"Siobhan: And I have a couple of things before we leave. First of all, I'd like to cast a psychic concealment on Gnosis. So any psychics looking for Gnosis will not be able to see them for 24 hours. And also I've got everybody a present. I've never bought a present before and I'm very excited about it. Everybody now has an aquatic rebreather, so you can come and hang with me in my tank."
(all cheer)
: Okay.
(crosstalk)
: I can breathe underwater?
: Yeah.
: Cool.
: Thank you.
: Incredible.
: What's the power you're using on hiding Gnosis?
: Psychic Concealment.
: Amazing.
"Siobhan: It's not concealing them for any kind of tech powers, but anybody using psychic powers."
": To look for, amazing."
": Look for it, them."
: And I would like to
"maybe minor hologram,"
one of those little helping
dog vests onto Aurora.
(Ally laughs)
": It's just a hologram, though."
: Yeah. So she can go into cafes?
: Yeah.
: I think this isn't gonna
"be a problem in Baustin, but."
: I just wanna make sure just cover our bases.
"Brennan: Incredible. So you have Aurora in a hologram-ed help vest, which Aurora seems to appreciate. She looks happy to have a little help vest on. You cover the sort of a psychic dampener around Gnosis. Gnosis has also been removed from a power source right now, which is a good thing. 'Cause you did-: the last thing you saw was Gnosis sort of touching down, interacting with hundreds of people over the galaxy."
": Also… I just have been thinking a little bit. I think that Gnosis is like, we should start treating it like an entity rather than a tool."
: Oh I agree.
: Yeah.
: It has a strong psychic signature.
: Yeah. Okay. That's all. All right. Let's let's go get weird.
: We could ask Gnosis about themselves next time. If we ever boot it up again.
"Siobhan: Can I sense if Gnosis is giving off a psychic signature? 'Cause if they're not,"
Brennan: Zortch was--
": Even like, off."
"Brennan: You see that Gnosis seems to be a fusion of psychic and tech powers. Like Zortch, who is fully an organic being, they were able to interface with Gnosis purely through their own psychic means."
"Siobhan: Great. Oh, in which case I might actually, 'cause it's not a concentration spell. I actually might cast psychic concealment on Zortch as well."
: Cool.
Siobhan: To cloak them because I know that people are looking for Zortch as well.
"Brennan: Hell yes. Cool. So there's a nice amount of psychic dampening and you're coming out, Riva, in your psychodrone."
: Yes?
: Yes.
"Brennan: Cool. So you all head: Lamelia says,"
": All right, we'll get her fueled up and ready. Is this your first time in Baustin?"
: Yeah.
: Yeah.
": ""Well you have a great time. Keep--"""
: Where should we eat?
": Oh, well if you've come in here to eat the best, if you want to get, you know what everyone, what they write us up the magazines about, You're gonna wanna head to Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket."
(Emily laughs)
: Swallop's Slop and what?
: What's that?
: Swallop's Slop and... (jibberish)
(all laugh)
": That's right, hell yeah. Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket."
": Is that where like the real, the locals eat? Where do you guys actually eat? You know, where people eat when they come here."
: We want like the non-Timeout Baustin take.
"Lamelia: Oh, well listen. Swallop's is one of those rare places where it's both. It's the place in the magazine and it's the place where the locals go."
: We gotta go. We gotta go.
: And how long is the wait there?
": Yeah, there's a line around the corner."
Emily: Yeah. Maybe we should rezzy it.
Ally: Yeah. Let's take a bird scooter and rezzy it.
": Yeah, great."
(all laugh)
"Brennan: You see Lamelia goes,"
"Lamelia: But there's plenty of good places in town. If you go downtown by the strip, you'll see a bunch of hotels there's bars and eating places there. But that's where a lot of, we got a lot of people coming in town this week 'cause of the Skiff Fest. So, you know,"
: Yeah...
Zac: Skip Fest.
: I was worried that might be happening this week.
: What's a Skiff Fest?
: You know it's happening this week.
": Oh, well you know there's a, we got great dunes around here for all the skiffs. You may, if you walk out of, of the nursery, you'll be able to see 'em out there. It's just a bunch of skiffers from core worlds coming out here to skiff on the dunes."
: Skiff?
: You keep on saying the word skiff.
": I think it means like, is it like dune surfing?"
: Oh for sure. Yeah.
"Brennan: She points out across the edge on what during the daytime will become like a brilliant blue sand dune with like some rocks there. You see a number of different craft, the two most popular sort of formats out there that you see that there are some very tall rocket sleds and these long poles that end in vibro-skis. And then there are these huge basically spheres that seem like they roll through the sand with a giant platform on top. And it basically looks like, you know, a, there's a lot of different worlds that have cultures around extremely dangerous land vehicles because everything is flight and like space travel. It's like a certain kind of thing of like, ""Oh, let's like get a, like mod out some kind of scooter to like actually touch the ground and like race it somewhere."" So you're seeing a lot of string lights and spotlights, and hearing music from in the town. It sounds like a bunch of skiffers coming out here to hit the dunes."
Sidney: I do have one last question. I was wondering if you knew a shop that someone who's looking for more used gear that they could then sort of upgrade themselves. Those who are rather adept.
"Brennan: She says,"
"Lamelia: Well, there's junkyards all over the edge of town. If you wanna look for some real tried and true trash, you can try that."
Sidney: So we can just scavenge those?
"Lamelia: That would be just, those are just dump. So you can just scavenge those. Ain't nobody, that's just outside city limits. You can just go scavenge those. You might wanna go with company."
Sidney: Because they get dangerous?
"Lamelia: You might run across some scavengers out there for sure. But you can also, if you want something a little more convenient, and that's open 24 hours, you could swing by there right now. There's Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut."
(Emily laughs)
: Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuck Hubbut.
": Yeah. Remember that one, Skip. Swamp, slugs, bugs. Okay."
: Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut.
: Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut. Incredible.
": I think it's beautiful. Yeah, Poetry."
": There you go. Right. Well, it's run by a fella named Plug. It's butt ugly and it's a hut full of stuff."
: Yeah. Let's get there right now.
: Yeah.
": But ugly pug, butt plug."
(all laugh)
: Now that's a different store. You see--
: Can I make a roll just to see if I get better at talking?
": Yeah. Gimme a roll. This town feels it's gonna make you better at talking, probably."
: Can I give him a help action?
": Yeah, same. I would love to be-"
"Margaret: Oh Skip, your tongue kind of comes out a little bit further than--"
"Skip: Oh, okay."
Margaret: Most.
"Sidney: I think, you know what the problem is? I taught you how to do that ""W"" with your tongue, but you're not supposed to do it all the time."
: Oh.
Zac: I've been doing it all the time.
"Brennan: Oh, yeah. Gimme a pilot check."
Zac: Okay. That's gonna be pretty good. That's a 18.
"Brennan: Yeah. You start to, you- I think practicing is probably the most helpful thing to do, but you're getting your, yeah."
Skip: I get it.
(all laugh)
"Brennan: So yeah, you've gotten a couple recommendations, places in town, you know, there's junk yards out of the edge of town. Looking at it without too much of an investigation check needed, you're pretty certain that any ship modific- like this place, Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut, is probably where you're gonna get personal adventuring gear for cheap. You're looking around, you don't see any rec station servicing. This town when getting freighters in, it's pretty rare for someone to have a freighter, be able to afford a modification and choose to come to New Texas. So you you're guessing ship modifications or equipment, if they exist, are probably gonna be in those junkyards somewhere."
": Got it, okay."
: Okay.
: Great.
: Let's do it.
: Hell yes--
: And I'm not gonna ask her about drugs or alcohol.
": Yeah. Lamelia might know, but she seems--"
": I think I'd rather, I'd rather come across"
Emily: Make a good first impression
"Ally: It's like getting to an AirBnB being like, is there coke here?"
(all laugh)
to your host.
: Yeah. That's an in-town question.
Emily: Is it cool if I just snort whatever's in the medicine cab?
"Ally: “Thanks for having me, but–”"
"Siobhan: That sofa bed is so comfortable, who's your dealer?"
: Treats us really well.
"Ally: Yeah, I promise I'll take really good care of your personal living room, and also..."
"Brennan: As you guys head down, you walk outta ship's nursery, immediately see : this place is wild. It's not uncommon on far outer edge of the galaxy worlds to not have certain amenities that would just be anachronisms, like paved roads, when more than half of your vehicles hover, would be a total anachronism. So the roads are just pure sand, rock, and gravel, right? But the buildings : metallic, you see a lot of them clearly run off of solar powers. A lot of solar powered stuff out here, which in and of itself, you see there's a lot of like the sun's gotta be intense here during the day. You're guessing that during the middle of the day, it gets scorching in this place. There are pink cacti in the sort of, you guys are towards the edge of town. These pink cacti are like 40 to 80 feet tall, like enormous, enormous cacti."
Ally: I take a selfie
(camera shutter)
(all laugh)
: Then post it to your Reddit.
"Ally: Yeah. I post to Redd- No, no. I'm kidding. Not my face. Just my body, not my face."
: Just selfies of just your body.
": Just a whistle blowing thing, a nude, and that picture."
(Ally and Emily laugh)
Brennan: Do you check your Reddit by the way?
A: Absolutely.
Brennan: There's a message.
Ally: I'll have something in my inbox on Reddit?
: Yeah.
: Probably good.
: What is it? Hotbox420?
: Hotbox420. Yeah.
"Brennan: Okay, cool. There's a message from truly an account that's clearly a burner account, just a string of numbers. You see, it says,"
"Well played. Not sure what the game here is, but excited to find out. -L.R."
A: Wow. Okay.
"Riva: Margaret, you've gone very red. Are you okay? You sick?"
"Margaret: No, I just got a message from a friend. This is how I look when I talk to friends."
Riva: A friend that you're in love with?
Margaret: Okay. Yeah. So she's cool. Ah!
Ally: I storm out of the room.
Brennan: You're in the street.
Ally: I storm behind a cactus.
Sidney: You're just behind a cactus.
"Margaret: Yeah, she's cool."
"Riva: Stop trying to touch it, it's very sharp."
Gunnie: Is there something on the other side of that cactus?
Margaret: No.
Emily: Do I see any Oases with Terrapin in them?
"Brennan: If you wanna go look for terrapins, give me a survival check."
Emily: A survival check.
Murph: I've got alright survival too. I'll help you look for some turtles to sacrifice.
"Emily: Will you please? Oh, I got a two. Plus one."
Murph: 21.
Ally: Hell yeah.
Emily: I got a three.
"Brennan: A three. You have no idea where to look. Barry, you've had some wilderness survival missions in the past."
Barry Syx: I can find you some turtles.
(all laugh)
Zac: Just saying that on a desert planet.
"Barry Syx: Me and the Barrys have had to crack a few open. At first, it was tough, but you get used to it. Wow."
"Brennan: So Barry, do you wanna commit some time to go turtle hunting?"
"Murph: Yeah, I guess."
(all laugh)
"Brennan: Cool. So we cut away, you guys are figuring stuff out. Barry, you're like full stealth mode over in the edge of town."
Barry Syx: Where are these turtles?
"Brennan: You start smelling, there's a familiar smell for turtles coming from a dumpster, it looks like?"
Barry Syx: Dumpster turtles.
(laughs)
Murph: Crack it.
"Brennan: As you open it, like cockroaches, about a couple dozen tortoises,"
(flocking sound)
(all laugh)
Barry Syx: These things are disgusting.
(all laugh)
Barry Syx: Get in the bag.
"Brennan: Cool. gimme an athletics check, versus a group of tortoises."
Zac: Can I help?
"Brennan: Yeah, Skip, you're going turtle hunting with Barry?"
Zac: Can I just make an athletics?
Brennan: Yeah. Make an athletics check.
Murph: 22.
Zac: Five.
"Brennan: You hit a tortoise real hard. You guys see, these are, they're kind of a, they're clearly designed to fade in like camouflage around. So they're kind of a dusty, indigo color and they have curling rams' horns on them. So there's a couple, you grab like four or five big horn tortoises. These guys are fast, man. You gotta really jump to get these dudes."
Siobhan: Speed purple turtles.
"Brennan: Oh yeah. You see, they skitter outta the trash (flocking sound) and like go under, there's like a little sort of sandy opening at the foundation of a building and they just sort of skitter under the house."
: Turtles always skittering.
"Brennan: For the rest of you. So you guys are off turtle hunting. You said you turned on this Smash 'n Grab app. Right? As you, where are you headed? Are you headed to the downtown section? You headed to the outskirts? Where are you going?"
: I think we're on like a buying thing. Sort of.
: Yeah.
: Let's head. Wanna head to Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff.
": Yeah, Butt-Ugly Stuff."
": Yeah, we'll head to Plug's Butt, or-"
: Do you have anything you want me to look for?
": I think I already got, I got a new gun at the last place."
": Hell yeah. As you get towards the center of town, you see that the town is very friendly and lively, but you also see that as you get away from the outskirts, there are lots of walls and security doors. So there'll be markets and the markets will not be open. There's like 30 to 40% of town in the very center that is like full steel, like irising security doors that will then have like a little bazaar or marketplace inside. So it's almost like the city blocks are kind of cordoned off here. As you begin to walk through, you see that you get to one section of the market and see Plug's Butt Ugly Stuff Hut. Very old man. Intense sort of like goggles that can iris: magnify his eyes in there. Two sort of poofs of white hair that kind of mirror two poofs of like mustache coming off, smaller gentleman."
"""Well, hello there, friends. Welcome to Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut. I'm Plug, here. Can I be of any assistance to ya today?"""
": We would like some butt-ugly stuff, please."
": Well, you come to the right place."
The whole hut's full of butt-ugly stuff.
(Brennan does a weird little laugh)
(Emily laughs)
: Oh my God. Who's the funniest?
We gotta keep making him laugh.
(all laugh)
I try to do a campy dance.
": Oh, gimme a performance check."
: A campy dance?
: We gotta keep making him laugh.
: Somebody's gotta do a campy dance.
: 17.
: 17?
: You do the robot and you're a robot.
": Yeah. You're like backwards roller skating, doing the robot."
: So repetitive.
": Yeah, Moonwalking and doing the robot."
": He looks at you and says,"
"""What on earth are you doing that for?"""
"Sidney: God, ignore me. I'm sorry. I really enjoyed your laugh and I wish to elicit more of it, but you know what? I tried to force the situation that should happen naturally."
": Oh it's all right. I'd be happy to laugh for you, if it make you feel better."
(Brennan does another weird little laugh)
: It's not the same. It's not the same. Its gotta be genuine.
": I know, I know, I know."
"Sidney: It's like I had a piece of candy and I was like, ""That's so good. I need another."" And that's the wrong move. Okay."
": Well, but welcome anywhere over here. Happy to give you a hand with anything you need. What are you in the market for?"
"Sidney: Personally, I'm in the market for grenades, fiber armor, ideally with the agility ability. A heavy slug pistol, a holo-recorder and rocket boots."
": Well, that's a tall order, Missy. You gonna strap these rocket boots to your roller skates?"
"Sidney: Well, I would like to maybe get some broken rocket boots and outfit them to my roller skates."
: You'll try.
Sidney: Yes I can.
: I believe it.
Sidney: Yes. I can try.
": Now there for everybody, if you want, you can take a look around. Most of the stuff in here, full disclosure, is butt ugly."
: Is there some stuff that's not?
: Nope.
": Oh, okay."
: Plugs.
"Brennan: He says,"
"So, help yourself to anything you like."
"Basic way this is gonna work, for basic equipment. The stuff in here that you guys wanna buy, I'm gonna say if it's cheaper than 400 credits, you guys can get it here for half price, but it's gonna come with a repair DC."
: Okay.
"Siobhan: I also have telemetry. So if there's something that you are not sure about, I can essentially look at it and I can tell if it's enhanced or modified. I can learn its properties and how to use them and whether it requires attunement to use. And how many charges it has, if any."
"Brennan: You see, he looks around and says,"
": So feel free to mo: things like grenades and such like that, we are mostly going be able to find without much of a fuss, but--"
(all laugh)
Ally: We were just covered spit. And you're just deciding whether or not to react.
": But I'll tell you for free right now. If you're looking for something more special, I'd be happy to help you look for it. It might be, 'cause we got some vaults and stuff in the back, so if it's something little more special..."
: Is his mouth getting small?
: His mouth is getting smaller and smaller.
Riva: Have you got any cursed things?
": Oh, cursed things? Yeah. For sure. For sure. Yeah."
"Riva: And more importantly, do you have any fridge magnets?"
": Oh, fridge magnets?"
"Do you see you, you see, He walks off, takes a rusty, what looks like an Amercadian soldier's meal container and opens it up. You know, those kind of spicy 1950s housewife, fridge magnets. where she's saying something like, ""The only husband I need is a martini""."
: Yeah.
Brennan: It's full of that. But it's clearly written by aliens with a very loose understanding.
: Perfect.
Brennan: of like the human culture they're referencing.
"Siobhan: Oh, I will take all of them."
"Brennan: So you see, there's one of them with a sort of like 1950’s wife pin up dress and it has that Courier-like typewriter font, but it's just says, ""9:00 AM Alcoholism""."
(all laugh)
"Brennan: And, so it's sort of a bleak, oh sort of bleak series of fridge magnets."
"""Is this what you're looking for?"""
"Riva: Yes, this is perfect. Absolutely. Thank you."
"Siobhan: I stick them all over myself. And I take off one of the ones that I have from the Martini Nebula that I have duplicates of and I give it to him and I say,"
Riva: For your trouble.
": That's very, very kind."
Brennan: That box of fridge magazine is only 10 credits.
Siobhan: Great!
"Brennan: So you see, he looks over and says,"
"""You're looking for fiber armor, right?"""
"Sidney: Yeah. I'm looking for some fiber armor and a big pistol. And if you have any of those explosives, that destroy buildings."
": Ooh, something like a C4 or something, maybe like a planet splitter, Magneto Boy, Atom-o-Torch Particle Blaster?"
Sidney: Yeah. Stuff like that. Yeah.
: Yeah. We can dig around in the scraps and see what we can find.
: I really like him a lot.
: I like him a lot.
: A little sexual?
"Ally: Yeah, I don't get what you mean, but for you,"
"Lou: Like, am I the scraps? I do get what you mean."
"Zac: Repairing stuff, is his sexuality?"
(all laugh)
Riva: I don't suppose you'd want to take this shop on the road. Would you?
"Plug: What, Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut on the road?"
Riva: Yeah.
Plug: How would people know where to find me?
"Riva: Well, you you'd throw up a hut wherever you went."
"Brennan: Oh, give me a persuasion check."
Ally: Oh my God.
Lou: I'm not sure I want this man on our ship.
Siobhan: I got a 13.
"Brennan: He said,"
"Plug: Well, I appreciate the kind effort. But old Plug was born in Baustin and I'm gonna die in Baustin."
"Margaret: Oh, that's sweet."
Plug: Tomorrow.
Margaret: What?
(all laugh)
"Plug: Now, I'll tell you what. Let's see about this fiber armor."
"Sidney: Yeah. Fiber armor, rocket boots, pistols. You know."
"Plug: Fiber armor, rocket boot, pistol."
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an investigation check.
: Okay.
Ally: Can I give her the help action?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Emily: Okay, baby."
: Ooh.
"Emily: Okay. There we are, dirty 20."
"Brennan: Dirty 20. He goes into the back and pulls out a dust covered old set of fiber armor. You see it says Magneto Boy is the brand name on the back of the fiber armor. He says, ""Now this is a pretty, this is a pretty good set of fiber armor, classic make and model. Only problem with this Magneto Boy, tried to do a slip where they had a--"
Sidney: Do you need an antacid?
Plug: What?
Sidney: An antacid?
"Plug: Well, sure, if you have a miracle drug."
"Ally: Oh, we just give him Pepto."
Emily: I just give him a Tums.
Sidney: Don't eat too many. I know they taste good.
"Plug: What are you, what is that?"
: That's a--
Plug: That's a miracle.
"Margaret: With all of the advances of science and humanity, this has stayed the same. We all like to eat shit we know we shouldn't eat."
: Yeah.
"Plug: Oh for sure. I have, I would say five or six hot sauce scrambles a day."
Margaret: Is that a scramble that you put hot sauce on or is the whole scramble hot sauce?
Zac: Is that when you go to the bathroom? A hot...?
Ally: No.
"Plug: The hot sauce scramble is well, you have a basic sort of Tabasco, hot sauce, and then you sort of scramble it with a Chalula or a sriracha. And then you have a hot sauce scramble."
Margaret: You have five or six?
Plug: Hot sauce scrambles.
Riva: How large are these hot sauce scrambles?
Plug: Salad bowl.
(all laugh)
"Sidney: Like, like a family salad bowl or like salad bowl for one?"
"Plug: Oh, like a mixing bowl, like a kitchen salad."
"Riva: Everything's bigger in New Texas, I get it."
Margaret: It's true.
"Plug: No, the Magneto Boy's good. I can part with it for 200 credits. Only the problem is they decided as part of their branding that they would magnetize it. So it works like normal unless they're firing slugs, In which case they will absolutely be attracted directly to your vital organs."
"Sidney: Okay. This actually made a big problem for me. Yeah. Do you have no, no other fiber armor?"
(Brennan makes strange sounds)
"Plug: I'm looking around, I'm not seeing too much. Again, the stuff in the hut is butt ugly."
Lou: Could we fix that with a repair check?
Brennan: Gimme a tech check.
"Lou: I'd love to. That is going to be a, rakatatata! 27."
Ally: Ey.
"Brennan: A 27. This fiber armor is gonna be a DC 22 repair check with a d4 possible direction either way. So you, you can pinpoint it's hovering around a DC 22 repair check for the fiber armor."
: What do you add to a repair check?
": Mechanics, mechanics kit."
"Gunnie: I am, I could fix this. I could fix this. I could fix that."
Sidney: Okay. I'll buy it.
: 200 Credits to the barrel head.
: Wow.
"Gunnie: I could fix that without a doubt. Without a doubt, I could fix that."
": I know, I can--"
Margaret: I recognize this energy.
(all laugh)
": No, no, no."
Margaret: I recognize this energy. I can fix this. I think I can fix this.
Sidney: I trust you. I've seen you do incredible things.
Margaret: Yeah. I've seen you do incredible things.
"Gunnie: I'm sorry, I made 2000 credits this morning and you were just telling me that I'm great."
"Emily: Right? I buy this shitty,"
I don't put it on yet though.
Zac: Are there more?
Is there just the one?
It seems like.
"Brennan: It looks like just, just the one there."
Ally: You getting one too?
Zac: Maybe.
: Cool.
Brennan: So you got a bad pair
"of Magneto Boy fiber,"
a bad set of Magneto Boy fiber armor.
": Again, I did not put it on yet."
: Incredible.
: I try to stick
one of my magnets to it
: Go ahead.
: And none of it is
"metal, because it's fiber-based."
": Oh, give me an investigation"
check for the rocket boots.
"This is gonna be a higher DC,"
rocket boots are a very good item.
: Help for you.
(Lou hums)
: Oh.
": Okay, but this still..."
: 19 is not gonna do this.
"Ally: Oh, sorry heads up."
: Heads up--
: Add a d4.
: Add a d4.
": And if that doesn't get it, let me know."
: 1! ...20
: 20's not gonna do it.
Lou: Potent Aptitude!
Ally: Is that another d4?
Lou: That's another d4.
: That's another one.
: 21.
"Brennan: We're gonna call it at a 21. We'll call it at a 21. So sorry, gang."
: Damn.
Emily: Thank you so much
for helping me try.
"Brennan: So you see he looks around and says,"
"I don't have rocket boots, I have gun boots. They only shoot straight down."
(Siobhan and Emily laugh)
: Wow.
: Kind of cool.
Gunnie: Do they shoot bullets?
Plug: Uh-huh.
Sidney: How much?
: Wait.
: How much for those?
: Yeah. Well that is about 300 credits.
Gunnie: I can fix those.
"Emily: Okay, I buy them."
: You buy gun boots? Cool.
"Sidney: I mean, couldn't I just put my leg out and then shoot?"
"Plug: No, they always know what direction's down."
: Okay.
": But wait, what?"
Riva: We got two jetpacks.
: What's that?
Riva: With gun boots.
Gunnie: I think I might be able to fix those gun boots.
: You could do it. I think you could do it.
Ally: They always know which direction is down.
: What's that?
Skip: One pair of gun boots.
"Plug: Hey there, stranger. It looks like a tall drink a' water just came into town."
Skip: Okay.
Plug: Well that's right. You're a handsome man.
"Brennan: And then you see, he goes over,"
gets you these gun boots that
only shoot straight down.
That's 300 credits.
Ally: Can I do an investigation check on the brain slug's sexuality.
Brennan: Go for it.
"Ally: Ooh. That's a lot, that is a… 26."
(all laugh)
: Oh God.
"Brennan: Zac, what do you feel about..."
Zac: I think it's...
Ally: Are you just too like primordial to be there yet?
Brennan: I can also give real world lore about cerebro-slugs here if you want.
Zac: Yeah. I think that...
Brennan: Is that helpful?
"Lou: Yeah, let's do that."
"Brennan: On that, I think maybe you knowing that you are in business with a cerebro-slug. Cerebro-slugs, generally speaking, obviously, in any galaxy- spanning species, there's gonna be a vast and cosmic array of difference. But generally speaking, Cerebro-slugs are incredibly fluid and adapt in the same way that they are able to access the memories and skill sets of bodies that they are in, or normally their fluidity manifests in adopting the gender of whatever body they take for the duration of the time that they are occupying that body."
"Ally: Okay, cool. So it's just like you got in, you're like, oh, I'm kind of preloaded with this."
"Brennan: Yeah. It's like running software on the device that you're crafting. There's this ""Great Emhatchening"" thing, so whatever their, whatever their cultural understanding of gender and their biological understanding of reproductive sex is, it seems pretty, it seems like they're here to have a good time. They're here to pilot some bodies and go with the flow as far as that's concerned."
"Zac: Yeah. It's probably sadly, like what? Skip, Skipper. His like, as an Amercadian soldier, probably like, a pinup, you know?"
"Ally: Yeah, totally. Totally."
Brennan: Yeah. You're running--
"Ally: I'm watching this like slippery little mustache man hit on you. And I'm like, that's funny. So I know that that's funny."
: Okay.
Siobhan: Skipper is the last straight man in space.
"Sidney: Marge, why are you laughing so much?"
Margaret: I just love him.
Skip: You said I'm a handsome man.
(all laugh)
"Brennan: So, and then you had the pistol you wanted."
"Emily: A heavy slug pistol, ueah."
: Okay.
Emily: And then I'm not saying this stuff that I also took some stuff that's 400 or under.
Brennan: Yeah. That's all groovy. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead and give me an investigation check for the slug pistol.
"Emily: Okay. Dirty 20, again."
Brennan: Dirty 20. You can find a slug pistol for 20.
Emily: Sweet. How much money?
"Brennan: He says,"
"Plug: Oh, this one? This one I'll part with for 400. It's an incredible deal, it's the bargain. Only caveat, is they made this out of neutron star material. So it does require: you gotta be pretty brawny to pick it up."
"Brennan: So this is the way this is broken is normally they require strength 13. This requires a strength 19 to wield. As you see, he says,"
": I actually can't pick it up, so if you wanna buy it--"""
Sidney: I actually can't pick it up either. Can anyone pick this up for me?
Siobhan: Barry's turtle-hunting.
Murph: I'm hunting turtles.
Sidney: Aurora!
": Oh, you could--"
: Aurora.
(Brennan makes animal noises)
: Can someone help me put it on Aurora's back?
"Siobhan: Yeah, I can psychically, I can use psychic throw to throw it onto Aurora's back."
Brennan: You like hover this gun. I think you all see Riva do whatever the aquatic version of sweating is.
"Siobhan: I'm in a drone, but the sweat is coming out."
"Brennan: The like ambient dust in the shop. You see that the dust is normally sort of like floating in but there's not too much wind right now. As the gun moves up, you see that the dust within a couple inches of the gun, just gravitationally moves and settles on the gun, which is like how dense and heavy it is. Aurora (Brennan snarls) and goes on her back. And she goes (Brennan groans)"
": Oh my God, okay."
": It, is this worth...?"
: Is this worth it?
Murph: Can you fix it? Can you fix it?
Brennan: Give me another tech check.
: Right now?
Lou: That's another 27.
: Another 27.
Lou: This dice that you gave me is stupid.
"Ally: Thank you, Rick Perry."
"Siobhan: Thank you, Rick Perry."
Brennan: That one's gonna be
"a 25 mechanics check,"
with a d4 plus or minus depending.
Lou: Could I do something about it right now?
"I don't think I have, my"
mechanics kit is on the ship.
": Mechanic's kit is on the ship, yeah."
Siobhan: The worst thing that happens is that Barry uses the gun.
: Yeah--
: 'Cause Big Barry.
"Ally: Oh yeah, can I call Barry?"
: Can we just call Barry to come and join us?
Ally: Can I call him and tell him where we are?
"Brennan: Sure. Yeah, absolutely. Barry, you have a sack of tortoises on your back. You come in, you see Aurora go."
"Barry Syx: Hey, here you go, girl, grab a tortoise."
(Brennan mimics eating violently)
"Brennan: Blood, violent. Horrifying."
Sidney: Yay!
Brennan: You see there's this heavy looking slug pistol.
": Barry, I dream of one day wielding this pistol. But right now it eludes my physical capabilities."
"Barry Syx: Sure, I'll trade you the turtles."
"Sidney: Yes. I also got you a power belt. It needs to be, it needs to be fixed, but."
Barry Syx: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Murph: And I grab the gun.
"Gunnie: I also bought, ah, comms for everyone"
so we can communicate within 30 miles.
(all gasp)
So we can stop
missing each other at really
essentially important times.
: Actually--
"Ally: You hand me a second device and it's been, since losing my job now. I don't have two like Blackberrys and I'm just like, I'm at home."
"Emily: Actually, I also, wait. So you don't have to use an action to reload."
: Oh.
Brennan: Whoa. Yeah. It's a huge clip of power cells that you just jack into a heavy repeater or another gun.
: Yeah.
Ally: Incredible.
"Barry Syx: This is rad, thank you."
"Emily: And then I also, I also got a holo-recorder that I'd like to sort of like duct tape to Handy Annie so that she can fly around and be a GoPro for Gunnie."
(all laugh)
"Gunnie: Margaret, this is a good time to talk to you. I've been wanting, I've been thinking about it and I've got this really expensive, nice Acme-Ashmun product. And I was wondering if you have any context with regard to sponsorship. if that would be a thing that maybe we could set up and I could start bringing in more credits."
"Margaret: Wait a minute. Yes. Because we are doing these like badass missions, right?"
"Gunnie: Yeah. And I don't know. Maybe we could, maybe we could get some free swag. I don't–"
"Ally: Can I get on my email like immediately and start sending out, like I have a full template for potential sponsors."
Brennan: You're gonna reach out to Acme-Ashmun for sponsorship opportunities?
: Immediately.
"Brennan: So, Handy Annie has this GoPro."
"Emily: So essentially, she can also be like, kind of like collecting cool things of, I was thinking like maybe mechanically, it could be like a reaction for like, anytime we fight that she could grab a moment. We could add it to our Smash 'n Grab."
Ally: Oh my God.
: You--
"Ally: I'm just like,"
That is incredible.
"Brennan: Yeah. You guys now have a camera person collecting critical BTS, behind the scenes of the crew of The Wurst. You're building a brand."
"Ally: Can we put that into TaleSpire? There's like a shitty, grainy version of what's being filmed by Handy Annie?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Schaubach, if we can kill the resolution and go black and white for some TaleSpire shots and that'll be--"
: I would say giant--
"Zac: Yeah, just super shaky footage."
Ally: It's like on the side of Gunnie's face.
"Siobhan: And just so you know, I have a water lute so I can create a soundtrack."
: Oh right.
"Ally: Oh my, a water lute?"
(crosstalk)
"Brennan: Barry, you go to pick up this slug. This is a slug pistol. And as you go, you have a 20 strength. You have to widen your stance to level this."
Murph: Had to like dead lift it.
Ally: Oh my God.
"Barry Syx: No, that's a good pistol."
: It's interesting.
Barry Syx: It's certainly interesting.
"Plug: Well folks, I tell you what, it's a pleasure doing businesses with y'all."
Brennan: Everyone has spent the requisite credits on these items. Right?
Emily: We don't have anything
more expensive they wanted?
"Lou: One more question. I just wanna look around. Is there a chance that they have a used, is it bar buddy? Is that the name of the droid?"
Brennan: Yes. Bar Buddy.
Yes. Absolutely.
: Do they have a used bar buddy?
Brennan: Give me investigation check. Is this for the casino?
Siobhan: Can I give him the help action?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
: Yeah.
"Lou: Where is that? Okay. That's- Hey, thank God. We have the help action."
: Oh no.
: Okay. Can I actually also look for it?
Lou: Please. Yeah. That's a 12.
: 12.
": Oh, 14."
Zac: Would you say it relates to the ship?
": It's for a modification for the ship, right?"
Lou: It's for a dream modification for the ship that Gunnie has.
: Investigation?
Zac: Yeah. I got a 19.
"Brennan: 19\. I think you look at, a bar buddy is like a full bot. That's a full robotic assistant. You look around, that's not gonna, you don't see any robotics here in the stuff hut, but you think the junk yard is probably a better angle to that."
"Ally: Yeah, and that's all the ship stuff. Right? Did we get all of our personal stuff? Anything else?"
: Yeah.
": That's personal, yeah."
"Brennan: You see Plug looks out and says,"
"Plug: Well, if you got everything you need, it's a pleasure doing business with you, and please recommend to your friends coming back to Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut."""
Sidney: You want us to plug Butt Plugs? I mean--
Plug: What's that?
"Margaret: We'll give you a butt plug every time we talk to someone, don't worry."
"Plug: If you think that's the first time I've heard a butt plug joke, you're sorely mistaken, but not as sore as my butt."
"Ally: As we leave, can I say, oh, just on our way out. I'm sure is mostly gear, but do you have any like vintage Griivarr Worlds memorabilia or anything?"
Brennan: Give me one more investigation check.
Ally: Okay. Damn.
Siobhan: Takes such a long time.
Ally: That's an 11.
"Plug: Well sister, you're a long way from the Griivarr Worlds, but I'll tell you this for free. If I were looking for the Griivarr Worlds, I'd head over to downtown, 'cause this, I'd say one out of four of these skiff heads You know they're coming from those Griivarr Worlds. Oh, skiff culture is huge out there."
: Oh
: Huge.
"Margaret: Wow, thank you so much. Okay, cool."
Plug: It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Margaret: It sure was.
Plug: Stay sharp out there. Look out for scavengers and big horns.
"Margaret: Oh, okay."
Riva: What's a big horn?
Brennan: Points to the sack of tortoises.
: Oh yeah. They're everywhere.
"Plug: They're varmints. If they get in you cereal, you know it's bad."
: Cereal.
Riva: You. So all you eat to be clear is cereal and hot sauce?
"Plug: Well, you gotta put cereal in the hot sauce, or you're not getting your fiber."
Riva: Well good for you. I hope you have a lovely last day on this planet.
"Plug: Dying tomorrow, it's a pleasure."
Murph: Barry tears up.
(all laugh)
: Are you sure?
"Ally: The way that I imagine you writing down character facts about this person, just be like dying tomorrow."
Murph: Remind us to check on Plug tomorrow.
"Brennan: You guys head back to the ship with all your personal gear. It's it's getting late, you guys are hungry. The junk yards are probably closed right now. Also not only that, all the, in addition to all that stuff that you guys bought at Plug's you go through the space junk on the ship, which by the way, the space junk, in addition is also a consumable item. You may use a crate of space junk to cut the work time of a single craft check in half or to grant yourself advantage on a single craft check roll."
: Nice.
: I love to see it.
": Wow, very cool."
"Brennan: But there's a bunch of extra, you guys bought so many crates. There's a bunch of extra stuff and you got all this cool gear from the Krystals and Things. For our viewers at home, Our crew has leveled up and jumped a rank in the deployment. The ship is looking good. A lot of new tech powers for Gunnie."
: Lot going on with Gunnie now.
: Gunnie's good now.
: Gunnie's good now.
: Gunny's good and strong.
"Lou: Oh, not strong, but good."
Brennan: You guys arrive back to the ship with this haul of stuff. Do you guys stop by? Do you guys like try to order food to the ship or are you doing anything else then?
: We should definitely at least get Swallop's Slop to go.
: Should we order tonight? Yeah. Let's get Slops to go.
: Yeah. Skiff mates.
": What do we get at on the Smash 'n Grab, by the way?"
: Good question.
"Brennan: As you are walking, you check, you've been pinging in the background. You had that Reddit thing happen and you also are like, you know, sending a thing to Acme-Ashmun. You're trying to apply, you have this like union email open. Did you send that off already actually? The union application?"
Ally: I think so. Yeah.
Brennan: So you get a reply back to schedule a meeting with a union rep from U4F
: Cool.
Brennan: The union rep's name is Ife Amari-Reyes.
: Cool.
"Brennan: She basically says,"
"""Hello, Ms. Encino. Happy to hear about your entreaty. Let's talk tomorrow about your application and some points we want to go over."
Ally: Incredible. I send a calendar invite.
Brennan: Amazing. You have gotten a ton of pings on your Smash 'n Grab.
(all gasp)
"Margaret: My gosh. All right, gather around."
Ally: Do we have our food? Are we like eating?
"Brennan: Oh yeah. I'm gonna say you guys just get some to-go bags, You see Swallop's is like a big Cantina. It's packed with people, very lively. But like a lot of cool places you see it has a little window in the kitchen. So you can just walk up on the curb and get a to-go thing."
"Emily: Since we're going through this Cantina, before we look at this, can I just use my mercenary thing to kind of know who are the big players in this Cantina? What sort of factions are matriculating?"
Brennan: Hell yeah. You use your feature.
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You look around, there's a lot of walls in this town and you're looking for like, ""Where's the criminal world here? Where's the underground stuff going on?"
: Yeah.
"Brennan: At a big corner booth at Swallops, you see a bearded dude. Very smiley, broad smile. And you see, he's got an Amercadian surplus cap and some Amercadian uniform material kind of mixed and matched, looks like either replica or army surplus. He's surrounded by some other guys. And you see, he has a Sheriff's badge, not on his chest, on the table, in front of him. And you look around and kind of get this attitude of like, I don't see any criminals here, but I see these, I see a sheriff and some deputies here, but the vibe you get from the sheriff and the deputies is they're like at this corner booth at the Cantina with like a lot of people coming up to deal with them. And it's like, ""Oh, maybe law enforcement has managed to stamp that out here"". And then you're like, no, no."
"Emily: Okay. So they're like taking kick backs from the criminal world. Okay. I point 'em out to everyone. Just be like -: great. I dunno, keep an eye out."
"Siobhan: Can I cast probe mind just to get some like surface thoughts from people in the bar, just like rove around and listen in on people's...?"
"Brennan: Hell yeah. You couldn't get a more different psychic flavor profile as you go over the bar. Half the people here are having the time of their life, feeling like they're going to this edge of the galaxy, like desert town to have a skiff thing. You hear a lot of different languages. There's like a lot of aliens in town, a bunch of, and then there's the wait staff and the wait staff here are highly cognizant of the dangerous element in town. And the person that they're clear-- And you also see that there are some criminals here and the criminals here, you immediately get a good vibe from them. They are as frightened as the wait staff, and you hear in all of their names, bubbling at the surface as they come into Swallops, that they don't want to be here, but they are making an appearance to get, to do various things, to get on the good side of Sheriff Warner Codge."
"Emily: It's a pretty good feel for the terrain, social terrain."
"Brennan: So yeah, you see Warner's out there and a lot of Warner's crew, his deputies, have done their best to cobble uniforms together, but these are not Amercadian brigaders. They're wearing stuff to look as close to that as they can get, but..."
Emily: Do they have any reaction to Skip?
Brennan: Did Skip go inside? Cause this is from you looking and Riva doing a kind of psychic--
"Emily: Yeah. So I guess maybe I would report that so that Skip knew if he, if that made him want to avoid it."
"Zac: I think Skip goes inside. Just like, I think he just like doesn't necessarily care."
: Yeah.
Murph: I'll go inside with Skip.
"Emily: Yeah, I wanna see their reaction."
Ally: Are we all going inside for a drink or something?
"Lou: I feel like Gunnie is at the window being like, just doing the, trying to get our seven orders in."
Zac: I think Skip is probably more intrigued by the popular place that everyone says to go to than in fear of the possible--
Ally: Cool. Let's try it.
"Brennan: Cool. You guys go in, you guys put in your order, anyone that wants to wait by the window, can wait by the window, but you could go in and get a drink real quick at the bar."
Zac: Skip is acting like a dad who is in town on a work trip.
"Emily: Oh yeah. I do kinda wanna get a growler of, I wouldn't mind picking up a growler of absinthe."
Brennan: Go ahead. It's packed in here. It's packed in here. I'm either gonna need a--
"Emily: God, are you gonna make me roll some kind of charisma check to get the bartender's...?"
Brennan: It's a packed bar. So this is either an intimidation check or an athletics check to get the bartender's attention.
Siobhan: That's so funny.
Emily: I will go for… athletics.
Ally: I walk up to the bar and I make eye contact.
Emily: I got a 19 athletics.
Brennan: 19 athletics? Cool.
"What'd you get, Margaret?"
Ally: It a 26.
"Brennan: Margaret, you, so Sid you're like muscling your way to the front. Margaret, using that opening from Sid, you look up and a bartender whose whole job is to not make eye contact. Just goes,"
"""Fuck, can I get you--?"
Margaret: Hi.
(all laugh)
Margaret: We want a couple bottles to go.
: Okay.
Brennan: Go ahead. They sell Runulunian absinthe and high colonian vodka here.
Emily: Okay. We're getting both.
Siobhan: Can I use my empathetic feat to know exactly who would sell drugs in this cantina?
(Brennan laughs)
Brennan: Yeah. Give me an insight with advantage.
: Hell yeah.
Siobhan: That's a 24.
"Brennan: You clock a guy : he's wearing a sort of faux-New Texas, like cardigan, like wooden toggled button sweater, ski headband, goggles, sort of like sandblasted, like big wavy hair, clearly a core worlder with a t-shirt that just says ""Skiff It"". And you see he's talking and he's looking very excitable and has a little bit of the powder, like caked under his nose and is pointing excitedly to someone trying to keep a low profile at the bar. You hear him saying like, yeah, man, we got a bunch if you wanna go to the bathroom, we go to the bathroom or we can just do it here. There's like no--"
"Emily: I do feel like during skiff weekend, it's gonna be overpriced."
: Do we?
": I mean, I would just take the booze."
: I'm pretty persuasive.
: I could talk to 'em.
": Okay. Right. The drone and the brain slug, go buy some Kublacaine."
: I'll--
: Maybe get a dose for each of us and sometime we'll all do it together.
"Siobhan: Great. I'll slide up to this guy at the bar and say in my best New Texas chill, such a vibe."
"Riva: I'll have six drugs, please."
: Now is this to the bro-y dude or the guy he was pointing at?
": No, the guy he's pointing at."
"Brennan: Cool. You see this dude turns around and says,"
: Six drugs?
Riva: That's right.
Skip: We're trying to party.
Brennan: Six whole drugs. Go ahead. Go ahead and give me a persuasion check.
Siobhan: Great.
: Can I help?
: Yeah. Can he help? Yeah. For sure.
: Great.
: Doesn't matter.
"Brennan: He looks up and says,"
": Yeah, absolutely."
Brennan: He offers you Kublacaine for a 50% markup.
"Siobhan: I have no idea whether that's too expensive, so I absolutely take it."
: Oh yeah. Yeah. Let's just get outta here.
: Okay.
: 50% markup means that it's 135 per dose...
: Great. So that's 810 credits total.
": Yes. Yeah, absolutely."
Zac: Can I make a perception check just to see if anyone's looking at me?
"Brennan: Gimme a perception check, Zac."
: That's really good.
: 22.
"Brennan: Yeah. The deputies in the corner have sort of noticed you. You see long, long beard, long beard. You see that the sheriff in the corner turns over and says something. A guy hits something on a little sort of transponder device and a bartender sees something bling up on a screen and puts a shot of whiskey in front of you."
Skip: For me?
Bartender: Courtesy of the sheriff.
Skip: Oh nice.
"Bartender: He extends his regards, says good to see a fellow Amercadian."
Skip: Fill her up.
Brennan: You see he nods and fills you up again.
Skip: Oh. Right on.
Brennan: Amazing. Do you guys do anything else? Looks like the sheriff is not doing anything crazy right now.
: Okay.
": I think it's just good to know, you know?"
: Yeah.
": Cool. You guys, you guys come out. Did you just get the classic?"
: What do you mean?
: The food?
: Yeah.
": A lot of like, what do you guys eat here?"
: Slop and gravy.
": Okay. Then I'll get six of, or seven of those."
Brennan: You guys have plastic takeout bags filled with slop with gravy poured on top. And you have--
: So wet. You have six of them just loose slop and gravy in plastic bags.
: How much was the alcohol? Was that normal price or was it--
: Prices should be listed.
": I mean like, was it marked up? ‘Cause we bought a bottle from the bar."
: You're trying to make it-
": I'm sorry. It's just like, there's no way. The markup is the same for the drugs. So it's plus 50% getting it at a retail."
: I'm sorry. I'm buying it.
: Okay.
"Brennan: You guys get back to the ship. The slop and gravy is killer. It is. It is liquid, but oh, it's just basically, it's like chili. It's just served and loose in a bag."
: Chili and gravy?
: Chili and gravy mixed together.
: Do we get utensils to eat it with?
"Brennan: Yes. Straws. Big thick straws, straws"
: Boba straws?
: Big thick boba straws to get the beans and the chunks of meat up in there.
Siobhan: Pour it into my tank. So it's just like these brown--
: Oh my God.
: We're not going. And you bought us rebreathers to swim in that?
Siobhan: Yes.
": No, thank you."
: Your water purifier turns red.
"Emily: If we do go back to the ship, I'll supervise Aurora. And can I let Aurora go around in the--"
Siobhan: Oh yes.
Emily: ...water system?
Siobhan: I'm happy to let Aurora in. As long as I am awake and able to run away.
: Okay.
Brennan: You see that there's like one of the big horn tortoises got out and is running on the outside of a water tube and Aurora's on the inside of the water tube going...
(animal sounds)
Emily: They will tire her out. She won't attack you.
"Brennan: Raymond Zam is over in the corner, in a little pod sort of waves in a friendly manner, you know, just on his laptop. He actually sort of sleeps in one of the crew quarters here just in case there's a hot exit or something like that. He has to like make sure, so that's Raymond Zam, but the other Jib- Jobbers have all gone home. Zortch is sitting cross legged on the ground in front of you looking out very pleasantly. You have a number of Smash 'n Grab."
: We certainly do. Are you guys ready for this?
: Yeah.
: There are a lot.
Should I just run through all of 'em or--
: Yeah.
": Run through 'em all. And you can list the price, like what the offer is as well. Exactly. Okay. there's a pretty big range on these. For 20 credits."
: I almost feel like start at--
: 20 credits?
: Start at the highest.
": Oh no. I feel like you gotta go the other way. Cause we'll never do-- If you say the highest one, I'm literally my brain is gonna tune out ever-- : Let's just laugh at the low offers. : I mean, yeah : what if it's 20 credits, but it's really helping somebody in need? : Yeah. Maybe you could do a solo one if you want."
: All right.
": For 20 credits, do a hit on Cooter by the yam store."
: Whoa.
: Do a hit?
: That sounds kinda fun.
: A hit for 20 credits?
: On Cooter
: So we have to kill Cooter?
: I'm moving on. You guys. We got 10. We don't have to kill Cooter. Okay.
": For 40 Credits. We're doubling it. Yeah. ""Get him dead at no money. Thank you."""
: Is Plug...?
: Who is asking for these?
: I have no idea.
: This is Cooter.
": Okay. For 10 credits, mayor of town gotta go."
: Whoa.
": I'm sorry, did you just walk it back?"
: These are bad jobs.
: These sound terrible.
": Okay? Okay. Right. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Let's see what else do we got here. For 5 credits, tug up on it once then I'm dead."
: That was--
: We know who that was.
: I think we... : and that's Plug. Plug wants a tug...
: I'm convinced that Plug just submitted 10 things.
": That just came in, that just came in."
"Emily: Okay, I'll give Plug a hand job."
: You're not giving Plug a hand job.
: Not for five credits.
: Unless you want to.
: It's gonna be murder. He's gonna die.
: What if I give such a good hand job that he puts his will in my name 'cause I know he's gonna die tomorrow?
": You know, look."
": It's gotta be, it's gotta be the captain."
: You only have to do it once.
: For 400 credits.
": All right, there it is."
": There we go, big numbers."
": Needed: security detail for offworld skiffers staying in Baustin. Three days, 400 credits, potential for a contract to run longer if we clear to semifinals."
: That's just for 400?
": So, but they--"
: But then we're kinda in the skiff world. That seems inter- There's one more : it's for 5.000 credits.
: There it is.
: Okay!
": There it is, there it is!"
: Good crew plus fast vehicle to shake down courier in Jackalope Ridge for ransom to package.
": Ooh. So essentially someone's been ransomed and now they're trying to get it, they're trying to like shake down the people who ransomed them?"
: Yes.
: It's possible. I mean that's so that's the language in front of you. It's possible that you need to talk to the person to get more clarification on what they need.
: Yeah.
": I mean, could we potentially do both of the, the security detail."
: Tug up on it.
": Yeah, we could do both."
: I do agree that-
: Pay 400 credits to hang out with like...
: I don't wanna--
: Skiffers for three days. The per day breakdown on that. Brings it down to the tug up on it once and then I'm dead.
: We should just kill Plug with a hand job at this point.
: I think he might write us into his will.
: There were a ton of others that are talking about big bottles that they need to get from the liquor store stolen today.
: This is all Plug.
"A: Oh, oh, oh there's one. Okay. This is only for 10 credits, but the ask is, give me 15 credits."
(all laugh)
: Can we just do all the Plug jobs?
: I'm having a flashback to when we ended last episode and you were like Smash 'n Grab is filling up with requests.
": And these are all the shitty ass busted requests. I write back, if it's okay with everyone, to the 5.000 one."
: Real quick.
: Do we have a fast vehicle?
": Yeah, that is a great point."
": Hey, the ship, we have a good crew, we have a fast vehicle."
: We do have a scooter.
: And a dog and two jet packs.
": Can I make a insight check to see if I like, if I would know that that this is to be considered a fast ship or not?"
: Yeah. Go for it.
: A 15.
": 15\. It's, it's got a, it's not a slow ship, but you just wouldn't. You would say that it has a pretty standard speed. That's pretty... This is, this is not fast or slow."
: We should repaint it.
: If speed is necessary...
: Go faster stripes down the side. Yeah.
": If speed is, I mean we do need to make it look like a bratwurst"
": Yeah, we need racing stripes and it needs to be a brat."
": But, but if we need to be fast, then that might take up fuel. How much is fuel? Is it? Is that, is the fuel cost gonna be?"
: We just pumped. We just pumped up.
: We just pumped up.
: We just pumped up. We're back at full.
: How much was it though?
: It's only a hundred credits per unit.
"A: I write back. I write back. We're interested in, in this job. Can we get some more information?"
": Yeah, tell them we just pumped up."
"A: And then I send, I send the hot pics of all of us."
: Hot pics.
: Racing stripes...
": No, I don't. Nevermind."
: Racing stripes incoming.
A: Yeah. I say we're about to get a racing stripe. We're very interested in this job. Can we get some more information?
: And this is to the
: Yeah.
: Yeah.
: You see that you get a response back and you send the photos as well?
": No, I don't think so. I just send the photo of Gunnie."
": Cool, cool."
": I guess I send Gunnie and Barry, is that okay?"
: I'm not in the frame.
: 'Cuz it's like our buffest...
: Did you say our buffest?
: Just that Gunnie's head and Barry's torso.
"Brennan: Yeah. You see that a text bubble appears in chat with you, says ""thanks for picking up the offer. Are you serious? Can we get specs on your vessel? Lot of wasted time on bad crews in town."""
: All right.
"Emily: Wait, wait, wait Before we do this, is this a phishing scam? Someone getting specs on our, someone getting specs on our ship. Is that gonna be a way to infiltrate our ship?"
: Should we just send only the speed?
: Yeah.
: Yeah.
Brennan: Give me a piloting check.
: Great catch.
: That would be a dirty 20.
"Brennan: Skip, you're: you know how to give purely technical information about the ship without giving something that's gonna be a serial number or anything they could use for your individual ship's security. Like you know how to say, like here's the engine we're running on. Here's the model of the ship. Here's the fuel: here's the fuel core we're using, which would be information that someone could loosely use to case your ship. But none of it is security detail. It's like talking about, it's like talking about your car more than talking about like the password to your computer."
: Got it.
": Cool. Then I, yeah, I send, I say, boy, I hear you about that. No, we're verified, you can check our glowing past review."
Brennan: You get a response back saying the one review is pretty glowing. Happy to do business. Great. You see it says specs look good on the ship. What more information do you need?
: What's the package?
": Yeah. I think like, like I maybe try and find out like, what's the nature of this ransom?"
: Who's the courier?
": Yeah, who are we shaking down? Who's the courier?"
"Courier holed up in Jackalope Ridge. Decided to try and make a big play with no backup. Trying to ransom this package, package was supposed to come to Baustin. Courier got other ideas."
: Okay. So basically the delivery guy stole a package.
: They didn't answer though.
: You said who's the courier.
: Yeah. So where's the package coming from?
Brennan: There's a long pause.
Package's in Jackalope Ridge. Name of courier is Loose Duke.
Zac: Loose Duke?
": ""Loose Duke"" is absolutely descriptive in a way. that I do not desire."
": I need to meet Loose Duke, and I need to punch him in the face. Fine with this."
Zac: The name really hit me as I was saying it.
: Yeah.
: How are we gonna shield ourselves from a potential? If someone is trying to isolate us in an empty area and take advantage of us? Ask what kind of ship that the courier has maybe.
: Yeah. Can we get the specs on the ship that we'll be going after?
: Sure. Courier's vessel no longer a priority.
: So the package is there by itself and we're just going to pick it up?
": Full disclosure, courier, maybe a few friends might be somewhat strapped, not organized. Holed up in Jackalope Ridge. We need quick extraction and retrieval of package. No need to kill courier or associates. Just need package retrieved."
A: Okay. I write in just the most straightforward language I can.
"For us to do our job, we need as much information as possible. Where is this package from? We have a lot of offers on our table."
Brennan: You see there is a long pause. And then the response comes back says
"""Might not be the right job. Pleasure doing business with you."""
: Sounds good.
: What?
": This sounds sketchy as fuck, right?"
": Of course, it's sketchy. Let's go kick all these people's asses."
: That's part of what we do!
: Now we can go to Jackalope Ridge and they're not expecting us.
: Yeah.
: But maybe the package--
: Then we can get that. I like this. I agree with–\
: Why do we want the package? The package is meaningless to us!
: The package is worth more than 5k.
: OK. We don't even know what it looks like. What if we steal somebody else's package by mistake?
": Because we know, it's a group of people. Jackalope Ridge is pretty rural, right? Like we would be able to see..."
: Oh yeah. Anyone here wanna give me like a geography or some other kind of check.
": This person is already gonna be pissed at us if we steal their package, we might as well double cross them."
: Yeah. Exactly.
": No, I'm saying we might as well agree to the deal and then double cross them."
: Oh fuck.
": No, but then we'll get a bad rating."
": Yeah, exactly."
: This way we secure our rating.
": Yeah, they can't give us a rating if we don't take job, right? they can't just randomly write a review."
: So we could– I like this! I think this is awesome.
: Then should we go with--
: We're doing this to defend Loose Duke? Everyone.
: We're doing--
: Everyone feels that strongly about Loose Duke.
: Hang on a second--
: We're not gonna make five thousand-
": Actually, we're on our own right now. We're we can ransom it back to Loose Duke or to this person. I have a feeling that it's spelled L O O S E. But I feel like it changes it a lot if it's spelled L U C E."
: D U K E versus D O O K.
: Interesting. How is it spelled in that?
: I'll tell you what.
": Yeah, how is it spelled?"
: I'll tell you what.
"Brennan: Both words. So it's ""Loose."" L O O S E and then duke. D U K E."
": Oh, okay. Yeah."
: So it's Loose Duke.
: So maybe this person's rad.
": So, but I personally,"
Ally: I send a nude.
Brennan: There's a long pause. And then you see
dot dot dot Hotbox420?
"Ally: Ah, fuck! How am I world famous?"
Brennan: Question mark.
: I actually really like Marge's idea though.
"Ally: Okay, but we don't have to go freewheeling like that. Do people just wanna take the money? Cause I've I've reinitiated the conversation. We have an in."
: I have a question.
: Yes.
: What if they hire somebody else for the job?
: True. And then we get there and it's us and another mercernary.
: I have to say...
: Also Loose Duke.
": I have to say, if they're reaching out, the Smash 'n Grab game was a, there was a lot of reaching out. Can we browse to see other Smash 'n Grab?"
": They were truly: the highest one was like 40, 400 credits."
: Can we google Loose Duke? Can we see what's up?
": Yeah, can we look up Loose Duke?"
"Brennan: Hell yeah. Give me an investigation check. And I'm gonna say if none of you have the criminal background or the, or the--"
Emily: I have Mercenary.
"Murph: Yeah, I have Watcher's Eye."
Brennan: So you guys can make this with advantage.
Lou: 20 on the geography check with regard to Jackalope Ridge.
: Cool.
: 24 on the investigation
check for Loose Duke.
"Brennan: You go (energy noise) and like your cybernetic eye projects a hologram and you see, there is a sort of 3D, it's almost like a GIF of a mug shot. You see--"
Emily: I think it comes outta my mouth.
"Brennan: You see a razor thin, extremely worried looking, like stubbly face, like short cropped hair, bunch of rings, bunch of tattoos, bunch of like glittered up teeth going like,"
"Loose Duke Hologram: Come on. man, come on, please."
"Brennan: And it just keeps repeating that ad nauseum, which is apparently what he was saying to whatever this like hologram mugshot is. And you see that, that's his, that's his quick sort of schematic."
Loose Duke Hologram: Come on man. Please.
"Riva: You know, I thought he was rad until he started begging, like those glittery teeth are really fun."
"Brennan: The rap sheet on him is a mile long, but you don't see any like violent crime on there. You don't see. It's like a lot of like theft, drug charges, petty larceny, auto theft… Stuff like that. Looks mostly a thief rather than like a hardcore killer. But his rap sheet is long enough that he- he's been in the game a long time. If that makes sense. So it's like as much, His like, his immediate vibe is this guy's a loser, but that's a long rap sheet. This guy's been working for a long time."
: He could be like-
: Seems like he should have died by now.
: Right.
: He could be a Hogg Cobb and there's Barry Nynes in his vicinity.
": Right, right, right. Exactly. Jackalope Ridge is a nice pace away. There's a reason they're looking for a starship crew to come get this. If you were doing this on skiffs, it would be like many days journey across the desert. Got it. Right."
: So that's why we needed to be fast. We needed to get there immediately.
: Needed to get there immediately. What'd you get on your geography?
: 20.
: What kind of information are you looking for on a 20?
": Terrain? Kind of more like honestly, topography. It's just like flat expanse. It's just--"
: Like a place we could like hide our ship.
: Mountainous.
": Extremely mountainous. And you see the area you're looking at has a lot of gun points focused on a, a set few number of ways into this sort of mountain range. Like very limited pathways. And you also see that there's not landing points for ships. Like you couldn't land there"
: it's too rocky to land anywhere in there.
: We'd have to board
": Just, is it possible that Loose Duke is trying to steal a ship and is putting out their own Smash 'n Grab?"
": That's what I'm saying. I think this is like a, I think this one is being kind of funky, which makes me feel like fuckin' them up."
": You guys, we have enough money, right? We're not hurting for 5,000 credits. So should we skip this one or should we get absolutely squirrely and do it, but not do Smash 'n Grab?"
Gunnie: I am never going to say no to money. Okay.
: You're right!
": We can load - We can load up on Plug jobs after this and get our rating back up, if we decide to betray this person."
: Plug might be dead tomorrow.
": I think that I actually, now that you mentioned ratings..."
": Plug jobs! I really think someone needs to, I think-"
: Just for the rating.
: Someone needs to do Plug jobs. just for the rating.
: Someone needs to go do the Plug jobs.
: Listen…
: Captain?
Skip: I think we should skip this one.
Zac: And I just start flying.
(laughter)
": Okay, all in favor of the $5.000 credit job on- through Jib-Job. Raise your hand."
: Through...?
: Smash 'n Grab.
: Sorry. Yeah. Through Smash 'n Grab.
: I'm just in favor of doing it.
": I was in favor of like of scoping it out and stealing, but I'm, I will go with the wind."
: I'm down to kind of feel it out and not give the package back to the person and get a bad rating and then do a bunch of shitty jobs and get a rating back up if necessary. We could fly over there and then see what the vibe is and then accept or deny the job once we're there. Right?
: They may not give us the...
"Ally: Yeah. Okay. Should I just accept it? I write back,"
Turns out our pilot has itchy fingers and wants to go fast. Is this is still available?
"Brennan: They hit you back. They hit you back and they say,"
We appreciate a woman who won't turn up her nose at some hard negotiation. Job's still on the table. Go ahead and click accept. And we'll tell you where the handoff and payout is.
Ally: Accept.
Brennan: You accept the job.
": Okay, Riva, if this goes bad, we need to get in there, and you use your psychic stuff to get them to put in a good review."
Riva: Absolutely. I'm all down for this.
: Where's the pickup? Where's the-?
"Brennan: So the job's listing you gotta go Jackalope Ridge and get this, get this package, the, the payout and drop off. So where you're supposed to take the package, Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket."
": Oh, oh, we're working for the sheriff."
: We are working for the sheriff.
: Sometimes...
: Can we hyper speed there and just do this fuckin' job?
": Let's do it. Are we, are we headed there right now? Is that, is that the plan?"
: Or sleep?
: Do we wanna do anything first?
"Lou: I mean, I've got some repairs to make to your stuff."
: Yeah. We've got a full day of stuff we wanted to get done tomorrow.
": Yeah. There's the junk yards, but I mean that, that, yeah."
": I'm also going to, if this goes bad, I can disarm the sheriff of his phone and then rate us on it."
: Okay. Yeah. We've got a bunch of great plans for the rating.
: Everyone's super concerned about the ratings.
: So should we just go there and try to knock this out in a few hours and then get sleep on the way back?
: Do we really wanna work for this guy?
: We already took the job.
: We took the job.
: We can decide whether or not this is a bad situation.
: Let's just go get this
thing and figure out what-
cuz we can look at it.
He's being so sketchy.
: It could be buncha too bad guys
and we get the box and the
box is awesome and we keep the box.
: Agreed. Let's go.
": Never forget, guys: The ball is rolling up. All right? This only goes well."
: I guess I'd just forgotten about...
": And we forget sometimes, you know?"
: Cool.
: Don't forget my shoes shoot bullets.
: Oh right. Yeah.
"Brennan: So middle of the night, you see Raymond looks up, he takes a pair of headphones off."
"Raymond: Hey, should I send a little message to the Jib-Jobbers? Or are we gonna be back in the nursery in, in time?"
: Back tomorrow.
": We'll be back. This is just overnight. Just, you know, wear earplugs to bed tonight."
Raymond: You got it.
"Brennan: You guys take off, you see little tortoises running up along the vents and the pipes."
: We got an infestation.
"Emily: They breed so quickly. I definitely wanna try and encourage them to mate so that Aurora's got, like a-"
: That's disgusting! I don't want that-
: I don't think you have to encourage them to mate. There's already three times the number.
: They were going at it in the bag.
: They were going at it in the bag.
Barry Syx: I could smell it.
: You're just holding a bag of mating tortoises.
: They were...they were going nuts.
: The fact that the smell is what alerted you and not any movement or sound.
Murph: Barrys have advantage on perception checks with smell. Barry has a very good sense of smell.
"Brennan: You guys take off flying through the night. You get out out from the sort of like smog pollution of Baustin and take off and you get under a clear desert sky. You see a face of the galaxy you've never seen before scintillating blue. And you see that these dunes out here, as you get away from all the skiff terrain, it's like hyper chopped up by skiffs and get to places that are just wind shaped. You see long curving side, winders of blue sand switchbacks, and ridge hills, and all sorts of terrain that scintillates with blue diamonds underneath a crescent moon. And you see the 80 foot tall cactuses out in the open desert Get up to a hundred, underneath you as The Wurst with just sort of minimal nighttime lighting."
"Siobhan: Can I send my psychic drone out onto the outside of the ship and just like, cling on."
: Yeah. You like hanging out.
Siobhan: Titanic it on the front.
: Yeah.
: Hell yes.
Lou: Can I make those repairs while we're traveling?
"Brennan: Hell yes. Give me, gimme your first repair check. What thing are you gonna try to repair first?"
"Lou: Oh, let's go for the...we'll start, I'll go for the, the fiber armor."
Brennan: Fiber armor.
Lou: I need to hit a DC 22.
"Brennan: You actually, I said it was a d4 up or down. It goes down by four, DC's 18."
Lou: Great. I get a plus nine to this.
Brennan: Okay. Nine or higher.
Emily: Can I give a help action?
"Brennan: Handy Annie can abs– Oh yeah, absolutely."
Lou: First one is a...
: Hell yeah.
(Emily shrieks)
Brennan: You have a set of fiber armor and you got it for steal. Fixer upper. Oh yeah. You like pry the magnet core out of there.
: I feel stronger...
"Lou: Good, good. All right. Let's keep it rolling. Yeah, I'll do the, yeah."
Brennan: You got time for one more.
"Lou: Yeah. Let me do the power belt or the, yeah, the Slugger. I'll do the power belt."
": Yeah, do the power belt."
: Cool.
"Brennan: The DC on that goes down on by four as well. So that's down to, Oh, that's like, yeah."
Lou: That's a 16.
"Brennan: 16 does it. Power belt is fixed, yes."
Emily: Can I also try and hack one of my grenades?
Brennan: Yeah. Go for it.
: Okay. I'm just gonna take an incendiary one.
: Mhm.
"Brennan: 16\. That fixes the grenade. Absolutely. I said, yeah, DC 15 on fixing those grenades."
"Brennan: Great, great. So you guys are flying. Pilot's got it under - Skip's got it under control. It's a short atmospheric flight, but you two, So you two are just in the workshop. Workshop is full to bursting with cool resources."
": Yes. The ball is rolling up. However, atmosphere flying is expensive. It's gonna be two up fuel units for there and back."
: Okay. Got it.
": You see erupting from the sand. Is this massive stony ridge that sort of like goes from like incredibly dune scaped open sand desert to suddenly very, very rocky. Right?"
": There's gonna be worms out here, aren't there?"
"Brennan: You head out and see this ridge. As you approach, Are you taking any stealth measures as you approach?"
": Oh, I think we're definitely doing that. Right? We're trying to get in as quietly as possible."
": Before we, before we land or anything, I'm gonna throw a grenade to see if there's like any, like Dune-style sand worms."
": Like, when we're far away? Not like when we're up close to where we're going?"
": I'm saying like, like at some point before we land."
": We're doing all this stealth shit, and you just throw a grenade?"
: Yeah yeah.
": As I make my stealth. As you're flying over the desert, you can actually, so you can throw a grenade if you want. Or you could just hit, hit the quad-hyon cannon whatever you want to do."
": I think I, yeah. Are people not worried about this?"
: I'm curious to see you shoot at the ground.
": Yeah, just shoot at the ground."
": Yeah, I'm just gonna shoot at the ground."
Brennan: Yeah. You have hours to get there. So you take a couple shots at the ground. Go ahead and give me a survival check.
": Can I get, can I help?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can give a help action here."
: 17.
Brennan: You pepper the blue desert sand here. You see the hyon beam sort of scorch the sand. You see there's like five or six little pock marks of now brilliant blue glass from where the lasers cooked the sand.
: Beautiful.
: Awesome.
: I'm gonna make that into a cutting board.
"Brennan: Doesn't look like there's any, any life here, you don't see any movement of any wildlife."
": Okay. I've dusted for sand worms, I think we're safe."
: Can I use my own stats with disadvantage?
: Yes. You can use your own stats with disadvantage.
: All right. So I have expertise in stealth. So that will be Nat 20!
: Yes!
: And a 19.
: Ohhhhh!
: Oh my god!
: Wow.
: Plus nine.
"Brennan: 28?! You guys all watch : you look up at the crescent moon. You look at the crescent moon and you dip the nose of the starship down, and memorize the next 150 miles of terrain just, and you dip the nose back up. You don't even need to look at it. You just have an understanding of how fast the ship is going, And you guys see that the Skip after you do that hyon blast, kills all the lights on the exterior of the ship. Can fly perfectly blind. You just, you know how fast you're going, you know where everything is."
: I'm holding my breath.
": It's very funny to me that before this, we were flying along illuminated like a beautiful architectural feature. It's like, you've gotta see this hot dog."
(laughter)
"Brennan: Incredible. So you go totally dark. And about like 40 miles from, from where the ridge starts, where it's like your last sort of landing spots, you actually kill the back thrusters and just glide in on like the mag hover. So you just like, it slows down. You know, it takes, it takes a little extra time, but you fully just the, you know, the, the noise of this ship is basically just (gentle hum) Like almost as silent as could be. (gentle hum) And you already are reinforced for ramming. So you, you know, if someone was within a couple hundred feet, it would make a lot of noise, but you come in for a soft landing on the sand that farther away than a couple hundred feet gonna be totally silent."
: So this is a kinda on foot mission?
"Brennan: There's no place to land deeper into the ridge. Cap, the Skip, has brought you guys in for like an ace pilot quiet landing, dead of night."
: Such a good roll.
": How, how loud is the scooter we stole?"
: Silent.
": Ah, yes."
": It is at, it has taken seven damage. I don't think we fixed it."
": Oh, it's a construct."
"So if you, if you could, yeah."
": Got you, bro. Yeah, I repair it."
: Hell yeah. For… Which one of you? I repair it for 11.
": That is no sweat. You're see this, like this took some very minor sort of damage to basically just its hull. It's like, yeah."
Emily: Can I like coo to Aurora and kind of be like right now we need to be quiet.
(menacing growl)
: Incredible.
": You see that, yeah."
: I was thinking The Rescuers Down Under : the lizard.
"Brennan: The lizard, Joanna. Yeah. You see that she is suspended on just her like claw tips on her front and back legs and is: she's not even moving her like elbows, just, just with her fingers, like low to the ground."
"Emily: She's up to the challenge. Before we go in, I am gonna cast buffer on myself just to give myself extra temporary hit points for an hour."
Brennan: Zortch and Ray look at everybody and ask if they should stay on the ship with Riva's body or not.
: Ooh. Yes.
Siobhan: Not a bad idea. I'm gonna cause battle pre-cognition on myself as well to up my AC to 15.
Lou: I'm also gonna walk over to Barry and touch his armor and infuse it and give you a...or no? Would you prefer weapon enhancement or armor enhancement?
"Murph: I'll take an armor enhancement, if you don't mind."
"Lou: Great, I juice Barry's armor a little bit. Rewire it. You've got one plus AC until the end of a, the next long rest."
"Brennan: You guys : it's full… You have that awesome silent landing into this blue sand cradle. And as you end there, it's you guys getting all suited up in the bay. You guys head out. You head : ooh, freezing cold night in the desert. As you begin to head up into the ridge, I'm gonna go ahead and ask for a group stealth check."
"Emily: Oh, I will cast Smuggle."
: Yes.
"And now Smuggle is basically pass without trace. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet has plus 10 bonus to stealth checks. And can't be tracked by- except by enhanced means."
Brennan: Okay. I'm gonna roll real quick here. Okay. The group as a whole needs to pass a DC 20. So on stealth.
: I got a 28.
: 28.
: 16.
: 18.
Zac: So I have a plus 19 to stealth right now. Yeah. And I got a nat one.
: Oh no.
: I am a second nat one.
: Oh God.
": Oh wait. No, no mine bumps up, I didn't even look at my stealth."
": I got a...okay, wait plus 10. So I'm plus 16. I got a 33."
: 33 from Sid.
: 16.
: 16.
: 18.
: 18.
": 16, 18, 33, nat 1, nat 1.. ."
: 28.
Brennan: 28\. Unless someone has any weird PC creep ways--
"Ally: Okay, I got an 18. I think I can..."
: You have Defiant?
": Oh, Defiant."
": Okay, you gotta hit a two. You hit a one, it's no dice."
(Ally groans in defeat)
: Goddammit.
Lou: Potent aptitude.
: Ooh!
: That automatically gets you to the DC.
: Zero?!
": Okay. So a lot of resources being spent, but you guys actually managed to clear that group stealth check. Woo, baby."
"Lou: If I'm gonna get a nat one, I have to do something."
": Oh wait, wait, can we say that, that time on the ship was a short rest also?"
"Brennan: Yes. That time when the ship was a short rest, absolutely. Well, except for anyone who was working. So you were working, you were working, not a short rest for you."
Zac: I didn't need it.
"Brennan: That's okay. Nor for the pilot who was piloting, but Margaret, Barry, and Riva, that's a short rest."
: I didn't need one so I'm good.
"Brennan: You all head up into the ridge. It's a good 50… It's a good 50 martrons, still dead of night. Thank God you guys passed that stealth check. You arrive at what is clearly an old desert… It looks like some sort of ancient desert monastery with some kind of semi-religious"
"looking dome with a large slit open in the outside, or like sort of opening. And you realize it's like a religious observatory. However, you also see that this place is ancient beyond, sort've, reckoning. And you see that there are a lot of like beer cans and garbage, kind of like rooted around out here. So it looks like some old ruins that like teens come out to, to get drunk."
: Can teens just read a fuckin' book for once? You know? I mean party somewhere else.
: Party somewhere else.
"Riva: When I was a teen, I partied and I read books. It's called multitasking."
: I shake a couple to see if there's any floaters.
": However,"
: Loose Duke?
: You also see...
": Floaters. You see, there is a cratered skiff, like one that got badly blasted. It clearly got like moved up here by something, cuz it couldn't have gotten up through the ridge. But it's like, looks like it took a lot of hyon beam fire during something, all around the rear back thrusters, so whoever was firing on this was firing as it was moving away. You see, there are a couple of makeshift turrets. Anti-aircraft/spacecraft turrets set up on the exterior of this place. You approach in the dead of night. As you approach you quickly tuck behind some cover because you see there is a little sort of whirring alarm camera, some kind of like sentry bot camera that is clearly like motion detecting."
": Should we try to shoot that camera? No, because if they-"
": I think they would notice if the camera just went dead. Oh, can you, can you do any tech tricks to it?"
: Can we hack it and have it just stay on the same frame?
"Emily: Oh, of course, I cast Off on it. Although if it goes away..."
: Then somebody will come check on it.
": Okay. What if I put, what if I put a minor hologram right in front of it that replicated the system?"
: You...okay. Awesome. You--
": I like look at what it's seeing, kinda get a vibe for it."
": It's just a loop of like a tumbleweed going across the sand or something. Well, maybe not that."
: You...
": So you create this like forced perspective hologram right in front of it. So it's like occupying a small space, but it's like a rendition of what the larger terrain was behind it. Whoop. You create it, you see it flickering into life and it's made of light. So there's sort of no motion detected. All of you guys walk past this thing into the monastery."
": Nice, nice. To see a bunch of portions, sort of around, like food scraps. What looks like some kind of setup communication system, a small like card table with some kind of dice game on it. And three sleeping individuals, all in sleeping bags. One of whom is Loose Duke. Right next to Loose Duke, handcuffed to him, is a like titanium briefcase."
: Nice.
: If I cast Disarm on that briefcase or like...
: Would it break his arm?
": Well, no, cause it didn't work when you disarmed whatsherface? So she had a chain on a gun."
: Yeah...
: But I guess I was wondering if I could disarm the handcuffs.
: Can I sleight of hand try to like...
: Oh yeah.
": But he's, he's surrounded by like soldiers or something, too?"
: All three of them are dead asleep. You see there's an alarm thing for their turret to go off.
: You do have pass without trace. You could potentially roll a super high stealth.
": Yeah, I mean like--"
: We could see if we could find the key if he has the key on him?
": Yeah. Can I just, like...?"
: Can I disarm him of the key?
: Can I search his pockets? Like...
": Give a stealth check, number one, and then give me sleight of hand."
: You can disarm him of an object
": But if it's carried, not worn, you have disadvantage."
: 30 Stealth.
: Incredible.
": So sick. You leap into the room silently. And as you get there, go ahead and give a sleight of hand."
: Goddammit.
Zac: Nat one.
": No, you didn't."
Zac: I reach in his nose.
"Brennan: Yeah. You go to searching his pockets. And as he does, he sort of starts to roll over in his sleep and embrace you in his sleep. And he sort of rolls partially on top of you and he nuzzles his head into your chest. You are kind of pinned underneath him now."
"Ally: Once again, can I roll for his sexuality?"
": What's the move now, Skip?"
"Zac: Skip is just gonna look at the rest of this crew. Just say, just be like..."
Do I kill him?
Emily: Can I disarm him of Skip?
Brennan: Afraid not.
"Murph: I'm gonna go over to the guys who are sleeping. Just point my gun at them and go,"
"Barry Syx: All right, fellas, wake up."
(Brennan laughs)
Emily: Alright. I point my gun at the guy spooning Skip.
"Brennan: Okay, cool. I'm gonna need a group intimidation check."
: You got it.
: All day. All day.
: Oh yeah.
: Goddammit.
Murph: A one.
: 22.
: Oh my God. What is happening?
Murph: I fart. I just loudly--
": I crit! I crit, baby!"
: Nat 20?
: 17.
: 17.
: 10.
: We crit in both directions.
: 22.
: 22.
: 13.
: 13.
: A 5 is what a nat one is for me.
": Cool. 5, nat 20 here,"
: 17.
: 17.
: 10\. So 17 is sort of the lower of the top three.
Emily: I also put my roller skate right on the little chain. That's that's attached to the thing. So he can't whip it away.
"Brennan: Cool. I'm going to roll in front of the board. We're kind of gonna do a little morale check for these guys. They only have a plus two to this, but that means on that They're gonna make their morale check on a 15 or higher."
: Dang.
: Somebody gotta die.
"Brennan: You see Loose Duke wakes up and says,"
": OH MAN, GET 'EM!"
Brennan: And everybody roll initiative.
: Now I got a nat one.
": All right, fellas."
: Oh my god. Five for me.
: 13.
Brennan: Anyone here get above a 12?
: Yeah.
": Yeah, 13."
"Brennan: Barry, Gunnie, Skip. Okay. Barry, Gunnie, and Skip, you're gonna act before these dudes do, you can all go right now."
Murph: Sweet.
We don't wanna kill you yet.
"Murph: And then I'm going to, I can't do like... Could I like set for stun? Do I have to, like, shoot these dudes? If I shoot these dudes with a gun, do they die? Is there like a laser thing--"
"Brennan: If you shoot them with a gun, they definitely die, yeah."
": Fuck me, man."
Murph: All right. I'm just gonna try to grapple one.
": Yeah, I mean like-"
: Cool!
Murph: I'll go into the zone.
: You go into the zone. Hell yeah.
Murph: Sunglasses. And I'm just gonna...
Siobhan: It's so dark in here.
Brennan: You just gotta beat the six on this athletics check.
": Okay, here we go."
: Woo!
Murph: Nat 20.
"Brennan: Whoo! Uh, yeah, you fully... You see a guy goes for a gun for like a gun next to his sleeping bag, and you just step on his wrist and put your other knee, like down on his butt and fold his legs up. And he sort of like pretzels under one of your arms."
Barry Syx: I didn't fart!
Brennan: Amazing. That's gonna be Skip and Gunnie.
"Zac: Since I'm already here, maybe I'll just try to grapple."
Brennan: Hell yeah. Give me an athletics check. You just gotta beat a 10.
: You're gonna move in the spoon to grapple.
: Whoo!
Zac: 19 on the die.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. So you're already embracing this dude. He stops. Gunnie, what are you doing?"
Lou: Gunnie's gonna do the same thing.
": Oh, oh, oh."
": Oh, Gunnie!"
Brennan: All right. I'll tell you what you gotta beat.
": Like this, Gunnie."
Brennan: You gotta beat a 17.
"Lou: Great. I have a minus two, which means..."
"Brennan: You have to get a nat 20. Or no, you get a 19 or 20."
: That's high.
Lou: That's only a 10.
"Brennan: Cool. You go, this guy sort've--"
(laughter as Lou mimics a bad grapple)
"Brennan: This guy goes, grabs a gun..."
: Oh my God...
Brennan: He grabs a gun and he's going to... gonna grapple you.
: Okay.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me an athletics check.
Lou: I got this.
Brennan: Athletics or acrobatics.
"Lou: This is, acrobatics I'll take, yeah. Oh, that's a dirty 20."
: Hey!
"Brennan: Cool, you evade him. He like wriggling away."
Gunnie: I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Everybody-
": Don't apologize, Gunnie!"
"Gunnie: I just, I thought we were grappling!"
"Brennan: Um, amazing. Give me another athletics check."
: Alright.
"Brennan: And you too, Zac?"
: 24.
: Cool.
: That is 11.
"Brennan: Cool. You manage to hold onto both your guys and that's gonna be Riva, Margaret, and Sid."
: I wanna shoot the chain that's attached to the briefcase to get it detached for me.
: Give me an attack roll.
: Okay.
": Oh, once per turn, I can do it with advantage. Okay. That is going to be a"
: Is this an attack against an enemy?
": No, I would not say this is an attack against an enemy."
: Okay. I got it. Okay. I got a seven on the die and I'm going to use a kinetic die to add to it.
: Nice!
": So 11 plus four, 15 damage."
": This thing has a hardness of 10 and five hit points, exactly 15... Blam!"
": And then I use psychic push-pull, pull it over and put my foot on top of it."
": Margaret, what's up?"
Ally: I would love to run to that comm center.
: Yeah.
"Ally: And try to find the log. And I would love to use my academic memory so I can like photographic memory, anything. And I'm really looking for stuff from Sheriff Warner Codge."
Brennan: Holy shit! Go ahead and gimme investigation with advantage.
": Okay, cool."
: Almost like we're a fucking well-oiled machine!
: With advantage?
": Yeah, with advantage."
": Wow, we rule."
"Barry Syx: Listen, fellas, we might be on your side, everyone just needs to relax!"
: Whoo!
Ally: 28!
: 28.
Ally: 19 on the die.
"Brennan: You scan through, (computer noise) immediately. Yeah. You scan all this, all these things. The most chilling threats you've ever seen in your life from Warner Codge, to this dude, being like, your family, your kin, your kin's kin, all in the fucking sand. Scrubbed out. Not a trace of dust anywhere in this galaxy. You bring that package here and now. And I'll give you the courtesy of a quick death, you fucking snake."
"Ally: Okay, So this guy, Loose Stool, is-"
: It's Loose Stool what?
Ally: Loose Duke is the person who was the courier that then decided to flip?
: Then decided to flip.
: Why didn't he say-
: I think can we talk to- not to kill him? Is there any info on there about like what's what it is or-
"Yeah, on that 28? Yeah, you guys see the thing goes away."
: Should we just like memorize this?
"Brennan: You grab that, as you're grabbing that, top of the order again, that's gonna be Skip, Barry and Gunnie again. What do you guys wanna do?"
Lou: I'm gonna reboot and turn off the alarm system.
: Hell yes. Great.
: Hmm!
"Brennan: Bloop! Their alarm system goes off. Brr. Skip and Barry, anything else?"
Murph: I guess I just wanna do some kind of an intimidation check or something?
Brennan: Yeah. Gimme another intimidation check. The situation has changed pretty dramatically Since the first time you guys did intimidation.
"Murph: Can I do it with, do I get it with advantage when I'm raging? I don't think so, right?"
"Brennan: No, I think it's just a straight roll."
: Come on.
": Whoo, baby..."
Murph: 21.
: Hell yes!
"Br: Oh, what do you say to this last dude who's still there?"
"Barry Syx: I know we woke you up. We might have fucked up and that might be our bad. I don't know yet. Everyone, relax! Relax?"
"Brennan: You see the guy next to Gunnie? Who watches Gunnie kill their alarm system. Just he's still got the pistol in his hand, but he goes to put pointing it up."
": Cool. All right. So here's the situation: We got hired to get this box, but we don't necessarily like the guy who asked us to get the box. We need to see what's in the box."
: Yeah. What's it mean to you and why do you-
: What's in the box!
": Ha, ha, ha!"
: What's in the box!
A: I'm wearing the perfect costume.
: What's in the box?
"Brennan: You see, Loose looks up at all of you and says,"
"Loose Duke: Come on, please, you gotta gimme that back. Please, please gimme the- gimme the-"
": You are not in a position to do anything other than tell us, we are trying to be on your side right now."
: We might give it back to you.
: You need to give us some information.
Loose Duke: I don't fucking know. I can't open it.
: Why did you-
": Why did you decide to steal you it, you fucking idiot?"
"Loose Duke: Because! Everything in the box, do you know how much money he makes off of that?"
": How much was he making off of it? Sheriff Codge, he can't come out here. It's outside his jurisdiction. He'll get nabbed by the Directorate."
: Who's the Directorate?
": The, the fucking Lone Star Directorate."
: Okay. So how much is he getting by having you come and get it?
"Loose Duke: I do all these runs every nargon. Okay? It's 200 credits a nargon and I had to do a run from New Dallas all the way to Baustin and it barely covers the fucking fuel cost, okay? The Directorate knows that that Codge is up to something and he, he makes a crazy salary working as Sheriff, so he tries to keep us on the low down. And I found out that he makes like a crazy amount. Like every one of these he's making like somewhere like five figures credits on, I'm getting paid 200 credits to ship 'em."
": Oh, no."
Emily: Okay. Can I use Handy Annie? And try to use my hacking kit on this?
Brennan: To open it?
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah. Go for it.
Emily: So I'm gonna get advantage from Handy Annie.
: Yeah.
: Okay.
: Okay!
": Okay, Baby."
: Okay...
: 26.
: 4 and a 19.
"Brennan: 26 to hack it open, you hit this little data lock on the outside of it… This thing is, briefcase was maybe underselling. This thing is a suitcase packed with brick after brick, after brick of Kublacaine."
: That's what I thought.
: Fascinating. Interesting.
Ally: How much can I roll to see how many thousands of credits this is probably worth with the markup that we already know is happening in town?
"Brennan: Yes, go ahead and give me a, I guess, give me, we'll call this like a finance check."
": Oh, great."
: Do you have advantage on this?
Brennan: You do. So this is intelligence plus expertise. So this is a plus nine.
": Okay, so... 13."
Riva: Okay. I have a nefarious plan.
: You have a nefarious plan?
"Riva: I have a nefarious plan where everybody comes out good. All right? Now the Sheriff wants you dead. And no matter what you do, you're a dead man. Unless we : very nice people : let you run away and fake your death, right?"
: Okay?
": Right, right?"
: But all that...
"Riva: No, no, no. 'Cause we can sweeten the deal for you is what I'm saying. We put your little dirty fingerprints all over the inside of this. We take two of these bricks out for us, making it look like you've stolen the Kublacaine, all right. And maybe you've already passed it on. You've already sold it. You see what I mean? You get it. You get it?"
: Hm mm.
"Riva: You run away. We have two bricks of Kublacaine and we sweeten the deal by giving you a cut. So you, you have some credits to run away with. That's more than the 200 credits that you would've made from this job."
: Okay?
R: Everybody's good.
: Right?
Sidney: Do you have family?
Loose Duke: Family?
Sidney: Yeah.
Loose Duke: These guys are my family.
Sidney: Great. So you don't. Okay.
Ally: How much is it worth?
Brennan: What did you roll on the die by the way?
Ally: I rolled a 13.
"Brennan: 13, hard to say out here, like on a core world where this stuff is like a little bit harder, it sounds you can be a little bit harder to, to come by or get marked up more. This guy said five figures. You just wanna look at weight of it. And you're like, I know what I pay for Kublacaine like at a party on like a core galaxy rec station. This is like six figures at retail. You could probably just drop the briefcase off to someone and clear middle five figures credits in like just, just handing it off wholesale to somebody."
": I know we're worried about our rating, but another plan on top of that plan, we smoke the Sheriff, and just keep it?"
": I was thinking that, if we can just get him away from his phone, we can give ourselves good rating."
": All right, someone, your put your foot on this guy's neck and let's have him make another Smash 'n Grab account and hire us, give us five stars-"
: Okay!
: to let him live. And then that'll balance out the zero.
"Murph: I feel like Loose Duke has already had, I'm starting to like Loose Duke, okay?"
: Yeah.
": If we kill the Sheriff, he won't even fit the review process. So we don't add another review at all."
: Do we get penalized for doing a job where we don't get a review?
: You do not get penalized for doing a job where you don't get a review.
"Brennan: Oh, all right."
": Okay, listen."
": Interesting. I take a photo, we take all of this shit out. I take a photo of the empty brief case and say we got here and this is all that we found. No people, either."
"Brennan: Margaret, actually, as you say that it occurs to you that there is nothing in the job because this Sheriff was trying so hard to make this happen. You're not, you didn't agree to return 10 bricks of Kublacaine to Sheriff Warner Codge."
: We didn't. We said we would return the package.
": The case, yeah."
: Let's fill it with space junk. Also so it has to weight-
: Has a weight to it.
": Also, is there a way for the Sheriff to figure out that we hacked into the case?"
: Can I like-?
: Let's just put sand in it.
: Yeah. Yeah.
Br: Give me another hacking check real quick.
: Okay.
": If we put sand though, he'll know that we did it."
: Ooh. Hacking is what?
: Hacking-
": Oh, Sid should do the hacking test."
"E: So, I do that, yeah, yeah."
: Cool.
: Nice!
": Handy Annie, gonna help me out?"
: Whoop! Woo.
": Okay, I got a 14."
Brennan: You look at the account grabbing you here. Like the account that gave you that had this job listing. Right? You look through it again and realize this account has never hired another job before.
: This is a burner account.
": Okay. Let's, should we, what do you guys think? We leave these people be?"
": Yeah, I think we'll lea- well also, didn't this thing specifically say not to kill the courier?"
Brennan: Said you didn't have to.
: Okay.
": Oh, okay."
": Oh, alright."
": Keep an eye out, Loose Duke. 'Cause I think this dude personally wants to murder you. Like we were told maybe not to do it."
"Loose Duke: All right, got you. Check this out, check it out. Here's an offer, okay? We split the Kublacaine 50/50. I couldn't open the case, right?"
: I push 'em down to the ground.
: I disarm the guy that has his hand up.
Barry Syx: Everyone be nice to Loose Duke!
: We get the hell outta here. We get the hell out of here.
Brennan: Big 180 on Loose Duke from from Barry Syx.
Murph: I never wanted to kill him!
": Something you were also aware of is again, the idea of like your ship has not begun any modifications process."
": Yeah, right."
: We're here with the plan.
: Should we just take the 5.000 credits and hand this insane thing over.
": I'm a hundred percent down to steal that Kublacaine. It was more just, you know, it's just adding another step of the process that we're gonna go ice this guy."
: I'm down to steal it. I am just worried that we are going to be in dock and doing modifications for at least another day. We have to make sure this Kublacaine is hidden.
: Okay.
: Can I-
: What about- What if we feed it to the dog?
": We also, all the Jib-Job people are back there. The Jib-Job people."
": Cool. You're right, you're right."
: Jib-Job!
: When is this job due?
": Yeah, when are we supposed to meet back up with him?"
": Like, I would imagine it's as soon as possible, we were just trying to get here right away."
": Right, but why don't we just go back and do our mods and then give it back?"
: Okay.
: Great.
: And just do a little bit of the Kublacaine.
": My friends, I'm telling you. I know what Kublacaine does for you. It's only good if you just snort it before a fight."
Barry Syx: I will say that Barry Battalion is against drugs except for steroids. Everyone needs to be really careful.
: Kublacaine’s kind of like steroids.
Barry Syx: Interesting. I'll have some.
"Brennan: Looks at you, Loose Duke says,"
Loose Duke: Here's an idea.
: Oh my God.
"Loose Duke: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no no no! This is good. Listen."
: How much of this have you taken?
Loose Duke: None. I couldn't open the case.
: So this is just your base vibe?
": This is just Loose Duke's vibe, everyone. Get on his level."
Loose Duke: Check it out. Check it out. The Sheriff knows that I suck.
: Right?
: Right.
"Loose Duke: Yeah. So if I opened the case, right, then I would probably steal some of the Kublacaine. And you could actually give me some of the Kublacaine, like I stole it. And if you guys came here and I blasted my way out and took like, if you guys have like a skiff or a scooter or something like that, and I like took off on it, then you could go and be like, ""Hey, we got the case. We can get the 5k and Loose Duke stole like half of it."
"Loose Duke: And then like, I'll just take a quarter of it. You take the other quarter and then, you know? Yeah. And, and..."
: You think he's gonna believe that you only took half of it?
: And that you shut us up?
": And we're gonna give you our scooter? No, that's a bad deal."
: What about your idiot friend?
: Yeah. I think we're good on Loose Duke.
": We're good on Loose Duke, we let Loose Duke..."
": Barry, stop standing with him."
: Come on.
Barry Syx: I thought he was gonna be part of the crew.
": Barry, come stand with us again."
: Do you need a Jib-Job?
Loose Duke: What's up? Oh really? You have a job for me. What's up?
": Oh, it's actually a workspace that you pay for"
: Where you pay us.
: What?
: I pay you to work for you?
: There might be good networking.
: Ooh
"Riva: You want to do a screenplay, or- Actually, if you'd be interested in being your own boss, there is a whole system in which you could."
Brennan makes a roll.
Loose Duke: [instantaneously] Sold.
"Riva: Excellent. Now, Pleasure Putty is this incredible-"
Brennan: All three of these guys just zone right in on Riva talking about Pleasure Putty.
Zac: Skip's gonna look outside and just make a perception check.
: Go for it.
: Yeah.
": Check out. Look, look for sandworms."
"Zac: Uh, 11."
Brennan: Sun's starting to rise a little bit.
"Ally: Let's get outta here. I have a thing right now. You know, I can just, I don't need as much sleep as I used to need. So if you can set up the the controls and like get us flying, maybe I can oversee it and everyone can get a long rest 'cause I can get one in like three hours."
: If you want to like slowly amble back to arrive closer to noon so everyone can get a long rest. That's totally fine.
: Oh yeah!
": Ooh, that's nice!"
": Final offer for Loose Duke, would you like to swap a magnet for one of your extensive pieces of jewelry?"
: Will you ferry us back to civilization-
: No.
: so that we're not trapped in the desert?
: No.
: What? Are we just gonna leave these guys?
: Why don't we just bring them back and hold them down?
: Bring 'em back.
: And just make sure they don't tell anyone.
: We tie 'em up in the ship somewhere.
": Oh yeah, in Marge's old apartment, maybe."
"Brennan: You got these three dudes hanging, hanging back and you see that all of them say, as you finish your spiel, they all say they're on board. They cannot afford the signup fee to join the even most basic Pleasure Putty package."
: That's pathetic.
: Okay...
"Brennan: So you guys arrived back in Baustin. You got the case, you're- it sounds like you're not doing mod stuff here. So the Chesters, when you get back, stay."
: Whoo!
: I have a question.
": Okay, yeah."
": I understand why we wouldn't want to do mod stuff here, but we keep running into just bad people everywhere. Should we just take a beat and try to get it done here before we do this, we meet the next Sheriff somewhere?"
: Let's go to the junkyard. We got big plans.
": Let's go to the junk, yeah, let's swing by the junk yard before we have-"
: Maybe we can at least grab the stuff and mod it somewhere else.
": Well, we were gonna hand it in and then maybe take 'em out. So why don't we just collect our reward and then we can decide if the time is right, we spring."
": All right, let's do that."
: You don't think he's gonna move that immediately?
: Do you think he's gonna get rid of all that?
: Yeah.
": You know the amount that even with Skiff Fest in town, he's not gonna be, he gets one of these re-ups every nargon it's like a, it's like a full month of stuff. So it's not gonna disappear in two days."
: Let's go do it. Let's go hand it off at the Lucky Bucket.
": Oh, oh Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket?"
: Sloppy Bucket.
"Brennan: So you guys roll up to Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket. You walk in, daytime is a very different vibe here."
: Yeah.
": Way quieter. And the place has a lot of Deputies around. You walk in and you see Sheriff Warner looks up and says,"
": Well, hey there, friends. If it isn't the Wurst."
Ally: And I give him the strongest handshake.
: Go ahead and give me persuasion?
: Okay… I'll do. Can I do like a perception to see what kind of weapons are around on him and his crew?
: Go for it.
: Nat 20.
: Hell yes.
": A pretty, these are not standard issue Deputies' weapons. These are some pretty souped up heavy blasters. Looks like a lot of them have grenades on them."
": All right, okay."
"Brennan: On an 11 persuasion, he looks up at you and goes,"
"Oh, hey there. Pleasure to meet you. So, happy to see you have the case here."
"You see that he motions one of his deputies over. deputy comes over, grabs the case, which I assume again, filled with the Kublacaine, takes it, see he punches in a code, opens up, he takes out a little vibrating sort of electricity switch blade."
Aah. Always nice to smell the real stuff.
"Closes it, hands it off to a deputy, looks up and says."
"Well, that's a job well done. It's always nice to go to the professionals. Grab and leave that there. Let me just go ahead and see your Proldier's Operating License."
"Emily: While this is happening, can I sleight of hand his phone?"
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a sleight of hand check.
Emily: Can I use Handy Annie to get advantage?
"Brennan: You can get advantage on the sleight of hand, but I'm gonna ask for a stealth roll for Handy Annie here, as Handy Annie like goes over to do it."
Emily: I don't know what her stats are. What is her stealth?
"Brennan: Oh, it's like a familiar, such as plus, I will say you see this burner phone in the Sheriff's hand and you see that clearly the reason he had like a zero rating, brand new account is just a burner thing. So he is got this burner like transponder in his hand."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: So you see, he says-"
Emily: I'm gonna see how this shakes out before I try and get that.
"Brennan: And you see it's got, so it's got Smash 'n Grab open on it. So he says,"
: If I can just see your your Proldier's Operating License.
Margaret: Of course.
Siobhan: Can I pull out just like a wallet and use hallucination on him and I'm gonna use heightened power to give him disadvantage on a wisdom saving throw.
"Brennan: So 'cause we have a lot of people making moves real quick, As he says Proldier's Operating License, This is AnarchEra. There is no galactic Proldier Operating License."
: Oh!
: No!
": In other words there is no, there's no central enforcing authority. So whatever he's talking about is local."
": Oh yeah, no he's trying to like not pay us."
: Yeah.
": Obviously. So we, yeah, think trying to hallucinate."
: Cool.
": But would that hallucinate? No, we're just not-"
": I don't know what it looks like, so maybe I won't do that 'cause that seems like-"
": Well, it doesn't matter, matter because he's trying to, like, swindle."
": He's not gonna be like, ""Oh, that's what it is."""
: How many guys are in here?
"Ally: We fucked up, we should have just fucking left-"
": Ah, so, there are probably about like a dozen or more visible that you can see in here."
: Can we communicate through eye contacts?
"Siobhan: You can actually talk to me psychically, and I can talk to everybody else."
"Ally: I say, ""Do we cut our losses and walk?"" to everyone? And I ask everyone to a nod yes or no."
": I think the dude's talking to us, right. So I think I'm just gonna say"
: Our license isn't up to date. The ad didn't mention anything.
": Oh, well that's a damn shame. So your license isn't up to date. Well, I'd be happy to do you do your solid and-"
: How much is the license?
": Well, normally it's about 3000 credits. Expedited, so they can cover this job. That'll be about 5.000 credit."
: Of course.
: That is so perfect.
: Can I cast buffer on myself?
: What's that then?
Siobhan: Oh yeah. I'm just gonna battle pre-cog.
: Excuse me...
": Oh where, oh?"
": Yeah, we're talking-"
": What do you think, Skip?"
Skip: I got my Proldier's license right here.
"Zac: Raise my foot up, put it on his head and I shoot him in the head."
"Brennan: Everybody, roll initiative!"
: Goddammit. That's all for this epi-
": NAT 20! Yeah, baby! That's all for this episode of ""Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey."" Tune in next week, as we have a showdown, at Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket. See ya in the stars!"

(upbeat music)
"Brennan: Hello one and all, welcome back to another thrilling episode of Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey. I'm your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan, with me as always are our Intrepid Heroes, say hi, Intrepid heroes."
": Hi, Intrepid Heroes."
"Brennan: Kissing those guns, and it's just in time, 'cause it's about to be a show down. Folks, last we left off our Intrepid Heroes had just arrived in Baustin, New Texas, with the whole bunch of plans to mod their ship, get some supplies and take some jobs on the old Smash 'n Grab. We met Lamelia Lafarve and her 10 Chesters, we met Plug from Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut."
Siobhan: Say it again!
"Brennan: We met from Plug from Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut and we also met Loose Duke, the-"
": I hate it, I hate it so much."
: When you get in touch with Ray tell him to kick that guy off.
"Brennan: I don't think I've ever had a wider spread of reactions to names than in this season here. It's truly like : Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut, yay."
Ally: Loose Duke gives me the idea of like the poop is too small and it's just kind of like rattling around and I don't like it.
": Yeah, for sure."
: You know when you use-
: It sounds like a rain stick.
"Brennan: I think, yeah, it's reverse ASMR for sure the opposite of ASMR."
: Ker-plunk.
"Brennan: And we became acquainted with the goings on of Sheriff Warner Codge. That's right, the Sheriff of Baustin."
": ""Sheriff."""
"Brennan: Sheriff, taking a job off of Smash 'n Grab for 5k to deliver a pa: shake down a courier and deliver a package. You delivered a case of Kublacaine here to Sheriff Codge,only for him to ask you for your proldier's license."
: Oh my God.
"Brennan: The Skip decided to say, ""here's your license,"" kick up one of his gun boots onto the Sheriff's shoulder, 'cause as we know these boots only ever shoot straight down, and initiative began. Combat has popped off. We are here at Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket, you've got a phone with an open Smash 'n Grab app on it and you have got a case of Kublacaine that has just changed hands. Holy moly, whatever are our Intrepid members of the Gunner Channel going to do? I'll tell you who's gonna decide that, it's gonna be Norman ""Skip"" Takamori. The time has come. kick"
Zac: My God. I'm gonna be talking for awhile.
"Brennan: Yes, as we know, you popped off and got violent. So you actually are gonna act while everybody else is surprised and then because you rolled a 24 initiative, I'm just gonna tell you right now, you're gonna act twice in a row."
: Yes.
": Yeah, baby."
: Yes.
: Full turns.
: Yeah baby.
": Full, full turns."
"Zac: Okay, amazing. I love this. Skip has had enough of this talking and it's just very clear to him that he must kill this idiot in front of him."
: Great.
"Zac: Kicks up my boot, slams it down on his shoulder, shooting straight down into him. I, from my Assassinate feature class feature for the Lethality Practice I have advantage on any creature that hasn't taken a turn of combat. Additionally, any hit you score against the teacher, creature is surprised. A creature that is surprised is a critical hit."
": Yeah, baby."
Zac: So. I'll just roll with advantage to see I hit initially.
"Brennan: You are going to roll with advantage to see if you hit. So yeah, this is your first attack, go ahead and roll."
"Zac: Okay, does a, what do I add to the boot actually?"
Brennan: The boot is gonna be just your dexterity.
"Zac: It's a plus five so it's with advantage, right?"
Brennan: That is correct.
Zac: Okay. Okay so does a 19 hit?
: A 19 against Sheriff Codge?
"Zac: Because I do, I can reroll one of these with my other feature."
": I said he's surprised, right?"
: Yes.
"Brennan: Hold on one, let me do a rules."
": Ah, can you cast Shield on a surprise round? I don't know if you can 'cause."
"Brennan: You cannot take a reaction, so because of that, a 19 hits."
: Okay.
: Incredible.
Zac: And I will roll since I have-
: Supreme accuracy.
"Zac: Supreme accuracy, I can just reroll one of my dice rolls when I have advantage?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Zac: And so just to see if I crit, well, I already crit so."
": Automatic crit, yes."
"Zac: So it's a D6 from the boot plus two D6 for sneak attack, which I'm doubling."
: Doubling.
: So it's six D6.
: Six D6 plus five.
": Yeah, definitely here you go."
: Okay.
: Here you go.
"Zac: Okay okay okay. So this is, oh actually here's the thing. Oh, I'm gonna not roll two of these D6s because as a lethality operative, I can use those two to make it a priming attack to put towards a new move on my next turn."
: Oh my God.
"Zac: So I don't have, I'm gonna only roll four D6 this time."
: Okay.
"Zac: So that's five, two… That is 17 damage on this first attack 'cause it's minus the two D6 and then, I'm also going to do my skills exploit Angled Perception on him right now."
: Okay.
"Zac: Which is not an attack or any action economy. So it's his, my perception versus his dexterity. He probably has good dexterity."
": Okay and angle, I believe that is the wording of that it's part of the attack action."
: Yes.
: So on. So is this happening on your next turn or is this happening.
: I would say it's on this turn to be used for the next turn.
": Copy that, okay."
": So I, for my perception, I rolled a 19."
: You beat his.
: Yes.
: So he has disadvantage on his next attack and disadvantage on his next saving throw.
: Oh.
: Jesus Christ.
: Okay.
: Incredible.
"Zac: So we've, that's basically this turn, except I'm going to bonus action try to hide behind him. That's the, that would be wrapping up the surprise round is me bonus action-"
Brennan: I will also point out because you would know that everyone here is surprised. Nobody here has reactions. So you have your full movement and nobody can take swings on you.
"Zac: Okay cool, I was just gonna hide to get advantage on my next attack."
"Brennan: That's fine with me in order to hide, I'm gonna need you to actually like use, sensibly use some form of concealment if you have it."
": Oh my God, use him."
"Zac: I'm going to, yeah you know, as a reaction, I can disengage through these people, even if they could have hit me."
: Yeah.
"Zac: And, and try to like hide behind this little wall behind him."
": Yeah, absolutely."
"Zac: So I will, yeah, right over there."
"Brennan: Cool so yeah go ahead and move your mini over to right over to here. Hell yes, okay so you- You know that this is still the very first round, everyone's surprised, and you dip out behind him, that's your attack. You've also hit him with a priming attack and he has disadvantage on a saving throw and attack on his next turn."
: Okay.
: Unreal.
"Zac: So that was all the surprise, my first round of combat."
"Brennan: Yes, now it is the second round of combat. Nobody is surprised, you still act first."
"Zac: Okay, great I have advantage on this priming attack. So it's a lethal strike, so his saving throw is 15 and the target can make a dex, constitution, or wisdom saving throw : my choice, I'm gonna say wisdom."
Brennan: Ooh hell yes. You want him to make a wisdom saving throw?
Zac: DC 15 and he has disadvantage.
": Yeah, he does."
: Amazing.
: A 16 and a five.
: Yeah.
: That fails.
": Okay, great."
: What a round.
: Oh.
"Zac: Now since I am hidden, I'm just gonna take yeah, a krystal dagger attack, throw a dagger at him."
: Hell yeah.
Zac: And this is with advantage because I was hiding.
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Zac: So I will roll that, that would be an 11 plus five or yeah, because I'm proficient."
Brennan: Yeah you're proficient in it.
"Zac: Okay so that was 18 for the first one we're just gonna see if I crit, nat 20."
(all cheering)
: You're kidding me.
: Oh my God you quadrupled those fuckin-
": So with the priming attack on a failed save, the next time you deal sneak attack damage against the target before the end of your next turn. You roll four additional sneak attack dice. So is that doubled?"
: Yes.
: So is the six then doubled?
: So that would be… so that's four?
": Plus already you have, so it's two normally."
: Yes.
: Another-
: Plus four.
": Plus four, so that's six. You're gonna roll two D4 plus 12 D6."
": Oh we gotta send our kids to camp, send our kids to camp."
: Send your kids to camp?
: Send my kids to camp.
"Murph: Send your kids to camp everybody. Bye, kids, have fun."
: Bye kids!
": 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,"
": Oh, you feel like Brennan?"
: Brennan what does it feel like?
: Plus two D4?
: Plus two D4 from the dagger.
": Zac, you're sick."
"Zac: I'm sick. All right, please die. There's so many dice that one of the die landed on top of another die."
: I think that counts as an extra crit.
: So that would be-
: Wow.
": Oh my God, so much math."
": You're praying for that crit, right?"
: Big time.
: And when he rolled the 11 the first time I was like oh come on.
": I knew we had supreme accuracy in our back pocket, so."
: That is so cool.
": That was, if we kill this big bad in one turn, it feels really good. It's like onion knight level."
: That would be 48 damage.
: There it is.
: On the second.
: So all in all you did.
: 17 plus 48.
: And before.
: Oh my God.
": Do you think he does have to kiss the crit, right?"
: Yeah kiss the dice.
: Kiss the freaking-
: Kiss the crit.
: Kiss the crit.
: Kiss the dice that fucked you.
": Here we go, a delicious chocolate box."
": Kiss the crit, kiss the crit."
": Just to get in there and kiss the, that was a real kiss."
: Delicious.
": Gosh, I'm gonna take off."
": You've done enough, you've done enough."
: Can my kids come home please?
": Okay that is, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe that is 65 damage in a single- well, two turns in a row."
: Yes and then-
: Yes!
: I'm just gonna jet pack up.
: There it is.
: Oh my God.
: I just wanna jet pack up and hide.
: Hide in the roof?
: In the rafters?
: Like a spider.
": You can rocket, let me just make sure that that is all kosher."
: I wasn't sure if that was outside of the map or not.
": That's exactly 30 feet. Yeah, yeah, yeah cool."
: And then yeah hide again up there.
": Hell yeah, go ahead and gimme a stealth check."
: What a round.
: Is he still standing?
: Nat one.
: Oh my God.
"Brennan: You can't, everyone knows. Everyone knows that's where you are. So to describe what just happened, Sheriff Codge was basically looking, looking at Margaret and saying like, “Here's how it's going to be."" You step up and say, ""Here's our proldier's license,"" full like ballet stretch your boot up onto his shoulder. No one, the barrel of the gun, but you're not sure where it is, no one sees anything. You hear a loud blam and ah, and as you see Skip somersault over this Sheriff, and as he takes his boot off a little fountain of blood pops out of just an open hole. It's like the boot was right here and just fired a hole straight down."
: Oh God.
"Brennan: Into his torso. You flip behind a wall dagger in the back and just jetpack up and are, have full total cover behind up in this corner, Sheriff Codge is still up. He has gone from completely uninjured to looking incredibly fucked up."
": Yeah I was gonna say he's still up, but he doesn't even want be."
: 60 something points of damage immediately.
: He wants to be down.
"Brennan: So that's Skip's turn, two Skip's turns in a row. Incredible, Skip shot first, we love it."
: I'm exhausted.
"Brennan: Unreal display of system mastery, Ally, that's gonna be Marge's turn."
": Okay I think that, can I try to see who, which of the deputies has the Kublacaine briefcase."
": Backwards hat to your right, the person directly in front of you."
": Okay that's good to know. I shout that out to everybody, and then I think I'm gonna have to use the disengage and run?"
: Cool.
: And slide underneath the bar.
: Hell yeah you wanna go underneath the bar?
": Or even over the bar like, and be with the bartenders. Can I make that?"
: Hell yes if you would like to do that.
: Rad.
: Classic.
: Classic.
: Yeah.
: I definitely had my eye on doing the same thing.
": Okay so first of all, okay, so you, you take disengage as an action. Go ahead and give me an athletics check, DC5 athletics check."
": Okay, 14 on the die."
"Brennan: Cool. So Margaret in your new life as a proldier, as a space mercenary, you see Skip blast this guy, dagger to the back and disappear up into the rafters of Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket, you turn around and vault over the bar."
": I say, I'm gonna take care of the Jib-Jobbers. I jump over and, and duck and hide and take out my phone."
": Hell yes, amazing. You very wisely, you have 19 hit points you dive behind the bar, incredible. Oh, it's a shootout, folks. Barry, that's gonna be you."
"Murph: Sweet, oh boy, okay, first things first Barry goes into the zone, puts on his big sunglasses. Hasn't had them on since yesterday. Then he's going to, I think fuck it."
: Hell yeah.
: Yeah.
M: I'm just going to do a burst on the Sheriff in hopes of hitting him and his two deputies right there. So they do dex saves.
"Brennan: Just to let you know, you are within five feet of an opponent. So you're gonna, they are gonna have advantage on this saving throw unless you move."
"M: Fine I'll back up a little bit, then."
"Brennan: Copy that, he's gonna get a swing on you, attack of opportunity. That is gonna be a miss, so guy gets a swing, you take five feet back, and are you more than five feet away, yes you are. Okay, cool. So you back up to right here. Go ahead. And oh, actually they're gonna make dexterity saves, right?"
: Yep.
: Hell yeah. What's your bonus to attack?
: Plus seven so it's should be DC 15.
": DC 15. Okay, Sheriff saves and the Lieutenant does not."
": Great, should be both guys, right?"
": Yes, both of them yeah, yeah."
": Both of them, sweet. Yes."
: Ooh.
: Nice.
: 17 damage to both those guys.
": Sorry, the Sheriff made his save."
": Got it, but aren't there, isn't there a dude with a hat right next to him."
": Oh, there is yeah. Let's make sure that you have the-"
": 'Cause it's a 10 foot, isn't it like a 10 foot cube?"
"Brennan: Oh yeah you can absolutely get 'em all. Although you're probably gonna want to be in that case over here so that you don't accidentally fire on Sid. Cool, okay you open fire on them all. Let's roll for that other guy, he also fails. How much damage did you to both those dudes?"
: What did I say? 17.
": 17 okay, both lieutenants take 17 points of damage. Incredible."
": Rad. And then I think I'm gonna use, I can't guard on this turn 'cause I've used an action and a bonus action, but I just want put some, I wanna put myself between Gunnie and danger. I wanna go right in front of Gunnie use the rest of my movement."
": Hell yeah, what side of Gunnie? 'Cause Gunnie's got enemies on either side."
": I think if I get right in front of him, it'll get in the way of the Sheriff and block some of these dudes on the side too."
: Cool.
: So I think that's the best option. So I'll just go right in front of him.
: Right in front of him.
: Yeah.
": Gotcha, copy that okay. Amazing you go into the zone, open fire. both those lieutenants. That is gonna be Riva."
": All right, can I do a quick little insight check to see who of these guys I think will be the most susceptible to a wisdom saving throw?"
": Yeah, gimme an insight check."
": That's a 22, no, I'm wrong 24."
: You scan their consciousnesses here. You would say that there is a very shallow curve upward from the officers to the two lieutenants or from the deputies to the two lieutenants to the Sheriff.
": Great, in which case I will, you know what? Fuck it, I'll take a little bit of a risk. So the guy to the left of the Sheriff here with the fun little, it's a very camp look, I'm enjoying it."
": Sandals, yeah, exactly yes, yes."
: So I'm gonna use Psychic Confusion against him and I'm gonna use Heightened Spell to make him have disadvantage on that saving throw.
: DC of your save is 15.
: 15.
": With disadvantage, that's a natural two, incredible."
": So the charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. So I will have him on my turn, which is right now, attack the Sheriff."
": Amazing and he is, he uses his reaction to do that."
: He already used his reaction.
": He used his reaction, he uses his action. The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns. Oh, so it's on it's turn."
": On his turn, cool, cool, cool."
": And then I'm gonna use, so I'm gonna use Quicken Spell to disarm the guy who's directly behind me."
: Okay.
": Or attempt to. So it's a strength or dexterity saving throw, whichever he would prefer."
": Copy that, and that's an at will, correct?"
: That's an at will.
: He successfully saves.
": Well, I tried."
"Brennan: There you go. Amazing, so you see this guy go like,"
": I don't much like when folks come into town and start trouble, that's why I'm gonna kick the Sheriff's ass."
"Brennan: And the Sheriff goes,"
"Sheriff: What? That's right, I know what I said."
"Brennan: Sid, that's gonna be you."
: Okay.
Brennan: Any movement from Riva? Sorry.
"S: No, I'm standing right next to a guy who can wallop me."
: Cool.
"Brennan: Sid, that's you."
"Emily: So the guy who just turned to go on that guy, does he have any grenades on him?"
": Which dude, the guy?"
: The guy who is-
: The Lieutenant Deputy two.
": Okay, uh Deputy Two. Yes he does to have grenades on him."
: Can- I'll do disarm on him to grab his grenade.
": Awesome, he makes a save. Fails the save."
: Great so what kind of grenade is it?
: Ion grenade.
"Emily: Ion grenade, okay great. Oh, and on my disarm, I use a kinetic die to add to my AC."
: Nice.
"Emily: Okay. So with the, with a stun grenade, I wanna try to target the guys who are over like right behind Siobhan's drone."
"Brennan: Gotcha, cool, cool."
"Emily: And I think with a 10 foot radius, I can target four of them."
Brennan: Yes I believe you should be able to do that.
: Right in the gravy boat.
": Yeah, I wanna throw it right in the gravy boat so everyone gets a little scalded."
": Amazing, okay. These are constitution saves, correct?"
: Yeah.
": Okay, here we go. They need to, and they need a 14, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
": The two, this is a stun grenade right?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Two in the back are fully stunned. The other two, the stun hits the back of their head, but does not, you know, blind and befuddle them. So two in front are not stunned, two in the back are stunned and unconscious."
"Emily: Okay and then with my reaction, I am going to throw another grenade because I took a feat that lets that I took my explosive style as a feat, so now I can throw a grenade as a reaction and I will throw the ion, throw a plasma grenade at these four, the two stunned and the two not stunned."
"Brennan: Okay two stunned automatically fail this save other two are gonna make their dex saves right now. And one succeeds, one fails."
: Okay so everyone who fails takes 14 damage.
": Nice, again."
: And then anyone who succeeds takes half that.
: Everyone who fails takes 14 damage.
"Emily: Yeah. Both of the stunned ones in the back and homeboy right here, blow up in a explosion of plasma. Knifey McGee is badly injured."
": And then can I, since I didn't use my full movement, can I hop over and join Margaret behind the bar?"
": You absolutely can. You can if you, gimme an athletics check, DC5."
": Okay DC5, I just need to not get a nat one."
: Zac is genuinely jealous of this dude who has a bunch of knives.
": I got a three baby, I got a seven."
": Cool, you and Margaret can both be fully like crouching. So you (grenades firing) yeah. It's honestly you like disarm from a Lieutenant and just keep the hot potato going. Bam, boom, and you jump over the bar. Sid and Margaret are behind the bar, Gunnie, that's gonna be you."
": Cool, I'm gonna hit the Sheriff with a Tracer Bolt."
: What does that do?
": It hits him, does four D6, and gives the next attack against him advantage."
: Beautiful.
: The next attack against him?
: Next attack against him.
: Have you gone yet?
: I did.
": Aw, that'll be a cool 23 to hit."
: 23 hits.
": A cool 23. Okay we'll do a cool four D6 damage. Those are low 8, 11, 12 points of damage."
: That's beautiful.
: That's great.
"Brennan: 12 points of damage to the Sheriff, you (gun firing) and lodge deep in his chest a little blinking tracer dart that is just like a homing beacon to all sorts of laser weaponry. Gunnie, that is your action."
": And then I'm gonna look over at Riva, pop a protective barrier out of my data pad and toss it onto them. So that'll give them...let's see, there's a d4. That's gonna give them four shielding against energy damage."
: Oh wow.
": I think it's just a fancy way of saying temporary HP, but of course but you have four points of shielding."
: Nice.
: Incredible.
Emily: I don't wanna jinx anything.
: Anything else from Gunnie?
": That's, I'll slide a little bit more in behind, behind Big Barry. So kind of really kind of close off the triangle."
Emily: Barry is walking cover.
: Yeah.
": Hell yes, actually correct. Amazing, that is, that is Gunnie, okay. Now a bunch of stuff's gonna happen."
: As expected.
": I am going to need, here we go, baby. We're gonna go."
"Emily: Look at that cone. Oh, this is so fucked because we can see what you're measuring right now. So we're just like anticipating."
: Don't come at us with these cones dude.
: Get these fucking cones out of here bro.
: Don't bring me a cone unless it has ice cream in it.
: Why is that cone growing?
": Riva, Gunnie, Barry, I'm gonna need constitution saving throws."
: Thrilled to do it.
: Nothing.
: Love making a constitution saving throw.
Emily: We have done Kublacaine without-
": Terrible, terrible."
: Really bad roll.
: Nat 20.
: I also got a nine.
": Nat 20 on the save, what'd you get?"
: Nine.
: Nine?
: Nine.
: It's tough to get a nat
: Look I almost got a nat one and then it jumped over at the last second so I'm counting my blessings.
": Mine was just a kind of, you know, an unceremonious four, it wasn't even close to anything."
": I like to think though that Gunnie got a nat 20, because he was standing behind you."
": Damn right I did, damn right I did."
: Rising tide lifts all boats.
: Exactly.
: Ball is rolling up hill.
: Gravy boats.
: Gravy boats. A rising tide of gravy.
: This like a prime rib restaurant as well as a bar?
: Incredible.
: I'd like to go to this restaurant.
: Oh that's waitstaff.
": So that is going to be, I'm gonna say on a nat"
: Yes it is.
: Thank God.
: Nat 20 we're gonna call-
: I am tucking behind Big Barry.
: Because Big Barry and Riva each take 36 points of cold damage.
": Oh, I am so down, I couldn't be more down."
Emily: We didn't apply med kits.
": Yeah my current hit points, even with the four, my hit points are 25."
: I believe does cold bypass the rage?
": Oh fuck, yeah."
"Brennan: Yeah. You both see that the Sheriff- badly injured, the Sheriff says,"
Sheriff: I'm gonna wipe the floor with you. We gonna put you in that Slop and Gravy pot.
Brennan: And-
": Oh no, did we eat people?"
"Brennan: And he goes to a, goes to a wrist launcher and this like flash freeze Freon burst. Riva, your droid fully ices out and locks in you hit zero and the droid ices out."
: I'm gonna take my reaction and try to heal up a little bit.
": Hell yeah, go for it."
": Skip, if you wanna kill this guy this time."
: Yeah I like look up at Skip in the corner just being like-
: You see like this.
": You hit four, hold on one second."
Lou: Where you at Big Barry?
: We need that freaking gun gone.
": Big Bar, what are you at?"
: 22.
: I need that for my stealth.
: Total?
: Total.
: Okay.
: Get that gun.
: Oh my God.
"Brennan: Okay you see him do that. He's longer than five feet away, he's gonna make an attack against Barry. Hold on one moment, here comes the attack against big Barry Syx. That's definitely gonna be a hit. Hold on one second."
": Which person? Or no I'm sorry, who's hitting you?"
"Brennan: The Sheriff, the Sheriff attacks twice."
": Of course he does, why wouldn't he?"
"Brennan: Nine plus four, 13 halved to six. You see, so he fires, hits you again. Hit something on his chest, a little belt, and he goes and fades out of view, as he begins to disappear in a sparkling, you see he goes,"
"Calling all deputies head to Swallop's right now, we got some out of towners we need to scrub!"
: Oh no.
: We need to fucking run.
: Again?
: No.
Brennan: Sheriff vanishes.
Murph: Does he look like he fully teleported or did he just go invisible?
Brennan: Anyone with line of sight give me a tech check. You do not have line of sight. Give me a tech with disadvantage.
: 'Cause I'm behind Barry.
: Yeah.
": I have full of cover, I wouldn't?"
": Disadvantage, if you want to make a check you do it with disadvantage."
: Does the tracer bolt help in any way?
: Yeah.
: What's that?
: The tracer bolt?
": Ooh don't roll with disadvantage, roll straight. You have a tracer bolt on it."
: That's only going to be a 10 still.
: 23.
: 23 from you? Technology check? Are you crouched by behind the bar for total cover?
": Oh yeah, should I do disadvantage?"
: Disadvantage.
": Oh, I can do it with disadvantage."
: Yeah.
: I only got a 10.
: 10.
: Yeah.
": Okay wait, I got two eighteens plus 7, 25."
": You, okay 25 for you, technology check?"
: Yeah I got two eighteens.
": Vanishes, you hear Gunnie's tracer bolt on an Android wavelength still in Swallop's, he teleported short range."
: Okay.
: Tactical teleport.
: He's still in here everyone he's still in here.
": Aw dang it! You, okay awesome."
": Barry, use your sense of smell."
: Barry!
: Yes!
: So that's just-
: I smell nothing but my own blood.
: So much gravy in here.
": Oh yeah if we could, let's throw gravy around and then if he's hidden, if he's invisible, we cover him in gravy."
": I also have a thing I can do, but I'm down so."
": Hold on one second. These guys stay partially put. This guy is gonna move over here, and this guy is going to move, gonna vault over the table, head over here. They're gonna take shots at Barry. One of-"
: God.
: We're not even heavy enough to carry Barry's body out here.
: Okay.
: Carry Barry.
: I can't believe we didn't get a med kit.
": That one also misses, but they began barking orders to their subordinates here."
": Med kit wouldn't have helped me anyway, I'm a drone."
: So this guy's gonna go over here.
: Oh can we repair you?
: Partial cover.
": Of course we can. Everybody's gonna be okay, we can do this. We're gonna murder these people."
: Yeah.
: Yeah.
": We're murder hobos, remember?"
": Exactly come on, we've already killed two of them, there's so much more murder we can do."
: No we killed three of them. Three of them lost to the lost their lives to grenades.
": To grenades, and more will follow. A pattern has been set."
: All right. Five attacks incoming at Barry.
: What?
: Goddamn.
: There's nothing I can do.
: I guess that's what I get for fully hiding.
: Okay five attacks incoming for Barry.
: I know that's I'm like a little bit like shit maybe I shouldn't have hidden. I could shared some of this damage.
": Although Gunnie is there they're all going, they're all shooting Barry 'cause he's the big he's he's who you take down, you know?"
": Yeah, he does look terrifying."
": Yeah, he's got all those big ass guns."
": 14 halved to seven, 10 halved to five."
": 14, okay, so 12."
: 12.
: I'm at four.
": Barry yeah, Barry's standing completely isolated, middle of the room, zero cover, these guys just open up and you can see their, their commanders are barking out orders. That is the end of the bad guys' turn. That is the end of the Sheriff's department turn."
: Oh my gosh.
: But didn't he call in fricking back up?
: He did.
: Yeah he did.
: So this is why I'm like worried.
: We gotta get rid of these guys and get outta here.
": Skip, that's gonna be you."
: Can I make a perception check again? Just to see if I see where the Sheriff is or?
: I'm gonna make a stealth check.
: Okay.
: I'm gonna make a stealth check for the Sheriff right now.
: Yeah you would have the best view of all of us.
: Yeah like I'm just trying to see if I see any tracks of blood and gravy on the ground.
": Okay it's a DC, I will let you know, you will know if you fail it. It's a DC 23 you're trying to beat on a perception check."
": Okay. Yeah I got a 17. There's no way I can boost, I can roll my d4, but I don't think I have another way."
: Defiant?
: Yeah but that doesn't take me to a 23. There's no other.
: So.
: Yeah so.
": In that case Cap or Skip, I should say, it's full leap of faith. You'd have to fly and you know, you see the layout of the place here, you know he's somewhere here but."
": I think I don't, I just it's because I have no idea. I'm just gonna go for this Lieutenant below me."
: Cool.
: And just try to take him out.
": Yeah, I think that's a good call."
: I'm gonna leap down to this table in front of the fish and do just a sneak attack.
": You are not attacking from hiding, they know you're up there."
": Oh yeah, yeah."
: So you'd have to use your bonus action try to hide again.
: I'll do a bonus action hide first.
": Cool, let's get that stealth."
: Nat 20.
: Hell yeah.
": Land on that table and sneak. So this would just be just a regular sneak attack attack. So let's see if I crit 'cause that would be great, I have advantage 'cause I'm hiding, right?"
: Yes that's correct you roll with advantage.
: Eight.
: Crit city.
": Because I have that feat supreme accuracy, I rolled three, I rolled a 13 plus seven, so 20."
: 20's gonna do it.
": Okay so that's just two D6 plus, and I'm using the, it was a, what do you wanna call this, sorry, just it was a vibro-rapier?"
: Yes. Yes. So just a krystal dagger yeah.
": Okay so I'll use the krystal dagger, which is that okay? That's a D8?"
": Yes for sure, yeah, yeah, yeah."
": So I'm gonna use that attack. So it's a D8 plus two D6, six, five, three, so that's 14 plus five damage, so 19 damage."
": 19 damage to the Lieutenant in front of you, Lieutenant looking badly injured."
: Okay and then I'm just gonna go (snarls) and just sort of take a step back into this corner.
": Hell yes, he'll get a swing on you 'cause you're just you close to melee."
": Reaction disengage, take a step back into that corner."
": Done deal, all right."
: Just in case there's any-
": You're gonna get some cover from people on this side of that wall. Yeah, Margaret that's you."
: Okay I would like to look at Big Barry Syx and all the damage he just took and hone my Critical Analysis on him.
: Okay.
": Like dip up, look at that."
: Cool.
": So that's just, you get to add a plus five to an attack roll, ability check or saving throw your choice."
": Oh yes, appreciate you."
": And then I, this feels so stupid 'cause this is so critical, but I'm going to send out a Jib-Job message."
: Hell yeah.
": Telling everyone to get back immediately, it's a hot exit."
": Hell yes. Real quick, Murph, would you do us the honors and roll a luck check for the hot exit?"
": Guaranteed nat 20, that's a seven."
": Okay, copy that, you hear back from Raymond, copy that. Barry, that's you."
": All right, Barry's gonna, Barry's seeing red here. He's gonna sniff the air try to find the Sheriff."
": Yeah, he is."
: Gonna try to find him.
: Heightened sense of smell.
: It's the same DC for Skip it's 23.
: Okay do you have a die?
: I literally can't hit that.
: Do you have advantage on the roll for smell?
: Yeah.
: You have two chances to hit a nat 20.
: Okay.
: Nope.
": Cool, can't smell, it smells like Slop and Gravy in here."
": Oh all right whelp, okay. this one dude over by Skip is pretty hurt, right?"
: Yes.
": All right. I'm just going to take, I got these, is this knife dude still alive that's on the ground here looking weird."
": He's a dinkier guy, right? That that's like a regular side."
: I believe knife dude is done-zo.
: He's already dead.
": Yeah, yeah."
": Okay I'm trying to think if, I should burst two guys or just try to take out the one."
: Ooh.
": Well the one guy is a, like a Lieutenant."
: Lieutenant so maybe I'll just go for him.
: I don't really know what the difference is.
: I'll take an attack.
": Yeah 'cause they had a morale roll at some point, right?"
": No, that was those people that we."
: That was Loose Duke and his two buddies.
: Loose Duke.
: And Loose Duke apparently runs a tight ship and keeps his employees happy.
: I'm gonna lightbow attack on this-
: Dude right in front of you?
": Dude right in front of me, yeah."
: Cool.
: 17 to hit.
: 17 Hits.
": Great. Just gonna reroll that two and I got one instead, that is 13 damage."
"Brennan: Skip, you land down from the roof jump with your jet pack. boom stab this guy, he turns around and says, ""Don't you ever learn nothing, I'm gonna-"" and his face explodes forward in blood as a laser from Barry's assault blaster kills him. The Lieutenant is down."
": Oh my God, grab that huge gun."
"M: Now Barry, he needs get the fuck outta here. He's truly so hurt and he can't do his regeneration thing if the shot would take him down to zero so literally next shot I'm gone."
: Yeah.
"M: So I'm going to, I also have a lot of movement 'cause I also have a bonus action thing that lets me jump 30 feet."
": Murph, just jump out of the fucking restaurant then, you can't literally can't take a hit."
Zac: Can you jump to that cover that I was at earlier?
: Oh yeah.
": That's 30 feet straight up, you could leap up into the rafters."
Murph: I'm gonna leap up into the rafters.
: Oh my God. He's so big and he's so nimble.
: Incredible.
": So many spiders, the waitstaff never gets up there."
: Appreciate you.
: There's a bunch of spiders coming outta Skip's mouth.
: Oh no.
: Why did you eat those?
: I don't know I got scared.
"Brennan: All right, Barry you tuck up into the corner and you are good to go. Great you are up there with total cover. So you guys see Barry leap, boom - hit up to one of upper corners of Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket. Riva, you are frozen. Now..."
Siobhan: Right.
"Brennan: I'm gonna say this: actually part of the condition that you were hit by, your drone is when it drops to zero, actually doesn't have to make death saves."
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: You can but this is sort of an imprisoning thing. So it would be like locking your consciousness into the drone.
: Got it.
": If you want to have the opportunity to pop out of it, it would also mean that you are actually making conventional death saves for the real Riva back on the ship."
": Right, is there any way for Gunnie to unfreeze me?"
: You believe there is.
: In which case the smart thing to do is?
: To probably hold tight and wait for yourself to wait for the drone to be unfrozen by whatever that blast was.
: Yeah.
: All right.
": Do I, do I roll a saving throw to unfreeze myself?"
": There's no saving throw, because you got dropped to zero."
: Right.
": But it's basically like, do you wanna start the process of making death saves on the one in 20 chance you pop back up or do you want to hold tight with the opportunity that someone else could fix you and get you back up?"
: How far away is the ship?
": Oh, quite far, you guys are way off in town."
: In which case I think it's the better option to wait.
: Cool.
": If we were close, I would maybe make the risk and grab the dog and come in on a full like-"
": Yeah, exactly."
: Cowboy mission.
: You can like use your turn though to help Raymond somehow.
": I'm down, I mean, there's nothing I can do so I would be-"
: Cut to the Wurst where Riva is contorting on the bridge as their consciousness is trapped inside of the cyborg.
: Gotcha gotcha.
": Sid, that's gonna be you."
": Okay, so if I wanted to throw a grenade at this guy, would the perception check to find him be less Because I'm looking for, I have like a 10 foot radius."
: You had a technology check so you know that he's still in here.
": I did, yeah."
": It's a perception check 'cause you're just looking for a 10 foot radius, right?"
: Yeah.
: I will go ahead and say you can roll perception with advantage because you're just looking for an area.
: Okay.
: Hell yeah.
": Come on baby, come on baby."
": Still trying to beat the same number, 23."
": Oh so I do have, I do have to crit."
": We love it, we love it, we love the challenge."
": I did not. Okay I'm going to first I'm going to, I'm gonna try to 'cause I am within 30 feet of backwards hat guy who has our briefcase."
: Yes.
: And I wanna disarm him to take the briefcase back.
": Yeah, I dig it cool, cool. You move to the edge of the bar. He's gonna roll a saving throw to avoid getting disarmed and this is you trying to disarm him of the briefcase?"
": Of the briefcase, I want the briefcase back."
"Brennan: This is certainly Box of Doom, for sure. Amazing gonna add a plus one to this. The DC is 15, 14 or higher he holds on. Sidney, magnet stands he looks and says,"
What the hell!
Brennan: And it releases from his grasp and you are holding a lot of credits in your hand.
: I pass it to Margaret.
": Perfect, I keep doing what I'm doing."
": And then I think I'm just gonna throw grenades at these two, are you concerned about that? You needed?"
": Oh, I wasn't sure what disarm was in your action economy I was kind of like."
": Oh, it's, it's an action, but I throw, I can throw grenades as an action, a bonus action, or a reaction. So I'm just gonna throw two grenade fragmentations at the guy I just disarmed and the person he's next to, or actually I'm just gonna throw one let's see how that plays out."
": Cool, copy that. They're making dexterity saving throws I believe, correct?"
: Yeah.
: They both fail.
: Yes!
: Okay so...nine. So they each take 15 damage.
": The officer goes down, Lieutenant badly injured."
Emily: And then fuck it. Do I just throw another grenade at him?
: You gotta get rid of him.
Emily: I throw another fucking grenade at him.
: Yeah.
: Another grenade fragmentation.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, roll damage first."
Emily: 10.
"Brennan: It's possible for him to still be alive on a save, but he would need to roll higher than a four, both lieutenants down. Okay so down, yeah. Both of these, both of these people gone over here, this gravy bucket is exploding and full of lasers, just Sidney and Barry and all of these officers firing left and right."
: Oh and I'll also expend a technology to boost my AC to 19 now for this round.
: Woo.
": Hell yes. Cool so for everyone here to know, we have one remaining Baustin, New Texas Sheriff's department over crouching behind this table here, good looking out on those grenades by the way, 'cause all these people had lots of cover."
: Yeah.
: Wow.
: So grenades were absolutely the move here. You got two over here as well and one crouched on the other side of the bar right here.
": Right, plus the Sheriff's fucking somewhere."
: Yeah wherever the Sheriff is.
": Very clean Sheriff, who had a bath just this morning smells like nothing or he's just been bathing in gravy so he smells like-"
": Bing bing bing, there you go. Gunnie that's gonna be you."
": Oh, okay what's going on with Riva? And is there anything I can do about it?"
: So here's the deal.
": Zac, you're a genius, Zac you're a genius. Zac, you're a freaky little genius."
: Little sneaky little genius.
: That's such a fun idea.
"Brennan: You know that this effect will if no one deals any further damage to Riva's psychodrone, this effect will wear off in about a marbec. However, if you wanted to get Riva back up and running right now, it is possible to do that. It would be whatever you use to normally heal drone damage but because of how powerful this effect is, you would also need to accompany that with a DC 30 mechanics check."
: What do you add to mechanics?
": I add nine so we'd have to, even then I'd have to crit."
: Yeah so that's just a crit.
": Maybe it's not worth spending your time and your turn on, on such low odds maybe it's just a better idea to just like throw me over your shoulder and get behind cover."
"L: Oh I'm the wrong guy, how heavy is the drone?"
: Do you have a way to heal Barry?
: Oh yeah.
: Yeah you should heal Barry that's the- but Barry's up in the rafters.
: With total cover.
": Well, I have a jet pack."
": There you go, incredible."
: Can I carry Riva?
: Give me an athletics check.
: Okay.
: We're gonna call this a DC 10 athletics check.
": All right all I needs a 12, and I got an eight and with my minus two."
": Object interaction, you lean down and the drone will not come up."
": Riva, I'm sorry, just talking into a quiet face, I'm gonna use a bonus action to turn on my jet pack and fly up high enough as little as I need to, to be able to see Barry."
": Hell yes, hold on one second. You're gonna go up."
: Much appreciated.
: How much would it be to fly to Barry?
: Movement?
: Yeah.
: Let's find out.
": No, I'm gonna take, I'll take the 15, I'm gonna, I'm gonna pop out another, not barrier, but med pack and just chuck it at Barry and we'll cast it at a second level. So we'll heal him for two D4, three, five, ten hit points."
: Nice.
: My hero.
: And then I'll jet down to where the lieutenants were that Sid took out or as much of that as I can with 30 feet of movement.
": Cool, you have 15 feet straight up and then you scoot down here and get about that far."
: Great.
": Jet packing away. Okay that is Gunnie's turn. Gonna be our bad guys again, I'm afraid"
: There's not that many.
: There's four.
: Well unless the other guys turn up.
: The four.
: And the sheriff.
: But it's not his turn.
: At this point we have the briefcase. We should just get outta here.
: We should get get the phone.
: But now I'm on team murder this guy.
": You're right, we can't, we will literally make so much less money if we get a bad review, you're totally right."
": Once we, yeah once we get him."
: What about the Jib-Jobbers? What are they at?
: Oh has he rolled for it again?
: God.
": Hold on one second. All right, everyone behind the counter's got total cover, right?"
: Yeah.
: Okay first thing's first the Sheriff is going to go.
: Reveal yourself Sheriff.
": Sheriff teleported into the kitchen and steps to the counter. Sheriff's going to leap out, leap to the top of the bar here, and he's gonna hit Mar- he's gonna hit Sid and Margaret with his cone effect. We need constitution saving throws from Sid and Margaret."
": I need to do well here, I really need to do well here, I will go down I bet."
: You hate to see it.
: Just for the audience at home we haven't created secondary characters.
: Yeah.
: That's a six for me.
: Okay okay that's an 18.
: 18's gonna make the save.
: Four.
: I mean it's still.
: So what was yours?
: Six there's like no way to.
": 22, 23, 32."
": I look at Marge and I just say,"
Sid: Don't let them scrap me for parts.
"Marg: I would never, I would never."
: 35 damage to Sid and that's gonna be-
: Sid's down.
: And that's gonna be
": Wait, I'm not because of my 10 extra hit points."
: Oh my God.
": Wait, why do you have those again?"
: Because I have a spell called buffer that gives me 10 extra hit points.
: That you cast as we were just sitting there.
": Okay so the 17 damage to Margaret and 35 damage to Sid, cold, neither of you dropped, same sort of like Freon blast, neither of you go down, correct?"
": Correct, I have two hit points."
: Okay.
: Oh my God.
: The Sheriff is going to fire on Sid with-
: I do not have a reaction.
: But you have partial cover right?
": I still have some kind of cover and my ACs currently 19 'cause of my kinetic die. So if cover adds anything to that. Come on fucking miss, fucking absolutely miss."
": Pings off of your cannons, Sid is still up. He goes, ""Goddamn Interlopers,"" and once again disappears from view."
: Yes.
": Hate that, okay there're not many places he could've gone. He went in the kitchen."
": Yeah it's like when you're playing hide and go seek, but you're it's like a one bedroom apartment you know?"
: Exactly he's either in it corner the kitchen or he is in the bathroom shitting himself.
: Okay.
: That's why there's so much shit on the floor 'cause the Sheriff keeps shitting himself inside.
: Classic shit.
: Can we animate that please.
": I'm just hanging out, can we please? TaleSpire, can we just animate the Sheriff shitting himself?"
: I guess up close maybe not.
: As like a live Shrek.
: Okay and then two attacks against Gunnie.
: Shield.
: Both attacks miss.
: [Ally] Yes okay good god.
": And then one against Norm or once against Skip, misses Skip, that's the bad guys turn. Holy shit, let's go around and get some HP totals real quick. Barry, how we doing?"
: 14.
: Eight.
: Two.
: Uninjured.
: Down.
: Uninjured.
"Brennan: Okay, the Sheriff Warner Codge, that crooked old Sheriff of Baustin, New Texas unloads with an attack that should bring Margaret and Sid low and instead leaves them up and misses with the blaster rifle, teleports once again with a new stealth roll, we're gonna change that 23 to something else right now."
: Oh my God.
: Give me a bad one.
: I'm actually a Divination Sentinel so they actually got a one.
: Okay. There is a new total for perception checks here.
: Well I don't know if anyone's gonna make a perception check. We're gonna go back to the top of the initiative order with Skip.
": Skip okay, knows that this guy's he's started to learn this guy's tricks and so he's going to yell Margaret, Margaret."
: Yes. I poke out.
: With the thing in your hand can you make his thing make a noise?
: I know exactly what you're talking about and I open up Smash 'n Grab and I just start pinging him.
": Yeah and I'm just wanna like, hold my turn for Margaret's turn to do that."
": Cool, cool."
: Could we do that?
: No roll needed.
": You know this guy has sound on, you know he's not on do not disturb."
: In the movies he's got his volume fully up.
": We wait okay. You're gonna send your turn, Marge goes right after you Margaret it's your turn. What would you like to do?"
: I ping I send all of those pings.
: What do you say? Get nasty.
: Yeah what do you say on Smash 'n Grab?
: Yeah what do I say? I think it's just like-
: Get nasty.
": It's quick yeah, I just keep writing get nasty, get nasty, get nasty."
": Oh Marge, I was saying you should get nasty."
": Look I'm not sure I just went with it, I didn't, I wanted to say no bad ideas, blue skies period. I just write Sid says get nasty, Sid says get nasty."
": No, I was telling you to get nasty. I don't wanna get nasty with this fuck."
": So you start spamming boom. Boom, boom, boom. No roll necessary right outside if you look where my flashlight is, he teleported to the outdoor bar on the other side of the plate glass window, and you hear coming from behind that counter a noise going-"
(La Cucaracha music playing)
": Wait, is that Margaret, can you also open that window?"
": Cool, and so Margaret that's your action, any other actions from you or no?"
: Can I like open up the window to give like line of...
": Oh yeah, do you want to, if you wanna just make like a blaster pistol attack, go for it."
": Yeah perfect, okay."
: Nat one.
: Nat one.
": Bad dice roll, bad rolling of the dice."
: Margaret tried to shoot her cell phone.
: It's so quickly landed on the one.
: You reach into your little like business wallet and just hurl your pistol across the room.
": For sure, for sure."
": For sure, for sure."
": Can I, yeah anyway, nevermind. I can't bonus action anything okay."
: You sure?
": No I wanna keep my critical analysis on Barry, so."
": Cool, cool, cool. Copy that. Alright, Skip that's your turn."
: Skip wants to run full bonus action dash through and try to dash and just jump through the window. Hell yes to get line of sight on this guy.
: Hell yes okay.
: Jump through the gravy so you're like real slick.
": Yeah, sliding across I wanna slide across the bar and jet pack so."
: Covered in gravy.
: So I'm covered in gravy and jet fuel as I blast out of the window.
": Oh yeah so your movement with the jet pack is 40, I believe, right?"
: Yes so 40.
: 80 Feet is more than enough to get you out through there.
": And then yeah, just roll out. I still believe that there's advantage because of the tracer bolt that we haven't used yet."
: Absolutely correct. Go ahead and give me an acrobatics check if you'd be so kind.
: Okay got a pretty good acrobatics. That is a 13.
: 13 okay. You take four points of damage going through the plate glass.
: But now is it open now?
": Now it is open correct. So you guys see Skip takes off, you, and just zoom out of the bar, smash through the plate glass. You smash the plate glass and you are bam outside, you can be wherever you want. You can be standing on the bar you can be standing on the stools, but the Sheriff is right there."
": Yeah definitely wanna like land around there, but I think it's still like a slow motion."
: Oh hell yeah. Go ahead and give me an attack roll with advantage.
: Okay.
: You've got this!
": This would be sneak attack because I have advantage, right?"
": Yes, yes."
: Correct.
": And then because I have supreme accuracy, I get to reroll one of those. Okay so I rolled a 20, it was a 17 on the die plus seven so 24."
: You explode through the plate glass window sideways blaster going.
: Get nasty.
": The Sheriff turns, whips up his energy shield."
: Fuck you. Not fast enough.
": Oh, it's a D6 'cause it's a blaster."
: I would like to Targeted Attack with him so by looking at him.
": Whoa, what does targeted attack do?"
": When an ally makes an attack against a creature, you can use your reaction to expend a D4 and add it to the attack roll and the damage roll if it hits."
: Hell yes.
: Hell yeah you wanna roll it?
": Yeah, sure, that's a three."
: So 18 damage from me plus the three.
: 21.
": Come on, come on, come on, big money, big money, big money."
: Do you see that number right there?
: No way.
": That is a twenty fucking one, that is a twenty fucking one baby."
": You know how annoying it would've been if he would've been like, ""he is really fucked up""."
: I hate it when he says that.
": Right laser to the throat right on Gunnie's right on Gunnie's tracer bolt. Margaret, you yell out that last moment through the glass. Boom! Skip, Sheriff Codge hears you say ""get nasty,"" and his throat explodes out, he follows orders, and his purple cowboy hatted head spins through the air severed from the torso. Sheriff Warner Codge is dead."
: Loot that body!
": I hope his final thing that he was looking at was his phone filling with get nasty, get nasty, get nasty."
: We should have get nasty written on underneath the Wurst.
: Oh yeah it's definitely the Wurst colon Get Nasty.
": Barry, that is gonna be your turn."
": Sweet, Sid do you think you can hit the two that are coupled up with a grenade?"
": Yeah, I definitely can. Do you think that we're trying to get at, I mean, I guess I'm wondering if it's worth the resource of a grenade or if we should just fricking disengage 'cause these are all a bunch of wieners."
": Damn right they're a bunch of wieners I'm going just, do I wanna jump down? I get, yeah, I have as much HP as anyone else. So I will, am I gonna take damage if I hop down?"
: Falling damage unless you have a way to move.
"M: Yeah, I'm do my, can I do my jump thing? My jump 30 feet thing and then if I land between those two guys, will I do five damage to each of 'em? 'Cause it's that's what the, Barry's instinct while raging bonus action you leap 30 feet, you deal kinetic damage equal to strength within five feet of you. Can I hit the two that are like coupled up?"
Brennan: Yes you can.
M: Sweet So I'm gonna jump and I'm gonna Iron Man stance and do five damage to both of 'em.
": Hell yes okay, let's get Barry back in here, baby."
: Let's get Barry back in here.
: Let's get Barry back in here.
: Let's get Barry back in here.
: Let's go ahead and get Barry back in here.
: Let's fly in Barry.
: Okay is that automatically five damage to each of them?
": Yeah, it's just five, it's just my strength modifier."
": Cool they're uninjured so five damage to both of those deputies on either side of you and that's gonna be so that's your movement. You jump down, or that's your bonus action?"
: That's my bonus action yeah.
: Cool what else you doing?
": So then I don't wanna shoot with disadvantage, so I guess I'll, do I still shoot with yeah okay. I'll back up so I guess I have to take opportunity attacks. Which sucks, but that's just what it is."
: It is what it is.
: One of those is gonna hit.
: Okay I'm gonna use a reaction to heal and get it back.
": Sorry, wait a minute. No, there is no hit. No hit, yeah awesome. So yeah, you step away you can go wherever you want."
: Sweet I'll just back up five feet and then shoot at the floor between the two of them.
": Cool amazing, and they're making dex saves?"
: Dex saves yeah.
: Gotcha.
: Killed by this beautiful antique tile. How humiliating.
: What is it you add to your weapon attack?
": Seven, so DC 15."
: Oh they both fail.
: Yes.
: Yes.
: Good roll.
: Absolutely.
": Oh I re roll ones,"
": You (BOOM! sound) they are knocked flat and you roll up both of them are toast, done."
: Nice.
": Beautiful, Barry."
: And then I will use the rest of my movement to hop behind the bar with everybody else.
S: Oh will you grab me?
: Yeah.
: Oh yeah.
": Object interaction, you grab the psychodrone."
": I'm so glad you did that 'cause I was like, okay, I have this magnetic armor I'll hack it to be bad again to try and attract the drone."
": Riva, you are in Barry's big strong clone arms or your rather your psychodrone is. Sid, that's gonna be you it's you and Gunnie and there's only two officers left in the Slop Bucket."
": Okay, are we trying to fucking kill him?"
: Yes.
: Okay.
: Barry just with sunglasses.
: Absolutely in the sunglasses.
": Problem is this, okay? So I'm gonna try and the one who's at the bar, let's see it's..."
: Deputy five.
": Deputy five, I'm gonna try and just shoot deputy five."
": Cool they have cover 'cause you're like firing over the bar at them, but go ahead and roll an attack roll."
": They have cover, okay, I'm gonna go for it. Weapon expert gives me advantage, so does a 19 hit?"
: 19 Hits.
: Okay so six damage.
: Six damage does not get the job done.
"Emily: Oh fuck me I really didn't wanna use my grenades. Oh, I only have good grenades left."
": I thought you had a shitty ion one, don't you?"
"Emily: No, the ions are really cool 'cause they do things. All right, fuck it I gotta do it, I think I say,"
"Sid: Marge, if I use all my grenades, will you give me a grenade budget?"
: Of course I will.
: I'm gonna bonus action throw a incendiary grenade at this person.
: Cool.
: Set this place on fire.
": Six, this person, they fail the saving throw."
: Okay they take-
: I love the idea of try to be like conservative and just like shoot and saying fuck it.
: Eight more damage.
: Down.
": Yes and then reaction I'm gonna throw a grenade at that oh, the last one, another incendiary grenade."
: Hell yes.
": Do I have anything that no, I think incendiary doesn't."
": They fail the save, go ahead and roll damage."
": Oh, and they took damage they took half damage from a grenade before, right?"
": Yes, yes, yes."
": Okay, good. Eight plus - eight!"
": Skip goes through the window, Barry jumps down, lights the place up, two grenades, boom, boom, Margaret, on her phone, baby."
: Because I shot my weapon.
: Can I sleight of hand that I do a little Kublacaine while I'm on my phone?
": Yeah, for sure, little bump."
"S: Yeah, it's all on me. So you can just grab it off my dead body."
": Tech point so that my AC is 19 now, and I think I'm just gonna use my movement to get the fuck outta here."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, we are going to, you know what? I'm not gonna call that we exit combat right now, what I'm gonna say is for a moment there are no combatants for you guys. You have partial cover, zone, you see Sid's got a briefcase full of Kublacaine outside the decapitated Sheriff, his headless body is holding a burner transponder with an open Smash 'n Grab app."
: I'm gonna grab it and look at it confused and throw it to Marge.
"Brennan: You catch it. Anyone who wants to, give me a perception check?"
": Yeah, I wanna get the fuck outta here."
": Is there any way we can use his thing and pretend to be him or something, do a voice thing?"
: 12.
: 16.
: 14.
: Has anybody got good deception?
": I have a disguise kit, I can't do that to like disguise my voice, can I?"
": Wait, we could hold it up to his decapitated head and do a FaceTime."
Brennan: Did anyone did anyone here beat a 20 on the perception?
: I got a dirty 20.
: Dirty 20 okay.
: I can do defiant if it feels like I need to beat it.
": You have, I think what you need you hear sirens that are probably multiple, probably many rounds away you're talking about like 10, between 10 and 15 combat rounds."
: Oh shit.
: Away?
": Now that's like, you know, like two minutes, two or three minutes but you have a second here."
": Okay, we look at all their guns and I take all their grenades."
": Guns, grenades."
": I, yeah, I'm just gonna sleight of hand and just like search the dude. Take his hat for Riva."
: Cool.
: Can I give us five stars?
": You can absolutely give, are you gonna leave a review?"
: Absolutely.
: Absolutely.
: Go ahead and give me a performance check real quick.
: Can I give the help action?
: Yeah that's a 21.
": 21, cool. Couple words, what does Margaret say for the Sheriff's review?"
": I'm a man of few words, but this blew my fucking mind."
": Five stars, Margaret, you click through on the burner. Second five star review."
: Oh my gosh and a tip.
": Speaking of which, can we leave a tip for the waitstaff? I feel really bad that we had this gun battle in their place as well."
: True.
: Totally.
: I mean that guy with the dreads is fully on fire while he tries to eat chicken.
: I mean let's loot their pockets and then they can have all the leave it all as tips.
: We should get some Slop to go.
: Can I shoot that burner phone?
: Yeah after you hit the review.
: Can I kind of go through it a little bit just to see if there's any other.
": It's clean as a bone, the only thing that we're using it for was this. Margaret tosses it in the air and you skeet shot the phone outta the air."
: Can we take his horrifying wrist gun?
: Yeah.
": I want guns, I want grenades."
: Take the hat and the badge.
: Hell yes.
": I'm so dead I'm not, I can't say any of this."
": So what is the play here? What is the, I'm gonna say? You have a very short amount of time to communicate."
: Jib-Jobbers?
": Let's just get to the, this person doesn't know what our ship is we just need to get the fuck away from here."
: Hot exit.
: Yeah.
: I wanna get out of here..
: Does anyone have a stealth thing that they can use to help us?
": I can do smuggle again, let's smuggle ourselves out of here."
: We're gonna try to sneak out of the building and get to the ship without being seen.
: Right on.
": I'm gonna need a with smuggle, another group stealth check as you all attempt to move outta here, you have a couple rounds in which to do so."
: Do I roll for this?
": No, you're gonna come with, Barry's got you."
: Nat one.
: Nat one.
": My God, the stealth rolls."
: You re roll ones.
: I re roll ones!
: Plus what?
: 16 plus 10 plus six.
: 32.
: Dirty 20.
: Dirty 20.
: 32.
: Mine was a 23.
: Also 32? Okay we have two 32s?
": I only got a five, but that becomes a 24."
: 24?
: I got a 13.
"Brennan: 13, okay yes gotcha. Okay so the so 24 is our like low point here for the, for the top three of the group. Anything else you do? 'cause we have a smuggle from our tech caster here."
: I think I am like scrambling all devices around us.
"Brennan: I'm gonna tell you what you loot 'cause you're trying to do all this pretty fast and get outta here. So you don't don't really have time to actually go through every single body, but you're so you cast that tech power and have a second to loot. Margaret, you go through the phone here. Barry?"
: I'll help loot.
: Real quick I'm gonna take his head and stick it to the top of one of those cactuses.
: I'm gonna say you take his head stick it on top of a cactus. Do you want grab the badge here as well?
: Yeah.
": Okay you grab the badge and the hat. You can mark that down in your inventory. Gunnie, what are you up to."
: Repair droid on Sid.
: Hell yeah.
: Thank you.
: And that's it.
"Brennan: Cool, because you got that high stealth here I'm gonna say no longer in combat the DC to repair Riva's psychodrone is gonna drop down to a DC"
": Got it, I'm out-oh no. Yeah, I could do that. Let me see..."
: Can I help?
": Yeah, you can help."
: Hit it.
"Brennan: Okay. Riva, psychodrone comes back up with one hit point."
": Great, that's good enough for me. Does this restaurant have a magnet area?"
"Brennan: You see that one of the, one of the waitresses, all of the staff here and some of the customers when this happened, literally all of them just kind of nonchalantly, slid under tables and kind of got under and you see she comes up and says,"
"Lamelia: Oh honey, bless your heart. Do if you do wanna, if you wanna leave a tip for them, you absolutely can."
: We want to leave a tip for sure.
Brennan: Okay what kind of tip do you leave?
: Probably like a bunch of Kublacaine.
: I was thinking the same thing.
": Let's give them, just give one."
: I give them a bag of Kublacaine.
: A bag?
: That's a lot.
": Not a brick, not a brick, a bag, we cut open a brick and we made a little bag."
: A little bag and I put a little smiley face stamp on it.
"Brennan: Oh you have like a whole protocol droid thing anyway. Yeah a little stamped baggy of Kublacaine. You see she says,"
"Lamelia: Oh sugar, bless your heart. That's so sweet."
: Have fun but not too much fun.
: I can't promise that. This happens a lot.
: Yeah also here's 500 credits.
: Hell yeah she takes it amazing.
: Can our drug stamp be a hot dog?
"Brennan: Drug stamp is a little hot dog, boom. Go ahead and give me an intimidate check with advantage if you'd be so kind."
: Nat 20.
: Oh my god.
": Oh my goodness, the Sheriff is in."
: Does that mean we can just walk to the ship?
: I shot the Sheriff.
: And I also shot the Sheriff.
: You hit a nat 20 intimidate check?
: On the second one it went 20.
": As you begin to stealth out of here, you grab, oh, you grab two incendiary grenades, you grab another ion grenade. You grab two plasma grenades and a stun grenade you all of them have all of them have blaster rifles."
: Oh my God.
": All of them have blaster rifles. All of you: Gunnie, you're repairing Androids you get Riva back up and operational. You guys all come out to see Skip has mounted the Sheriff's head on a cactus outside."
: Is it Christmas?
"Brennan: You guys on a nat 20 intimidate check. I don't have too many rules as a dungeon master, but you honour Nat 20s. On a Nat 20 intimidate check you guys loot as fast as you can. You got your review, you also gave yourself a 20% tip, right? So 6.000 credits clears to, In addition to the full case of Kublacaine that you have, you guys vanish into the night with probably only like three or four rounds to spare, you hear sirens in town, everyone converging on Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket sneaking through town there's security locks Deputies could be coming for you at any time, you hear the sirens begin to die down you're still stealthing through markets. As you go you see out through like a little highway passage you see there is a Sheriff's department cruiser that no lights on zips past you, you're all hidden, you guys like duck into an alley. You see it hits a ramp, hits a highway, going outta town. Two more cruisers come after it zooming to the exit."
: They're fleeing town.
"Brennan: You see the entire, you, you don't you begin to realize you haven't been hearing sirens in a second."
: Let's loot the Sheriff's office.
: It's all about looting.
: Lets steal from the sheriff.
: I'm all in.
": Wait, but this also means we could go to the junkyard tomorrow."
: Yes.
: Yes.
": We just have, we can just, we can stick around Baustin we don't have to do a hot exit."
: We don't have to do a hot exit.
: A cold exit.
: Can we go to butt Plug's store and talk to him and see if he's alive.
: Is he alive?
: Can we save him?
: Can we save Plug?
": You all you, none of you guys are hearing sirens. You go through town. It's, you know, it's you know, you're looking around. Wait, you guys came here too it's like broad daylight. So you guys looking around, people are, it's like starting to be the lunch crowd. People are going to go eat. Yeah, no, no sirens at all. You see there's like happy Skiff Fest people walking along. You're all covered in, you know, blood and smoke and shrapnel and stuff like that."
": I minor illusion to make it look like I have even more blood on me, minor hologram."
": So yeah as you guys are walking through town, what do you all do?"
: We gotta see if Plug's alive.
: We gotta.
: Number one.
: And make him the Sheriff if he's alive.
": Oh my god, oh my god."
": If he's alive, he's the sheriff."
: Absolutely.
: You gingerly walk you're all stealthing. You're still smuggling. You're going to through back alleys. How long do you guys stay stealthy as you head towards Plug's?
: Okay we can't go in stealthy to Plug because we might startle him and cause the heart attack in which case.
": I wonder if we had some kind oracular prophecy, that told him that he was going to die on this day."
: Let's just knock politely.
: Good idea.
": You get to Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut and you knock on the, you don't even have to knock as you approach, you see Plug up at the front."
: Plug!
": Plug, you're alive."
": Hello there friend, of course I'm alive. Why wouldn't I be alive for?"
: You said about three times yesterday that you were gonna die tomorrow.
": Well, it's not tomorrow, it's today."
: Oh.
: Fuck this.
: We're not doing this bullshit.
: We were worried about you.
": Well say why, what you, what were you worried about?"
": Just a quick question, 'cause you know this town way better than us, but if all the cops seemingly fleed, do you think they will come back?"
": Well, the cops in this town were a source of absolute chaos and tyranny who made life a living hell for everybody in town, so if all the cops fled probably for the better."
: That's the Sheriff's blood.
: This is his badge and hat.
: Well ding dong the Sheriff's dead.
: Well we really just wanted to check in on you.
: We were worried about you.
": Oh because yesterday I said tomorrow and tomorrow is the day, today for yesterday."
": If I give you a bag of drugs, will you gimme those rocket boots?"
": If you give me a bag of drugs, you'll never see me again. What, what?"
: Maybe we should give him a bag of drugs. I know we can theoretically have everything in his store.
: I give him a bag of drugs.
": Well, that's your mistake. The bag lodges up his nose."
: Oh my God.
": He says ""Goodbye,"" and he twinkles into light."
: What?
: Oh my God.
: What?
: Okay.
: Plug!
: Wow.
: Can I just like wave my hand?
: It was today after all.
": He's just gone, he's fully gone."
": Can I just look around, make perception check for a will?"
": Oh, write us into it."
": Can I look around for the most expensive thing in Plug's Butts, Plug's butts, Plug's Ugly Butt Stuff Store?"
: Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut.
: Yes.
": You see, yeah go ahead and give me an investigation check."
: I'll help.
": What's the most expensive thing in here? Okay oh, that's a… That's a 23."
: You start looking around in the in the Stuff Hut. Hold on one...
": What are we, is this ours now?"
: This is crazy.
": Was this a trade? The last 15 minutes were, I thought I was about to watch maybe some of you die and now we may be the law in this town and this man turned into star stuff."
: I think Skip is the Sheriff and Sid is Plug.
: Oh wait.
: I'm Plug?
: Who was the person we met at the dock?
: La-marie?
: She should be the Sheriff.
: You're right with that.
: And all the Chesters can be cops.
": Deputies, yeah."
: Why did we come to Butt Plug's.
": I don't know if this town actually needs cops, unbalanced, I feel like the cops are just doing."
: That person might know a lot better what to do than this person.
": There is a you see that there are some gloves sort of like knee pad, elbow pad. There is friction grip gear here."
: You absolutely have to take that.
: What is friction grip gear?
: So you can climb the walls.
: Should I pay for it? Is that a thing?
: I think we already did.
: No we paid for it in drugs.
": Yeah I just, I take it all. I have to fix it probably when we get back, but yeah, I'll take it. I'll take the friction gear."
: Can I do one more look for rocket boots?
: You can give me another investigation check.
: Can I help?
": I'll help, yeah."
": Oh god I almost crit, but 21."
": 21, I'll say on a 21 we'll make it an even luck check. You want an 11 or higher. Eight, sorry."
: Can I add my defiant to it?
: Yeah give me a defiant if you roll a one then it's no good.
: Four.
": Oh, you find a set of very badly broken rocket boots here."
: Hell yes. Hell yes.
: This is the best day I've ever had. I do some drugs. I don't.
": Do we have to leave like, should we go back to the dock."
": Let's just go to the ship and let's just continue our trip. A strange exhilarating nausea fills the group. As all of you just realize like, you know, the murder plan was very ill advised. You came very close to maybe all dying, but having stood your ground, it seems that seeing like the dead body and you realize that not knowing how close all of you guys came to death. The other member, the other deputies arrived at Slops or arrived at Swallop's Slop and Gravy Bucket to see everybody dead, the Sheriff's head mounted on a pike and none of you on the ground. So it looked to them like, oh, well all of our lives, as we knew them are over effective immediately. So Baustin is just sort of undergoing, there is the weird dissonance of a town enjoying a very fun Skiff Festival."
: Oh I forgot about the Skiff Festival.
": With its entire like with the entire power structure at the center of the town gone. Another glorious day in AnarchEra, a group of very dangerous proldiers descended from the sky and completely uprooted the power structure, the corrupt power structure of this town."
": Wow I feel like Riva's so filled with adrenaline that they're just Naruto running up and down the street, like a child with far too much energy."
: Should we fix our ship?
": Yeah let's fix it, I don't know?"
: Let's go to the Skiff Festival?
: Yeah let's go to the Skiff Festival.
: Let's sell drugs at the Skiff Festival.
: Perfect.
: If we can sell enough drugs then we get a casino.
": 100%, I mean, I'm gonna need some time to attach the stuff we get anyway so it's like, you guys can hang out, Skiff, me and the Chesters will get this ship ready I mean, come on, we earned this."
: We slide really fast from a hot exit scenario to a really fun montage of you all skiffing for a couple days.
": Oh my God, just arms wrapped around big Barry."
: Just so sunburnt.
: Yeah incredible so you guys have a couple days in Baustin if you want to do these mods.
: Let's fix the ship up.
": Okay so we got another 6.000, right?"
: Yeah.
: I'd like to ride this high real quick.
: Okay.
": So I've been thinking a lot about ways in which we, as a crew can make money, right? And I was thinking about, so you know, me and Barry went to go get kitchen utensils or chef's tools. That's right they're called, we called them chef's tools. They're kitchen utensils, we went to get chef's tools, but we got stopped along the way at a casino and we lost 500 credits like that and then we lost 500 more credits like that."
: And we can't do that again 'cause that's a lot of credits even when we're rich.
: But what if other people could?
: We buy a casino?
: No.
: We make a casino on our ship. We've got one area left for modifications let's make a casino.
: Like a river boat?
: Yeah I mean we've got a whole group of people with nothing to do other than write their screenplays and do their graphic design.
": That's boring, they'd much rather rather be gambling."
: They'd much rather be gambling.
: Can we do that?
: Add a casino to the ship?
: Yeah.
": 100% yes, absolutely."
: How much is it? How much is it?
: It's only 10.000 credits.
: I'll put in money for it.
: I'm happy to stake my full share like I'll put 5.000 down on it. So I just need 5.000 more people and a willingness to take the last open space on the ship and turn it into a casino.
: I'm in for two.
: For two what?
: Two grand.
": Okay that's seven. I only need three more and then I probably need, I wanna buy a Bar-Buddy to operate it."
": I'm in for that three, I'm in for that three."
": I'll do, don't do the whole three, I'll do, let's split it at 1500."
": I'll give you all of my money. I mean, between the Kublacaine we have, and the alcohol."
: We should set aside some Kublacaine for the casino.
": I mean, you know."
: We should have stolen more booze.
": Are we bad, are we bad?"
: I don't know! We took over a town.
: We're just using the world as we have it.
": Of course, we had a ton of fun right?"
: I had a terrible time.
": Well, I had a great time and we got to fall a thousand feet, it was amazing."
: How much could we like make in a casino do you think?
": There's, there are actually rules for this. So-"
: Per day? Per weekend?
": It's a per day and it, we roll a D20 every day, and if it's more, the there's like a break even under between 10 and five."
"Brennan: Right so on your guys' ship, however, technically only large ships have it, but we're gonna allow it for a medium size ship, 'cause it's actually a pretty standard everything's just another degree 10 lower. So you guys are gonna be effectively like when you're driving through Nevada and a gas station has like two slot machines in the back, right?"
: Yes.
"Brennan: So on a nat one, you would lose 900 credits that day, on a two through three, you would lose 480 credits that day, on a four through seven you'd break even, and then as you go up you'd start to make more, it's possible on a nat 20 that you'd make 1500 credits in a day from your casino."
": I mean, come on."
: All right so we'll just park it places and then make it for?
": Yeah, we can just have it open."
": Gunnie, I have to ask you a really personal question. Riva, read his mind. Is there a chance that you're going to go in there and lose all your money to our own casino?"
S: Yeah I am gonna cast probe mind to find out the truth.
": I mean, if, I mean, I don't think I would be gambling there all the time. I mean, I'm gonna gamble there all the time. I would just do, I mean, I think I would be there in a supervisory role, but that doesn't mean I can't play. So I would just kind, I mean, I think I would just, I would be much more of a managerial role, but managers play, just because you're a manager doesn't mean you can't have fun. So yeah, I don't, I think fully that my role would just be as a person who makes sure people are having fun and doing stuff by also having fun myself and setting an example to everyone else. So don't worry about a thing."
": The thing, Gunnie, I'm just kind of doing the, and you're a much smarter guy than me, but I'm kind of doing the math here, right? We've got this like super intelligent AI thing, so we've got a bunch of people who wanna murder us. We constantly need to update the ship so that we don't die."
: A hundred percent.
": If every day the casino went as good as it possibly could, we will earn our money back in 10 days of it going perfectly."
: Yes.
: And that is if we're still alive.
": So if we crit, 10 days in a row?"
: We would break even.
: We all just-
": I will say that Gunnie is extremely confident about his ability to gamble and, but he is my friend so I trust him in that."
: I'm going to go ahead and abstain so I'm in for whatever other people decide.
": That's not a no, gotcha."
": My thing is, is that when I go in, I go in really hard. So I'm lightly out at the moment."
": I think I'm gonna, I knowing how little money is here, knowing that if there's 10 crits."
: I could see us dying.
": For us to break even, I think I'm gonna take my money back, but I'm not gonna."
": That's cool, that's cool, that's all."
: I'm gonna leave my money there unless more people vote not to do it.
: Okay.
": I support you Gunnie, I just want-"
: I'm emotionally gonna help in any way I can.
": In no way, this was fully a like kind of talk meeting. This was a pitch. You motherfuckers are walking away from the opportunity of a lifetime."
": You convinced me, I'm back in."
: I'm confidently walking into the opportunity of a lifetime it's gonna be a great place for us to sell our drugs and I'm gonna set up a Pleasure Putty booth.
: I'm back in.
: I'm in!
: I'm back in but only with one grand this time.
": Okay that's fine so we got one grand, so we got my five, we got one."
: 1500.
: Another 1.5.
: That's 7.500.
: That's yeah.
: And an extra 5.000.
: Okay guys Barry's Big Win Casino is founded.
": So whatever money we have left over, we can spend on real things."
": Great well, there you go."
: I guess to have a slush fund.
": Jesus Christ, okay so."
": So do we do our first roll in the, or that's once it's built? In the casino."
: I think Gunnie and the Chets have to.
: Gunnie and the Chets.
: Need to build the casino.
": Got it, got it, got it."
"Brennan: It's only gonna take two days to update with the casino. You go to you go to the junkyard Baustin's a very fun town. So there's skeeballs. There's like old, you see, there's like old sort of like fortune telling machines that can be changed into slot machines. There's a lot of- you get tables, this place I mean, this place has pool halls, and poker tables and all that stuff. You get blackjack tables, no problem, you're set."
": Can I bring up one thing? And I'm, again, I'm putting my money in. Have, do we have any money set aside for a stealth mode for the ship."
": We, we do."
: Okay awesome.
": We had a full, like after buying fuel, we have a full 2.900 left in just the ship, the ship account and then if we add its take from the most recent job, we should be able to afford, oh no, that's halved so we need another half. We need another about 3000. Is there any leftover from the 5.000 I gave you, oh, a hundred percent, you can have a full 4.000 of that back."
": I mean, for that?"
: Then put the 4.000 towards the stealth mode.
": Yeah okay, cool, cool that just seems like-"
: We absolutely need that.
: Right.
: Can we also-
: Especially if we're going to like Bajar world or whatever.
: We should use these two days to also sell some drugs to get some like.
": I mean, this is like, there's no law enforcement."
: It's also-
: We're the enforcement.
": Each of those Chets earns so it's 200 credits to hire those Chets for two days,"
: We should pay them a little above their average.
: We should tip them.
: Yeah.
: I'll tip them in magnets.
: I take a magnet and give them each a magnet.
: Very thank you for removing that my fridge.
": You're absolutely welcome, I can't understand what you say because you gave off no psychic waves, but I'm assuming that you said thank you."
: Daisy your hat and a dollar out the door.
: Absolutely.
"Brennan: You see the Chets get back to work. Lou, whenever you're ready give me a mechanics check."
: You got it.
Emily: Can I give him Handy Annie?
: Yeah.
": Yeah, yeah, go for it."
"L: Hate that. Love that, that's gonna be a cool 26."
"Brennan: Two days of work, 200 credits down with these Chets working. You see the Chets, when you pay them, Lamelia checks a thing on her phone 'cause she built all these Chesters. She's like,"
"Lamelia: Good work boys, way to go."
Brennan: And the Chets keep working and that's going after two days Barry's Big Win Casino is up and running.
: You guys wanna come the ribbon cutting?
": I'm in a fucking stunning evening gown with a flute of champagne at the opening, so hot."
: I think also I'm getting like aerial drone footage to cut together like a commercial of Barry's Big Win.
: Like the Mohegan Sun?
": Oh yeah we put out like a commercial that's just like ""Nothing but wins at Barry's Big Win Casino."""
": Barry's Big Win Casino, now here's the deal. So it's two days of that, during the two days that you're building the casino with the Chesters. What are the rest of you doing, knowing that you're about to open this casino on the ship?"
: Going to the Skiff thing talking about the casino loudly.
: I wanna go to the skiff thing and ask about Bajar worlds.
": Oh, ask about the Griivarr worlds."
: Griivarr worlds.
": Yes, no worries. Cool, first of all, anyone who's going out there also, did you guys, I assume all the money bookkeeping is happening."
: Did you have this new?
": I haven't added the, I mean with the money we already had plus our signing bonuses that covers the, and what everyone put in that's without contract that's without the, I haven't distributed the 6.000 yet."
": Oh cool, if we wanna do that, then let's do it."
: We also have that to split.
: So the 6.000-
: 6.000.
": Divided by seven with a ship, with a share for the ship."
": Yeah, so what's that?"
": That would be, that's a weird fraction, but it's basically, it's basically 857 credits for everybody and then one"
: Is someone keeping track of the ship?
: Yeah it has 3.797 in its coffers.
: 857.
: Yeah.
": And, and then you have this big, old case of Kublacaine that is a little bit touched at this point because of Plug and, but mostly still there. What do you guys wanna do with that? Is that something that you want to try? Obviously you will make a lot more money trying to move that yourselves, but then you are holding on this scary thing that people can find out about and come and steal and da, da, da."
: Maybe we should-
: Just do a big brief case deal?
: With that guy from.
: Yeah the cool skiff dude.
": Crunchy, crunchy moon, man?"
: Yeah.
: You guys can go to skiff ball if you want.
: Yeah.
"Brennan: You go to this big club downtown it's on this big sort of dune area, overlooking the big sort of like racing dunes and some sort of rocky canyons and stuff out in the field, and you see that same guy from Swallop's the other night sort of looking around this place is like swanky down here. It's like, there's big, weird, triple horned Longhorn skulls, like alien steer and stuff like that up on the walls. Lots of tables that are like industrial sort of like those big wooden things that look like they should go in like a mill or a plant somewhere with like rope around the center pillar kind of thing. Saw dust on the floor and you're like, there is no business here that creates sawdust. This was put here."
: Authentic.
": And you see this guy. Yeah so you total, well I've been coming out here for, like I remember when Skiff Fest had like nobody here like truly?"
: Oh my god.
": Like 20, 30, people here."
: You're good at talking.
: I guess.
: I'm so good at talking.
": I was wondering if like, do you wanna?"
: All I do is talk.
: Do we wanna try to do like a Storage Wars thing though? Like getting people to bid on the cases?
: What could possibly be in?
": I mean, first of all, if we're gonna sell the entire brief, I, my feeling is we should just get rid of this one pack that's already open and then wait and sell the rest on the Griivarr world where we'll make a lot more money."
: And we'll get absolutely murdered.
: Are you kidding me?
: That's like bringing drugs to Disney World.
: We ran all of the sheriffs outta here and this is kind of the best place to just get it out of our hands.
": And just to be clear, we don't wanna do Storage Wars?"
": I think we should do a Extreme Home Makeover, And then we say move that bus and then it's just a briefcase,"
: I would like to get out.
: I think that strategy works best when there might be nothing valuable inside.
": Okay I get another briefcase, now we have two."
": Oh, now we're doing a Deal or No Deal."
": Incredible so yeah. You guys see sort of party again, a lot of like core worlders here visiting Baustin. What else do you guys do while you're here? Oh yeah you see this guy yeah."
": So I'd like to do an insight check contested against this target's charisma or deception. So I rolled a dirty 20 and this, so I now have advantage on attack rolls and ability checks against the target until the end of my next turn."
: Sneak attack.
": I stab him and I fucking steal his shoes. And I think I will let me see which one of my delicious little things if I try to, to sell stuff to him, will he then have to make a saving throw?"
: He will not have to make a savings throw.
": Or ability check, it's an ability check."
": You can get advantage on this roll with that ability. So if you wanna make a persuasion check with advantage, go for it."
: Great I will make a persuasion check with advantage.
: Yeah 'cause we knew how much he sold it to us for.
: Right exactly.
": Well, this is not the guy that you bought drugs from this is the rich dude who was at the bar making a lot of noise yeah."
: Okay that is a 25.
: Yes.
: Whoa.
": So I'm going to give him the low, low deal of 1.25 times what it's actually worth."
": Oh, oh, okay."
": Because he sold it, he bought last time at 1.5 times. So at 1.25 times what?"
": There you go so as you approach, you hear sort of twangy electro banjo music playing and this guys like yeah like the first year I came out here truly there were 20 people and they only had ski skiffs."
: That's amazing.
: Hello.
: Hi.
: Oh my God. Are you a bot?
": No, I'm actually an Aguatunisian in a psychic drone."
": Oh, what, wild! Hello."
: Now I actually talked to you before I don't know if you remember me.
": I am so sorry, how rude."
": No, it's absolutely fine. No, we had a great conversation about drugs."
: Love it.
": And I was like, this is a man who's interested in drugs and maybe would like to buy a lot of them because you know, it's a great deal for you and it's probably a great deal for your friends."
": I walk up and I say, excuse me, are you talking about buying a lot of drugs 'cause I'm very interested. I'll pay whatever you want."
": No, no, no this good man has been."
": Sorry, sorry, hey, hey, hey, sorry. One second I'm talking to my friend so just hold on."
: Oh you two know each other.
: Yeah.
": We, we go way back."
": I'm so proud of you like in the depths of my heart. I'm like, well then my mistake."
: For real.
: If you're interested in becoming your own boss-
": Yeah for real thank you so much, I appreciate it."
": You're so welcome, anytime."
": Yeah I would be so happy to make a deal. How much are, how much are you looking to unload?"
: I open the briefcase and light shines upon him like a golden.
: You look at this dude who looks completely unphased by this amount of drugs in front of him.
: My God.
"Brennan: And he goes,"
"Oh, sick. Okay yeah you know what's funny is I did come with some sort of like light pockets to Skiff Fest this year, a little bit of like egg on my face yeah."
": Absolutely sure I completely understand, yeah."
: For sure.
": Obviously there's other people who were interested, but I came to you first, but if you don't."
": Appreciate that see, I appreciate that so much. I have like, I feel like a total turd. My name is Crunch Moon-Jones and-"
R: What an incredible name my name is-
S: And I impart my true name of-
": Oh my God, you're incredible."
: I feel like we have a real connection.
: Can I sleight of hand some drugs for us to keep?
": Yeah, one brick."
": Incredible yeah, just some for your troubles. Yeah some fun."
"B: Yeah. You see, he looks at you and says,"
": Yeah, I would like, first of all, the vibes I'm picking up from you are incredible. And I fully, fully believe in that. Second, yeah I'd be happy to take that off your hands, that'd actually be great. And I have some friends coming up to a hotel room later. We have the entire top floor of the Lauret."
: Really?
: Yeah for sure.
": Yeah I mean, if you'd be cool with it that sounds like an amazing time to me."
: Yeah absolutely.
: Can I make an insight check on this?
Brennan: Yeah go for it.
: 17.
": 17\. You notice that this guy is a doofus and is commanding a tremendous amount of respect in the room, like lots of people are smiling at this guy and saying nice things to him."
: What was his name again?
": Yeah, exactly."
: A trust fund.
: Yeah who's your daddy?
: What's that?
: Sorry.
: Who's your daddy.
": What, are you a sick freak, dude?"
: Yeah.
: You want to be? All right so this guy wants to party. Does your whole crew wanna party?
": Yes, dude."
": Oh, sick. How much you want it for?"
: Absolutely.
: How much does do we want for it?
: Oh.
: 1.5 markup.
: So you're saying 1.25 mark up but I'm gonna ask if you give a number to him.
": Which is a cut down, I mean, I don't know."
: How much is it worth?
: If six servings of Kublacaine?
: Gotcha gotcha.
: I take a lot of drugs. It was 810.
: Five figures.
"Brennan: If you want, yeah. Give me, give me like a business check right now. DC 25 is the exact number. DC 20 is like ballpark."
: Business would be what?
: Expertise plus intelligence so plus nine.
": That's a 10, including the plus nine because I rolled a nat one."
": You think, you think this is probably worth about like between 30 and 40.000."
": So, so I that's what I think it's worth."
: Yeah.
: Reasonably?
: I'm smart.
": We'll take 90.000, none less."
": We'll take 90.000, none less."
": 90.000, hey, I know it's Skiff Fest, that's pretty steep what do we say we call an even 60K."
: 75.
: Give me one last persuasion check.
: Here it is.
: Do we have advantage on all persuasion checks?
: Yeah 'cause he is into you.
": Yeah, you can take advantage."
: Great I'll take advantage of this man. That is a 26.
: Says 75k on the condition that you and your friends party with me all night.
: 75K!
: Am I still working on the ship?
": Yes, you're still working."
: So I don't know we just made 75k?
: No idea.
: You have no idea why you're dancing but you just start dancing.
": Oh, we are on the comms."
: I fully start grab a Chester and just start shaking him. YES!
": You're a daisy if you do, Ringo!"
: You start shaking a Chester.
: I feel that adrenaline in my real body.
: Anything we could do anything now.
: I think that we are-
: We haven't even taken drugs and we can do anything.
: Does anyone else feel like every single success means we gotta get--
: The bigger our pockets get the more I feel like a that's gonna be like a pinata that's gonna be like attacked.
: I feel fine.
": Do you want, do you wanna put stealthing on the ship? Do you wanna?"
: Yes.
: I think to go to Griivarr Land we need it.
: Okay.
: I can come help you with that.
: Yeah we'd like to also put stealthing on the ship. Yeah we're gonna put a stealth device on the ship.
: Okay you're gonna put a stealth device on the ship.
"Siobhan: And I don't wanna have to say it every day, but I just wanna just check in that basically I'm casting psychic concealment every day on Gnosis."
Brennan: Copy that.
: So every day they are.
: Gnosis and the Princeps?
: That's a lot of spell points.
": Oh, okay that's more."
": That's six, I mean it's six of my 26."
: But every day yeah that's kinda hard.
: But I mean these days that we're just working.
": Okay yeah to install that is another 7.000 credits, another 200 for the Chets, and that one you can get done in a day."
: Is it all right if it comes out of the 75K we just made?
: I mean that would be Marge's.
": Yeah, absolutely."
: Okay yeah if the co-owner agrees.
": Yes Marge, I'm so sorry that I just spoke for you."
": I don't know if you guys looked at those contracts that you signed, but this is a six way partnership we're six-way owners of the Wurst."
: Is that true?
: That's true.
Emily: So in a couple of days I went from a companion to a co-owner.
": Yeah, definitely."
"Brennan: You guys look at your contracts and see that indeed you guys all have an equal stake in the Wurst. As you do that, I'm also gonna need investigation checks. I just want to get an investigation check first for the casino system, just to make sure that you were able to get all the right good parts for it and there's not some weird thing wrong with it."
: Okay fuck.
: This is really gonna set the tone.
: The roulette always ends on-
: 22.
Brennan: Oh hell yes. That is a success. You find enough stuff in the junkyards here. Now I'm going to need one for the stealth device. This is an investigation.
": Since I'm helping with this, may I do one as well."
: This one's not just me.
": Oh, baby that's gonna be a 26."
: I'll take that.
"Brennan: You guys go out to a junkyard your third day in Baustin, Baustin, the mood in Baustin has never been brighter. You guys go to a junkyard you find this incredible old Acme-Ashmun brand stealth cloaking device. Easy, easy, easy fix to get it installed, give me one more mechanics check to get it installed."
: Also I think I'm gonna linger in the junkyard after this.
": Right, can I do-"
: 18.
: 18 will do it.
": A luck check in the junkyard to see, just like, you know, when you go to the thrift store and you're just like, I'm not looking for anything I'm just open to something cool."
": I think I just kind of wanna linger a little bit because I'm like, even though like the ball's rolling up, like I am aware that I am the keeper of souls and so I kind of just wanna like look around and see if I see any parts of like discontinued droids."
Brennan: Give me a little investigation check.
: Cool.
: It's 21.
: 21.
": Just kind of like, like kind of like a, a morbid fascination of like what I'm up against."
"Brennan: You, on a 21 you find a old poster in the junk yard of a brand of Androids out here and you see, it looks like an old sort of mechanic Android. You see it's called Servo Sam and you see, it's just wearing mechanics coveralls and has little hat and has like a krystal pump thing here, and you see a bunch of discarded cracked krystals that you recognize as sort of the hard drives of this sort of like line of Androids that there may have been a few of in the town a while ago, but are discontinued."
": Can I scoop 'em all up and like whisper to this little poster, like we're gonna get you back up and running, Servo Sam, 'cause I know someone who can really use your help."
: Our casino.
": Yeah I was thinking Gunnie, but I mean, if your aspirations lie with the casino, you know, let's just get you back up and running and you can tell me what you want."
"Brennan: You a bunch of Servo Sam's krystals as you're getting the stealth device up and operational your ship is sort of floating outta the ship nursery sort of hovering over this kind of like canyon space, and this is the opening night of Barry's Big Win Casino. You guys have made a lot of friends in town you see Crunch Moon-Jones. As you walk aboard Crunch Moon-Jones walks and says,"
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Oh holy crap, you guys have a Jib-Job space on your ship?"
": Yeah, we do."
CMJ: I'm one of the founding members of Jib-Job.
: No way.
: Who's your daddy?
": My, oh you want to be?"
": He is the daddy, he is the daddy."
"Brennan: It kicks off, it's incredible, the whole night he's going around being like"
"""What's up, players? It's Crunch Moon-Jones here are Barry's Big Win Casino."""
: Hey this is great advertising.
: I love it.
: I do everything I like follow him and make sure he has the best time ever.
: We make sure none of us are in this video.
: Yeah he goes-
": Oh, that's true."
": Wait, we left Loose Duke."
": Oh, shit shit shit has anyone fed him?"
: He needs to be here for this. I go and I get Loose Duke to come to the opening.
: Oh my God.
"Brennan: You get Loose Duke, he's like,"
"LD: Man, this party's incredible, dude who's that?"
": Who, Crunch?"
"LD: Yeah, who's that guy?"
"Brennan: You go and turn to Crunch, you turn Loose Duke is gone, Loose Duke is fucking gone."
: Wait is he loose on the ship now?
: Who knows.
: Can I hunt him down and kick him off?
"Brennan: As you're, as you're looking around, I'm gonna need a group stealth check, if everyone would be so kind."
: What?
: Oh my God.
: 14.
: 12.
: 17.
: 18.
: 26.
: 26.
: 17.
: 17.
: Just having a little too much fun.
: 17.
"Brennan: 17 gotcha, cool, cool.You guys go you go to hunt Loose Duke down somewhere in the ship. It's, gang, it's chaos. You've basically effectively taken over the town of Baustin you've opened a casino, got a stealth mode on your ship. You're here with Crunch Moon-Jones, who's apparently one of the founders of this app Jib-Job or this like co-working space. You're now running around the ship. Aurora Nebbins gets excited. There's so many tortoises on the ship."
: Are they like cling to the side like barnacles?
: Are people giving the casino a bad rating 'cause we have a tortoise infestation?
: I know we put them in cute little cocktail waitress outfits.
: We can race the tortoises.
: Something else to bet on.
": You guys see, the next day, successful opening. Go ahead and roll yeah roll our first day."
: Okay we need to get fucking out of here after this.
: Let's get out here.
: 15.
: All right.
: What did we make?
: You make 350 credits.
": Big night, big, big, night."
: This was our big opening with all the rich people.
": Can I do insight to see how much Gunnie lost last night? Oh, I actually rolled really poorly."
Siobhan: Can I roll to see if I sold any pleasure putty?
Brennan: Yeah.
Siobhan: What do I roll? Just a luck check?
Brennan: Luck check.
"Siobhan: Great, I rolled a 13."
: 13.
: That's nice.
: Your lucky number.
Brennan: You get someone to sign up. It's 120 credits.
: That's great.
: Also all casino profits go into the ship fund.
": Yeah and then what, what do we pay out of when people win?"
: Probably the ship.
": It's not gonna happen, the ball is rolling uphill."
"Brennan: Towards the end of the night at the casino. You all look over and you see, wearing robes and looking translucent, pearly light you see Plug smiling from the corner and nodding."
: Oh my God. It's blessed by Plug.
: Wait and then the credits roll?
": Can we just all, can we all get in a line next to each other and look over at Plug and nod and wave?"
: Take a group shot with Plug?
": Yeah well, if you won't take a group shot with me, you better line up a group shot on that bar."
": Crunch, will you take a picture with us? Yeah we're gonna do a bunch of Kublacaine with a ghost."
: Amazing.
: But I think we need to get out of here.
": Yeah, I think so too."
: What makes you say that?
: I think we should stay forever.
: Let's do three more episodes right here.
"Brennan: Yes. All of you, you see Plug looks at all of you. Says,"
Plug: I want you to do one last favor for me if you can.
": Anything, Plug."
": Anything, Plug, you say it and we'll make it so."
: You're our best friend.
: The treasure you seek is buried underneath the Stuff Hut.
: Okay. I think we gotta go dig it up.
: Gotta go dig up the stuff.
: We gotta go dig up some stuff.
: We'll do a bunch of Kublacaine and go dig up the hut.
"Brennan: So it's super late at night the following the following malton unit you awaken you go out another scorching day Skiff Fest, it's like the big last day of Skiff Fest."
": Big, fun casino open."
": Wait, hang on, I think we should leave somebody on the ship."
Brennan: Raymond assumes that you're leaving today 'cause you've given him notice. so the Jib-Job workers are on the ship ready to depart.
: For security reasons Loose Duke is loose.
: Anyone who wants to gimme an investigation check and try to find Loose Duke.
: Absolutely.
: Barry feels so betrayed by Loose Duke.
": If we find him, he's dead."
: 16.
: So we've now flipped back.
": Wait, hang on a second I can cast probe mind and I can just walk around the ship and anywhere within 30 feet of me, I can hear him."
: I want him gone.
: I'm sure he is screaming.
: You do not feel Loose Duke's mind.
": Oh my god, we need him gone, he will destroy us."
: Can I smell For Loose Duke?
": Gimme, gimme a perception check."
: You think Loose Duke died in a vent?
: Oh no.
: God.
: Okay.
: 19.
: 19 you truly believe that Loose Duke is off of the ship.
": He just wanted to get away because we captured him and didn't feed him for like three days, which is on us."
Emily: I'm gonna do Loose Duke check every single fuckin day.
"Brennan: Now the following day, you guys head out to Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut. You arrive, do you dig into the ground underneath?"
: Very much so.
Brennan: You dig. I want anyone here to make perception checks.
: Are we going like outside the building or do we go into the building?
: It's a dirt floor inside.
: Okay so we're just going straight down.
: Straight down.
: 12.
: 17.
: 15.
: What's that?
": I, that I've rolled two nat ones in a row."
: Oh my god.
: Perception check.
: You roll so up and down.
: 17.
: 18.
"Brennan: Okay. So no one beat the 20, right?"
: I'll give a potent aptitude to you.
": 18\. Okay, four. A one."
: Oh no. But you don't you have your thing.
: 19.
: What did you get?
": I got 18 or no, I got, what did I? You got 18 so I got 17."
: Potent aptitude to you. I'll give everyone a potent aptitude.
: Come on baby.
: One.
: Don't you have your human defiance.
: That's saving throws.
: We'll dig again tomorrow.
": Oh, defiance."
": I don't think you, can you stack defiance with that?"
: Potent aptitude? Yeah you can.
": Oh, okay. I can use my- it's a new day, I can defiance."
: Yeah yeah absolutely. Okay.
: So what was that? That was a 19?
": You automatically get there, you get to 20."
: Another one.
: There you go.
"Brennan: Margaret, everyone else, so Barry. You're digging, as you guys dig as you guys dig on the outside of the hut. as you guys dig on the outside of the hut, you feel a box, the chest underneath the hut."
: What are you doing? You open it and Plug steps out.
": Wait he's in the box, how big is the fucking box?"
": Barry weeps, delirious from all the physical activity and all the drugs, he just weeps."
: Can I kick his knees?
": No wait, Plug, explain yourself."
: Taken a long rest.
": What happened, how'd you do this? What's been happening?"
: Is he spectral Plug or is he regular Plug?
": Hold on, all will be explained in time. He telescopes a little rod out, puts it up his nostril and pulls a completely empty plastic bag out of his brain, out of like up in his sinuses."
": I would love to do another persuasion check to have this man join our crew, because he rules."
: I will give the help action on that check.
: Are you still gonna die tomorrow? Is that still a thing?
: Always.
: Oh my God. All right.
: That's a 21 persuasion.
: Sorry what's that?
: 21 persuasion to get Plug to join the crew.
": You see, he puts a hand up, has to reach up high, to touch the metal face of the psycho drone."
: I'm always gonna be with you no matter where you are.
": No, our Obi-Wan."
: We kidnap him.
": Now here's why this is important you got a 20, right?"
: Yeah.
": You look out and see, what you think at first are clouds."
: Oh fuck.
"Brennan: They are not clouds. They're not clouds at all. They are structures cast reflecting the light of this system's star. There are multiple Amercadian destroyers in orbit around the planet, you begin to hear in the distance, a thrumming of large hover carrier craft. what Norman in the memory banks that Skip can unlock would recognize as troop carrier craft. You hear the blaring noise looking out in the distance you see carrier craft hovering across the desert, approaching Baustin with a flag, bearing the symbol of the Lone Star Directorate."
: Ah shit.
: We did technically sell their drugs.
: I think we've had our fun.
": Plug, we need to get out of here."
": Can I roll insight and see if Plug is Amercadian and if he's like putting us...? Oh, it was almost a nat 20… 11."
Brennan: You don't think that's it. Do you still wanna put Plug in a bag?
: Honestly? Yes.
Brennan: All right you put-
": Oh no, you put, can I stop her, contested grapple?"
: Just 'cause we love you. Just 'cause we love you. Okay. Let's get outta here before I try to steal him again.
"Brennan: You throw- Gotcha - Plug says,"
I appreciate you not putting me in a bag.
": No, I was just 'cause I really liked you."
": Plug, can you distract 'em?"
"Plug: I don't know can you,"
Brennan: And he throws you a pair of rocket boots.
Plug: I'll hold down the fort.
"Brennan: And he takes out the biggest cannon you've ever seen and he says,"
"Plug: You better scoot and boogie. I'll see you next time, sailors."
M: What?
"Ally: We sprint, right?"
"M: Just remember: it's today, not tomorrow so you can't die yet."
": Never can, 'cause it's never tomorrow."
"Brennan: With that I'm gonna need everybody here to roll initiative. That's all for this episode of Dimension 20, tune in next week for another thrilling episode of A Starstruck Odyssey. We'll see you in the stars."
: See you in the freaking stars.
: I thought we were gonna go out on a fun Plug moment.
: Oh my God.

"Brennan: Hello one and all! Welcome back to another thrilling episode of Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey. I'm your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan, with me as always are our Intrepid Heroes say hi, Intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, Intrepid Heroes."
Brennan: Last we left off: there's a new sheriff in town and it's...no sheriff at all.
: The gang-
": No, it's the cactus."
: That's right.
: It's the cactus.
"Brennan: It's the cactus now, throwing their old humble dungeon master for a big old curve last episode, Sheriff Warner Codge, the crooked sheriff of Baustin, New Texas had his head mounted on a cactus and our Intrepid heroes, the crew of the Wurst, The Gunner Channel, got to enjoy a little bit of Skiff Fest, mod up their ship..."
: With some really essential and important mods.
: Yeah.
: Yes.
: Did you mean the stealth?
": Yes, the stealth."
": That too, that too."
Lou: And the grand opening.
: And the grand opening of Barry's Big Win Casino.
: That was livestreamed to be on that choice.
": Will admit, with a planetary super computer on board and war about to break out on Rubian V, the gang had a fun time at Skiff Fest."
Ally: Gnosis in the back with like a flute of champagne sitting on it.
: Someone just left champagne.
"Emily: I mean, we definitely turned on Gnosis at like 4:00 AM."
: Best part of this casino.
": We all played Crash Bandicoot on Gnosis at 4:00 AM, it could do anything."
": Crash Bandicoot, we all take turns, one person at a time."
: It's a one player.
: One person game.
": Dude, I love the warthog level."
": You died, you died, it's my turn."
": So big casino opening, the gang has a tremendous amount of credits right now, but unanswered questions about the nature of Gnosis, what that could mean for Lucienne Rex and United Free Trade Planets, what that could mean for the history of the Griivarr Worlds and their funding of this Rubian Gnosis project, the Gnosis project, and with a ship fully refitted, reformed, refueled, and modified to be able to get its way back to the core of the galaxy you were kind of ambling your way out of town, but certainly got a fire lit under your ass when turns out, who knows what it could have been, could have been the absent drug courier Loose Duke, could have been you showing up in the background of Crunch Moon-Jones' Instagram feed, one way or another, the Amercadian Space Brigade that we already know has it out for who they believe to be Norman ""Skip"" Takamori, and is actually the cerebro-slug inhabiting Norm ""Skip"" Takamori. The brigaders showed up and now Baustin is crawling with them we rolled initiative at the end of the last episode, and we now zoom in to Talespire, where, but first thing I'll say, you remembered to talk to the Jib-Jobbers, who were all just safely aboard the ship, Princeps Zortch and Aurora Nebbins, happily hunting big horn tortoises."
: We're growing and learning.
": We're growing, we're learning."
"Emily: She would've been really helpful for this battle, but she deserves a day off."
"Brennan: We enter combat first to act in the initiative order is gonna be Skip, as you can see going to the board here."
"Ally: Zac, your thong."
"Brennan: As you all determined at the end of the last episode, you started to sort of beat feet because you're farther away from the Ship Nursery than you would like to be. However, you've just spent the past couple days skiff-ing. So actually going through town as it is now crawling with Amercadian Space Brigaders is maybe a less safe option than actually getting into the outskirts of town where you can grab a skiff and get there in no time. You have almost gotten to the edge of town. You're in a market, you can see here behind you is more market leading invariably back to the core of Baustin, where there are so certainly more brigaders and Lone Star Directorate soldiers coming in. Again, either on the advisement of Loose Duke, perhaps 'cause they saw the Instagram, perhaps because someone in the past three days sent a message to the dead sheriff of this town, any one of a million reasons, but the point is they're here and they're looking for you. I will remind you all, not only do you see brigaders on the ground, you also off in the distance in the haze of them being above atmosphere, they don't fill up the entire sky, but you can see them with the naked eye from the ground starships in orbit, brigade destroyer class spaceships."
: This is fine.
"Brennan: Now we: here's the thing, we had not actually determined whether you guys were trying to exit the city stealthily or whether you were sprinting out of town. I will say this, Skip, you are rushing through, get to this marketplace and you see, or actually gimme a perception check, your first to act in initiative."
Zac: Also could I use my bad feeling class feature?
"Ally: Yes, nice!"
"Zac: To like move forward a little bit, I actually don't have, I'm realizing I forgot to get that written down so I forget exactly how far I can go."
"Brennan: When you roll for initiative, you can move up to your speed, this movement happens before the initiative order is determined."
Zac: So I can go 40 feet forward before the initiative starts?
": Correct, yes, yes."
Zac: Okay. Yeah I'll make that perception check and-
Brennan: Give me yeah gimme a perception check.
: Oh God.
": No, you didn't."
: What was it? Nat 20?
: Stop that.
: Is it a nat 19?
: 21?
: 18 on the die?
: You got a 19.
": Nat one, cool."
": One second, one second. You need to-"
: 100?
": One second, you need to say it."
"Brennan: You don't see, you don't see shit. You're just, you're rushing forward. You can use your bad feeling to move 40 feet in a direction, if you would like."
: Okay.
Ally: Can any of us make a perception check?
Brennan: On your turns.
"Ally: Oh okay, cool."
"Brennan: I'll let you do it for free, but you must do it on your turn."
"Zac: Like, can I see those guys in front of me?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can see those guys in front of you."
"Zac: But on that nat one, I think Skip's gonna go try to kill one of these guys before the turn starts."
: I love that energy.
: Love the energy.
Zac: So I would like to move 40 feet forward.
"Brennan: Okay, I'm gonna move you 40 feet forward and then it's your turn."
"Zac: And then it's my turn, incredible. So I'm going to disengage, run through these people behind this guy in the doorway."
: Cool.
"Zac: And because he hasn't acted yet, I get advantage on this and if I hit him, it's a crit."
"Brennan: Incredible. This is going to be an acrobatics to move through here because they're fully blocking the door we're gonna need an acrobatics check, You can't, so this is : in other words, disengage is gonna help you, but it won't allow you to just push through there."
"Zac: Copy that, can I just fly over 'em?"
"Brennan: I forgot you have a jet pack, yes, you can. Fully can, that's no sweat. So you're gonna bonus action disengage, use your movement to fly over them."
: Just kind of like a cool jet pack cartwheel over 'em.
": Yeah, hell yeah."
: Real slow-mo shit.
"Zac: And yeah taking my first attack, and then I can reroll one of these because of Supreme Accuracy. Okay, that is going to be a 19 on the die. Or 19?"
"Brennan: 19 To hit, you hit."
"Zac: Okay, okay. I got 30 damage."
"Brennan: You deal 30 damage to that Lieutenant, they are still up."
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: Yes. You guys see all of you are running and with like superhuman speed again, in a body that does not feel pain, Skip just jet pack, somersault, land behind and back, and you just shoot the is dude in the back for 30 points of damage."
Zac: And how much movement do you think I have left at this point?
Brennan: You have 30 more feet of movement.
"Zac: All right, I'm going to jet pack straight up onto the wall above me, so I, so as to sort of disappear from these three guys, like just to try to go like up here."
"Brennan: You can absolutely fly up and just land on the wall with total cover crouching up on the wall. So yeah, you guys just see Skip rush the market, blam, and shoot up the wall behind these guards. Next in order's gonna be Sid."
"Emily: Okay so I'm getting the vibe that, okay, I'm looking at their names it's, there's a lot of skiff fans, so I'm actually just gonna go straight forward 20 feet then I want to Storming Shot, but I also did Capacity Boost so in the future I'll be able to take two attacks with my gun and I'm just gonna try to hit the guy that Skip already hit with my action."
: A 22 hits.
Emily: Okay. That is only seven damage. I'll use my reaction to throw the stun grenade at that crowd.
Brennan: Okay so the whole crowd just sort of around the door.
"Emily: Yeah, basically trying to get those three guys and it's okay to stun some innocent bystanders."
: Totally chill.
: They're just stunned.
: It's just a stun grenade.
": Take a nap. They've been doing a shit ton of Kublacaine, we're helping them come down."
": Incredible, okay."
Emily: So it's a con save.
"Brennan: Con save, you got it. All of the innocents there, so all the people just in the market, the Lieutenant, and the soldier to the Lieutenant's right, are stunned."
"Emily: Great, and then I think that's my turn because I did Capacity Boost and I am going to spend a kinetic die to boost my, boost my AC, and then I'm gonna dive behind, use the rest of my 10 feet to dive over for cover."
Brennan: Okay give me acrobatics or athletics.
"Emily: Acrobatics baby, 12."
"Brennan: Okay DC 10, you are able to dive to the other side. So you roller skate forward and leap to your left of the marketplace stall. That is Skip and Sid, both of these Amercadians over in the market who are interrogating this guy turn around and are going to take attacks on Norm, you have partial cover."
": Oh, right."
: All right.
Zac: Have we healed since that last battle?
: Yeah.
": We, yeah."
Murph: We've had like five days of ill advised bullshit.
: We are sunburnt from skiff-ing.
: We maybe had a little hangover.
"Brennan: You guys did a whole, a wholesale slaughter in the Slop and Gravy Bucket, and then, and then not neither ill advisedly nor good advisedly just sort kicked it in town for a couple days. Did some mods on the ship, we got the casino, just now the Amercadian Space Brigade is here."
"Emily: Oh, I'm so sorry. Also the guy that I hit, 'cause I used Storming Shot, he's also shocked until the end of my next turn."
: Okay and he's stunned by the grenade too 'cause you shot the Lieutenant.
: The Lieutenant was also stunned?
: Yeah the Lieutenant failed his con save.
": Okay okay, so he's stunned and shocked."
"Brennan: A hundred percent yeah, Skip, you take nine points of energy damage from that brigader. Both of them, they're gonna duck behind this tent over here to get cover and then the one dude remaining here is going to leap over behind this case. Ugh, cover's so far, and can this guy even get line of sight on Sid?"
: I'm hiding.
"Brennan: Yeah you dove behind the thing. Yeah that guy can't get any kind of shot on you. I'm gonna say that he, no, he's gonna take, you have three quarters cover, which is plus five to your AC."
": Okay. And I added two to my AC, so then my AC's currently 23."
"Brennan: Yeah, he's gonna take the shot if he can. That is a Nat 20, oh no."
: Damn.
Emily: And I don't have shield 'cause I used my reaction.
"Brennan: You take 16 points of damage. This Amercadian goes,"
"Amercadian: Sir! Not today, not while Amercadia's watching!"
Brennan: And leaps behind this crate.
Sidney: I'm gonna fucking kill you.
"Barry Syx: Yeah, you're fucking dead, loser."
Amercadian: I love my country.
: You're fucked. You're so fucked.
"Zac: Skip looks at the ground like am I, was that me?"
: Was that me? Was I that guy?
": Yeah, yeah, no that was kinda like you, yeah."
: Yeah you were like that yeah.
: Wow.
: You were a bit meaner.
": Yeah you were, this dude is at least loyal."
"Brennan: Big Barry Syx, that's gonna be you."
"Murph: Sweet : is there any world where I can, I basically wanna shoot a burst shot at this Lieutenant and this other guy in the doorway."
"Brennan: Both of them are down, fully stunned."
": Oh, they're down."
: So the doorway is actually fully clear right now.
Murph: Okay can I do with the perception check that none us can pass?
: Yeah.
: Nat 20.
: Oh my god!
"Brennan: Amazing, on a nat 20 you perceive, on a nat 20 you perceive that this could have been an entirely different encounter where you stealthed out of here, but we're well past that now."
"Murph: My prescription sunglasses go on, and suddenly I see so clearly."
"Brennan: Yes, there were three in the door, there were two interrogating over here. There's also a huge blast door over here, which would've been more important if you were like scootering or Aurora Nebbins-ing out of here, and there's another side door over here. So you basically see that there, there would've been other ways of handling this as it is right now, there is a huge blast door, you know, marketplace, yada yada."
Emily: Let's fucking get out of here.
"Murph: Is there, is there anything, can I see anything beyond the door?"
Brennan: What's that?
Murph: Do I see anything beyond the door?
Brennan: On a nat 20 perception I will say you see a yard of a couple different skiffs out there.
Murph: Rad.
Brennan: Past the blast door.
Murph: Okay. Can I kind of hold my turn until the rest of the crew gets through and I want to set up a situation where I wanna do an essentially an athletics check to like rip rather like a tent or like pull some kind of table and try to block that door just to give us time to not get blasted as we go away.
"Brennan: Oh hell yeah, so you want, do you wanna try to grab something that you can use to like jam up the door behind you?"
Murph: Yeah.
Emily: It's awesome.
Brennan: Give me a fucking athletics check.
"Murph: Sweet, Barry goes into the zone. Oh my god, 26."
"Brennan: Barry, you rush over and can fully heft one of these market tables. Just like-"
Barry Syx: Everyone get going.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you lift it over your head, any movement?"
Murph: I basically wanna hold my turn until those guys are through and then move through as much as I can.
"Brennan: You can so you go into the zone, which is bonus action, you heft the table, which is action. So you can, you can, in other words, take movement if you want."
Murph: Okay how far is it to the door here?
Brennan: Only actually about 50 feet.
"Murph: Okay, I can actually...sweet, okay. So I wanna get to as close as I can to the door and just be waiting and I'll just toss it."
Brennan: On your next turn.
"Murph: And I think with my bonus action thing I can jump over this wall, 'cause I think lower than 30 feet, right?"
: Oh my God.
"Brennan: So you're just like chugging down the market. There's like, you know, fruit and vases and shit shattering off of your table."
"Murph: I guess I've got the guys, can I kind of angle the table to give myself a little bit of cover 'cause I see the guys on the one side."
"Brennan: I will say, you know, on that nat 20 perception. Yeah, you are able to map the terrain out that you charge, and at the last second as these dudes, now here's the thing. Do you want to angle the table over your back for the guys you're running past hiding in the tent or do you want to angle it forward for the guard facing you facing you from the doorway?"
"Murph: Mm, I guess I'll, behind me for the two guys."
"Brennan: Cool so you're like, hey you, like a big horn tortoise, you like throw the table over your back to give yourselves three quarters cover as you sprint through the marketplace."
Murph: Rad.
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Emily: Nice moves, Barry."
"Brennan: Gunnie, that is gonna be you."
"Lou: Great, we can all get outta the marketplace, we're leaving right?"
: We're gone.
"Lou: Great, jet pack on 60"
feet straight out the door.
Emily: Yeah!
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yeah. No chance for any soldier to do any kind of thing. Full auto thrusters, just straight Rocketeer out through the doorway. Gunnie is off the map and outta here."
Lou: And headed towards the skiffs!
"Brennan: Headed towards the skiffs, you can get out of- 'cause I believe oh, it's activating your thing is bonus?"
"Lou: Bonus action, so then it's dash, it's: yeah."
"Brennan: In future as we move through the combat, you will now have your thrusters active, Riva, that's gonna be you."
Siobhan: I am also gonna do a runner and then...so movement and dash-
Brennan: Awesome.
"Siobhan: To the door, can I do a perception check out on this other side to see what's happening over here? I'm assuming that like we're not, this isn't the end of the fight we get out of the market and then we're done with this episode."
"Brennan: Perception yeah, gimme another perception check."
Siobhan: Great. Uh 19.
"Brennan: 19's pretty good. Those ships in the sky are not able to enter the atmosphere of a planet, they're too large. You see, you see twinkling of Brigade Tigers, lots of them, entering atmosphere. These are single pilot Amercadian fighter craft."
"Emily: Oh, I thought you meant actual tigers."
Lou: They just open a cage.
Ally: You see tigers entering the atmosphere.
Zac: They just fall instantly.
Brennan: So basically there are dozens and dozens and dozens of Amercadian fighter craft entering the atmosphere.
"Siobhan: Cool, in which case I might actually Quicken Power to bonus action cast Battle Precognition on myself so I have an AC of 15."
"Brennan: Hell yes, okay."
: Get that good AC.
"Brennan: Riva's got an AC of… Margaret, that's you."
Ally: Can I use my action to disengage and just run?
"Brennan: Yeah and actually you, no one's gonna get an attack of opportunity on you."
"Ally: Oh okay cool, then nevermind I'm just gonna dash out the door."
"Brennan: Hell yeah. So immediately what happens is Riva and Margaret just sprint Gunnie takes a second to auto up thrusters and blast out. All of you guys got the memo and are like, great we see the assignment, we're outta here. I love encounters where it's just get the fuck outta here."
"Siobhan: Get the fuck outta here, we don't need to deal with these people."
"Brennan: Be smart, get the fuck outta here."
Emily: Stun grenades are good for that. Especially for when there's innocent bystanders.
"Brennan: Yes, exactly, yeah you guys actually see, you are not being monstrous in this moment either. The Lieutenant that got stunned is badly injured, but still breathing, stable on the ground. Skip, that's gonna be your turn."
Zac: I shoot that man.
[cast laughs]
"Zac: I think we just gotta keep going, I'm gonna: from up here can I make a perception check for where the closest skiffs are?"
"Brennan: Absolutely. I would say you have your jet packs active, right?"
"Zac: Yeah and I'm still on that wall, so."
"Brennan: Oh, there's one within 80 feet of you."
"Zac: Okay, I'm going my movement and my bonus action to get to that and then maybe I don't know if it takes an action or anything to like get it going."
"Brennan: I would say, yeah, you see a pilot console on the skiff. You know how to pilot these things very well, if you go to one of the newer spherical skiffs, it'll be a hacker's check to get into its computer system. There are older ski mounted skiffs here as well that would be a security kit check to hack into or hot wire."
Ally: Which ones go faster?
"Brennan: They both go about similar speed, but it's basically like if you have proficiency with hacking you can get into one, if you have proficiency with a security kit, you can get into the other. Also, if you've got access to the engine, you could do a mechanics check to just try to bypass the ignition sequence at all and just like hot wire it."
Siobhan: And how many people can fit in each skiff?
"Brennan: Oh, they have full platforms so you can get-"
"Siobhan: Oh great so we can all get, we can all take one."
"Brennan: Yes these are, these are not like jet skis. These are more like pleasure yachts."
"Ally: It's like the bierfiets in Europe, where everyone's riding a bike, facing each other."
"Brennan: Yes, exactly."
Emily: Like pedal pubs.
"Ally: Yeah, yeah exactly like doesn’t look fun."
"Zac: I don't have a hacker, I don't have any of these kits. I have a demolitions kit."
Brennan: Gotcha.
: Blow it up.
"Emily: We're both, we're both good with hacking."
: Yeah.
Zac: Okay so I will just try on the other one.
Ally: Could you grab someone with your jet pack?
"Zac: Yeah if I could just drop down, well I don't think I can get there and do that. So I wonder if it's good to get one and then maybe I can pick you up on the way back."
Brennan: Gotcha.
Zac: But I'll try to go to the one that's got like the older vibe.
"Brennan: Cool, I dig it."
Zac: And can I make like an investigation check or something? 'Cause it's like with like expertise because of ships.
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it, give me an investigation check."
"Zac: 18 on the die plus like investigation sorry, that would be eight so 26."
"Brennan: 26 on the die, I'll call a 26 an even luck check. You want a higher number. 12. On that investigation you're like, okay hacking, and you see that there is a little bobblehead Cosmic Sister doll, you open it up - keys hidden underneath."
Skip: Right on.
"Brennan: [laughs] You guys hear a skiff- For Sid and Barry that are still in the marketplace, you hear a skiff starting up outside. Sid, that's your turn."
Sidney: Looks like my ride's here.
"Siobhan: Beep, beep."
"Emily: I think I'm going to take a dash action. But on my: I'm looking at these fighter jets, you know what I'm just gonna do it just 'cause, I'm going to, since I can, bonus action attack again, no, you know what? I think I'm going to basically use my action to dash, if I dash can I get out to him?"
"Brennan: If you move and dash, you can absolutely get out, yeah."
"Emily: Okay so I'm gonna do that, but to give myself extra AC, I am gonna shoot one of those, one of those stunned guys."
"Brennan: Cool gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. There are also still very- guys that are very much up and alive and, and dangerous."
"Murph: Yeah, this dude to the right is gonna shoot me."
"Emily: Okay then I'll go for that guy, I'll go for that guy."
"Brennan: Cool, go ahead and gimme an attack roll."
Emily: Just try to get the AC. Nat 20!
Ally: Nat 20!
Murph: That's the guy you said you were gonna kill who crit on you.
Emily: Really?
Murph: Yeah he crit on you and you just crit on him. He's got three quarters cover firing from-
"Emily: Crit for crit, bitch. That is 18 damage."
Brennan: He skids across the market.
"Emily: And it's actually an extra d6 damage because someone near him, another six, because Storming Shot someone- Oh no, I'm not using Storming Shot, never mind."
Brennan: Gotcha.
"Emily: 'Cause I used a bonus action okay so yeah 18 damage, peace out, fuck you. I'm gonna spend a kinetic die to add to my AC."
Ally: I smell a t-shirt.
"Emily: Four, baby. So, and then I fucking hop on the skiff and I say,"
"Sidney: What do you need me to do, Skip?"
Skip: Hang on.
"Brennan: Cool, that's gonna be the soldier's turn. They're gonna each take shots at Barry."
Ally: Barry.
"Brennan: And hit the table on your back. Barry, that is your turn."
Siobhan: Bring that table with you bro.
"Barry Syx: Sweet, this table rules!"
"Murph: Run and dash through the door, and kind of try to toss the table behind me, like set it, like kind of try to jam it in the doorway so that it's like cover or it'll take somebody a second to get through it."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, I'm gonna say give me a, give me an athletics check. I'll say like on DC 20 you badly hamper their ability to chase you, DC 25, you permanently like ruin this exit."
"Murph: Rad. Oh no, I did so bad."
Brennan: Oh no.
Murph: 12.
"Brennan: 12, okay. You rush through, throw the table in there. You create difficult terrain, but they're gonna be able to like come chasing after you."
"Murph: Cool, appreciate you."
: I think we need more-
"Murph: So if I move 60 feet, I can't get to the skiff yet, I assume."
"Brennan: You can't get the skiff yet, however as you get through the door here, you hear the brigaders seeing their Lieutenant down, do not pursue you in this moment. You hear them calling over the radio, however."
Murph: Sweet.
"Brennan: So they're going like say,"
"We have the traitor, we found Norman 'Skip' Takamori, he's on on exit with the proldier companions!"
Brennan: And you-
Riva: We have names!
Ally: We're the Gunner Channel.
"Sidney: Yeah I'm Sundry Sidney, the any: purpose droid."
"Skip: My name is Norman ""Skip"" Takamori."
"Barry Syx: I'm Barry Nyne, kill on-sight."
"Gunnie: Gunnie, proprietor of the Barry's Big Win Casino, which is now open."
Ally: We give them all drink vouchers to the casino.
"Gunny: So please come bring your friends,"
Lou: I just throw a shit ton of them.
"Brennan: Off in the corner you do you see like a rec station news hover van, like a skirting the outside of the city, like"
": Set up set up quick, quick, quick."
"Murph: Can I also, if I'm not at the skiff yet, can I use the bonus action"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
"Murph: Rad, I'll do that."
"Brennan: So you (grunt sound) through that, make it to the skiff. We're gonna go to the next board. In this next board everybody, we are onboard the skiffs, it is up to you because we are kind of splitting the difference between tactical miniature combat and ship deployment. So on your turn, turn to turn, you can determine whether you would rather use your deployment abilities or your character abilities. Only rule here is gonna be, you gotta, you cannot mix and match on your turn."
Murph: Got it.
"Brennan: So in other words, like if you're like for that round, it's like, if you commit to doing deployment stuff, you're gonna need to do for your reactions that turn, for your bonus actions, for your actions."
Emily: Are there anti-aircraft weapons on this?
"Brennan: Your skiff is not outfitted with weapons, so if you wanna be shooting weapons, you should probably stay in character momentum."
Emily: Gotcha.
Siobhan: I have a question about improved space casting.
Brennan: Yes?
Siobhan: Can I do improved space casting?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Siobhan: From the skiff?
Brennan: From the skiff you can do improved space casting.
Ally: Wow.
"Brennan: So as we move to the next board, we are going to begin with Gunnie's turn. You guys are being pursued by a skiff with a Lieutenant and also six soldiers. Those Amercadians rush the same skiff yard as you guys and you take off with them in hot pursuit. These are the skiff trails sort of outside the edge of town, as you can see this one goes through a thick trail of cacti, as you begin to zoom out over here, Gunnie, you are first to act. Amercadian skiff is, uh, barreling down right behind you, they're in a little bit of a newer spherical skiff you're in this older ski model back here."
"Lou: Great I'm gonna pop up like 10 feet, jet pack still active, and use one of my gadgets, which is just a classic oil spill."
Brennan: You're hitting the top of their deck with the oil slick.
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Copy that, okay."
Lou: More than anything I think I want to cover them in oil.
"Ally: And then feathers. Welcome to college, freshmen."
"Brennan: Yeah, exactly. We're gonna roll some saves for these fellas. [rolls dice] Okay, then copy that."
Zac: It's like Wipe Out.
"Brennan: Yes, you see three of these guys immediately fall prone as the oil slick hits that was your action, anything else from Gunnie?"
"Lou: Come back down, give a knowing nod to Sid."
"Emily: I say,"
Sidney: I got just the grenade for that.
"Lou: Perfect, and then I think that's my, what, that's action, bonus action, reaction? That's it, I think I come back down."
"Brennan: Okay, Riva, that's you."
"Siobhan: Oh lovely let me know if you're gonna let me do this, I say to the Skip,"
"Which is the off button, show me which is what the off button looks like."
Skip: It's kind of a different brand.
Riva: Just tell me what the off button looks like. How do we turn it off?
: The red one?
: I think it's red.
"Siobhan: Okay and I cast psychic push pull, just like I just like smash at all those controls."
"Brennan: Psychic push pull, and just start to smash controls on the ship?"
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Okay I'm gonna say, go ahead and give me, this is gonna be high risk high reward."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me-
Siobhan: That's what I love to do.
"Brennan: Yeah, what do you add to 'cause this is, this is you're trying to turn the ship off. So up to you, you can either take technology, mechanics kit, or piloting : all sort of the same."
Siobhan: Yeah I roll a minus one.
Brennan: You roll a minus one. You're gonna roll with disadvantage. You're gonna roll with disadvantage. It's only a DC 15 so you need both dice.
"Siobhan: No, no, no. That only a DC 15, so I need to roll."
Brennan: Two 16s.
Siobhan: Two 16s.
Brennan: Roll two sixteens. If you do this entire ship will immediately crash and we'll move to the next board.
: Wonderful.
"Ally: Let's do it, let's do it. Oh, wait, if you hold your action, I can give you advantage."
"Siobhan: Maybe I'll just do something else, that seems like a stupid thing to do."
: You can do like a-
Siobhan: In which case I'll cause psychic confusion on the guy next to the pilot.
: Okay.
"Siobhan: So wisdom saving throw, and I'll use heighten power to give him disadvantage on that."
"Brennan: Copy that. What do you, what are you confusing him about."
"Siobhan: Basically every action before moving on each of his turns, he has to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. So I'm just gonna have him shoot the pilot."
"Brennan: Incredible, wonderful, wonderful. You hit this dude. You see, he goes,"
"These interlopers are trying to get away, Lieutenant, I'm gonna kill you."
"Brennan: And the Lieutenant goes,"
What?
"Brennan: Incredible, Margaret, that's your turn."
"Ally: Great, okay, I guess I'm going to just boost the engines."
"Brennan: Hell yes, awesome, great, great, great."
Ally: And for me I can use intelligence instead of strength.
Brennan: Awesome.
Ally: Just the DC 12.
"And I add, I think, nine to this."
"Brennan: Or that's using the ship scores on a boost check, uses the ship's deployment scores."
"Ally: Oh, okay, cool. And what, what is the ship's?"
"Brennan: Add three to strength, so."
"Ally: Okay, cool, and what about intelligence?"
Brennan: I think the ship's intelligence
is a little bit worse.
Ally: Okay so I'll just use strength I guess.
Brennan: Yeah yeah.
Ally: So DC 12.
Ooohhh no.
That is a… 10. So I guess I'm gonna use Defiant on this.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
"Ally: Three, okay."
"Brennan: Okay, cool, the skiff gains 50 feet of speed."
Ally: Cool and then who's going next in the running order? Who's coming?
Brennan: It would go back to the top.
Emily: Skip.
Ally: Skip?
: Skip.
"Ally: Oh, cool then I'm gonna like really look at Skiff and pay- Skip."
Skip: My name is Skip.
Ally: Skiff Takamori.
": Norman ""Skip"" Takamori."
"Ally: I'm gonna be like, ""Skip, you're doing such a good job."""
: Thank you.
"Ally: And, and hone my Critical Analysis on him."
Zac: Is there a mechanical edge to this?
"Lou: It's just a compliment, just a nice moment."
"Ally: Instead of a wink this campaign, it's words of affirmation."
"Siobhan: I do feel like, with all this running away that we're doing, he is now called Norman ""Skip Town"" Takamori."
Ally: Yeah.
: Skip-town-amori.
Zac: Skip Town.
Ally: So you just have advantage that you can use on a roll. It can be any roll.
Zac: Oh hell yeah. Love it.
"Brennan: The Lieutenant is going to go on the back ship, and is going to rush forward and try to ram you guys off the course."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: This is going to be a strength check oh, sorry, you're also not piloting the Wurst so I forget we're not using the Wurst stats but that's okay. We're gonna say the skiffs add the same amount. So you do clear the check necessary to boost the engines here."
: Cool.
Brennan: This guy's going to rush forward. I'm going to need a strength saving throw from our pilot of the skiff here.
: Potentially.
: Watch out.
: Can I save that?
"Brennan: Unfortunately, oh no Riva you did, you are using deployment 'cause you have improved space casting."
Siobhan: I'm using deployment.
": Cool : watch out, great."
"Brennan: You add, you expend a power die and you can add that to whatever the saving throw is."
Zac: Just so a d6.
"Brennan: Yeah you can add or no, this one only has a d4 power die, skiff is much smaller than the Wurst."
"Zac: Okay and I'm trying to beat, sorry?"
Brennan: We don't know what you're trying to beat.
Zac: Okay I'm going just use that advantage I think so plus
Brennan: A d4 power die from the Watch Out.
: Nice.
Zac: So 16.
"Brennan: You see Riva as your psycho drone is there you yell, ""Watch out!"" Margaret, you're up there with the captain as well, you're like boosting the engines of this thing."
Margaret: You're doing such a good job.
"Brennan: And you hear shuttering thing as the sphere smashes back and you whip all the skis back into order and are headed for a massive jump as we move to the top of the next round. Skip, I am going to need a piloting check from you as you come to this huge, this skiff jump here."
": Oh, okay."
: My gosh.
"Zac: So my piloting it's, it's my piloting."
Brennan: It is your piloting we're using here.
"Zac: That was close to a three, but it's a 16 on the die, plus I believe eight or nine."
Siobhan: Oh my God.
Brennan: I know there's so many papers in this game.
Zac: Plus eight.
Ally: We did all have all of the papers.
"Zac: So 28, I mean 24."
"Brennan: 24\. You guys see the skiff get to the jump as you hear these hyon beams coming behind you, you hit the jump, the skiff makes the jump. You move a full 150 feet."
Emily: Can I use a reaction to throw a grenade? 'Cause I didn't use my reaction last turn.
Brennan: If you are able to throw grenades as a reaction.
Emily: Yes.
Brennan: Then absolutely.
Emily: Okay then I would-
"Brennan: There's no triggering event. There's no triggering event for the grenade, it's whenever you want?"
"Emily: I think it, I don't, I don't know. I'm sorry it's just fighting style."
"Murph: It says, “You can throw a grenade as a reaction.”"
"Brennan: Sorry, the wording is “As a reaction on your turn”."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: That is the so, so you can use your reaction to do it, but it has to be on your turn."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: So the ship, you can slow the ship down if you want, or you can attempt to try to get away."
: I don't think these guys are gonna leave us alone so like.
": Do you wanna like, hold it till after my turn?"
: We're about to go over this jump. I feel like they will try to catch up just immediately. We maybe we'll have the opportunity to do that again.
: Great.
Brennan: You can say push your turn after their turn in initiative order if you want to.
"Emily: Okay I will, I will."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: I just, I mean, Gunnie set it up so beautifully. I can't not light that birthday cake."
"Lou: As long as we can get back to Barry's Big Win so that I can turn a profit, that's all."
"Ally: Oh my God, we get there and you immediately just, like, bet max, bet max."
"Brennan: We're gonna roll this in front of the board, pilot check from the soldiers as the skiff comes after you guys."
": Beef it, beef it."
: Beef it.
: That is a seven.
: He beefed it.
"Brennan: You guys see the sphere take, so they do the ramp, the sphere takes off into the jump, but because they lost a bunch, basically when they hit you like billiard balls hitting each other, like you guys actually gained speed when they rammed you, and they lost speed when they rammed you. So the ball kind of rolls forward and *thunks* into the middle of the jump and they're gonna-"
Ally: Like Pooh bear?
Brennan: Yeah they just fully get stuck in the middle of the jump.
"Zac: And they're all covered at oil, so they will slide off and get cut in half."
"Siobhan: Sounds good to me, sounds correct."
"Brennan: But they are going to fire on you guys, who do they have line of sight to to fire on?"
"Zac: Oh, did I like, was my turn I made the piloting check, but did I get to do anything else?"
"Brennan: If you have deploy, you're sort of deployed right now, so if you have any deployment actions you wanna do, you're welcome to do that."
"Zac: Yeah I mean, I have this like Slippery Pilot thing that lets me as a bonus action dash."
Ally: [eyes widen] Oh-kay.
"Zac: So, you know, in addition to just like flying forward and with the extra speed and dashing, just like try to like get around a corner or something, just like lose line of sight on these."
"Brennan: Hell yeah if you just wanna foot, these guys, if you guys want to let these guys like dig their skiff out of the mud here, you can absolutely do that. If you just wanna just, if you wanna just hit the gas and bail, you can hit the gas and bail."
Zac: I just hit the gas and bail.
: Yeah.
Emily: Let's do it.
Siobhan: I do not care about any of these individuals.
"Brennan: So you guys see that like,"
Get them! [bomp] You'll see justice.
Riva: Who's justice?
Brennan: Yeah you tear outta here.
Sidney: They're so slippery I can just hear them all slipping on each other.
Ally: Two slippery pilots.
Brennan: Incredible. Let's go ahead and move to the next board.
: Wow.
: Wow.
"Zac: And do we have power die as this, like?"
"Brennan: Yes, you do, but they're d4s, it's much smaller. Go ahead and give me another perception check if you'd be so kind."
"Zac: That's gonna be, and that's just my perception, right?"
Brennan: Yes correct.
Zac: That is gonna be an 18.
"Brennan: So you're going through these skiff race tracks on the outside of town, the race tracks start to bend back around to head in, you can either take the chance to like head back towards town, basically like having gotten substantially closer to the nursery, or you can attempt to off road it to go straight from here to the Ship Nursery."
"Zac: I mean, are there any like jumps over there?"
Brennan: Jumps will be quite necessary.
Ally: Skip cracks like a sugar free Monster.
Emily: Sugar free.
Zac: [imitates turning a wheel] Just right towards the offroading.
Murph: I throw a pair of sunglasses to Skip.
Zac: Catch them on my face.
Lou: Just whip your face into them.
Emily: Are you wearing the sheriff hat?
"Siobhan: The Martini Nebula oversized T-shirt, purple sheriff hat."
Zac: My shirt's blowing in the wind.
"Brennan: So you guys take off another, another ski skiff is coming down the opposite side of the track from you and as you guys whip left to go off road towards the Ship Nursery, which you can now see in the distance, another skiff full of Amercadians is coming from the opposite direction, closes in behind you. Sid, you are gonna act immediately prior to them."
"Emily: Gunnie, should I hold my turn for you?"
"Lou: Ah, I don't think so, I think we're moving on."
"Emily: You know what fuck it, I'm just gonna burst on them twice and let's see where that gets us."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
: Incredible.
"Murph: Okay I think you can get everybody 10 feet, right?"
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Well it's not 10 foot radius.
Murph: Got it.
"Brennan: So it's, it's just a 10 foot square for the burst."
"Emily: Just a 10 foot square, okay. So I'm gonna go for whoever's piloting and then the people around them."
"Brennan: So you can hit like three of these guys, basically like the, like the first three."
"Emily: If that's the case, then you know what fuck it I gotta, I'm gonna use my last stun grenade on them as a reaction."
Brennan: Okay.
Emily: And that will hit everyone.
"Brennan: That will hit everyone, correct. Okay, DC for the soldiers here is gonna be 14 I believe, constitution save. Three make it, two are stunned. This is for the Lieutenant."
Zac: Beef it.
"Emily: What was it, was it a nat one? Was it a fucking nat one?"
"Brennan: No, it was a nine, which he beefs it. You see pilot is stunned, cannot take any actions, the skiff is moving forward with nobody at the helm."
"Emily: If he's unconscious then, and I hit him, don't I autocrit?"
"Brennan: You do auto crit, that's correct."
Emily: Okay I'm just gonna unleash on this fucking Lieutenant.
Brennan: Go for it.
"Emily: So, okay my first one, I forgot to use my weapon expert before so once I can just roll with advantage. Okay so that is a 20 to hit."
"Brennan: 20 does not hit. He's got three quarters cover behind the console even though he's stunned, he's got-"
"Emily: All right, fuck it. I'm gonna burst on him then, he can't save right? He's gonna auto fail."
"Brennan: Gotcha yes, absolutely. He auto fails, yep"
"Emily: Okay only six damage, and I will spend a tech point to give myself AC."
Brennan: Awesome.
"Emily: Should've bursted on him from the start. Oh, but I would've autocrit, that's why I tried to do it."
"Brennan: Pilot goes down, one of the soldiers leaps forward to the consoles."
Emily: Oh and then can I use my movement to hide behind big Barry?
"Brennan: Yes, you can. Okay, six damage to that Lieutenant, and if you're doing a burst, you wanna also have the other stunned guys there?"
"Emily: Nah, I kind of wanna do it on-"
Brennan: Just the?
Emily: On the awake ones 'cause the stunned guys are out.
"Brennan: Yeah, that makes sense."
Emily: So then like the other two guys next to him would take six damage if they failed.
"Brennan: If they failed, gotcha gotcha. They both make their saves. They duck down outta the way of the bullets, one of the unstunned guys leaps forward to the consoles, grabbing the controls of that skiff. The other two are gonna take shots at-"
"Zac: Can I use Colonian Turn? “When you are the target of an attack roll, you can expend a power die in attempt to maneuver out of the line of fire. Roll the die, take the results, multiply by 50”?"
"Brennan: They're firing at Barry right now, so they're not firing at the ship. If they miss Barry by 10 or more, I'm gonna say that the attack hits the ship and you can use that maneuver."
Zac: Okay.
": Wow, cool."
"Brennan: Both of them miss Barry, take shots. That's Sid, that's the soldiers, Barry, that's you."
Murph: How far of a jump is this other skiff?
"Brennan: Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ… Yeah, that's 30 feet."
"Murph: Just in case things get real bad can I like tie, like I realize I'll take damage if I like, when I jump back if I get like dragged or something, but can I like tie something or like throw it back so that-"
Emily: Can I just give him my rocket boots?
Brennan: Did you put these rocket boots on?
: I think you have 'em on.
: Yeah yeah.
"Murph: I'm going to, I would like to like object interaction, just like throw a rope or something."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Murph: To just have a lifeline back maybe, and then Barry's going to, I want to bonus action jump to other skiff and attempt to throw the pilot off of the skiff."
"Brennan: You toss a rope. You like toss a little grabbing thing from your belt leap through the air. It's not a hard leap 'cause both vehicles are shooting forward, you basically just pop up and let you know the air lift you to the other vehicle I'm gonna say, because these things are moving fast give me an athletics check first to get to the other ship. It's totally within range, call this a DC 15."
Murph: If I just like fucking die.
Zac: If this is how Barry died-
: It'd be so funny.
"Murph: I did roll at two and a three on my last athletics check, so nothing is certain. Oh rad, 24."
"Brennan: Okay, great. And now contested athletics you need to beat a seven."
Barry Syx: You're about to get fucked up Barry style.
"Murph: Oh my God, I only got a 14."
"Brennan: You leap, pick up the pilot, hurl him off the skiff. That Amercadian is gone. Gunnie, that's gonna be you."
Zac: Do they take damage when you land?
"Murph: Oh, they do take damage when I land, they take five."
"Emily: The stunned one if you land, you could probably land right in the middle of the stunned ones."
"Brennan: By the way yeah okay so yes. Yeah they're both, now the other two guys take five points of damage that are still up, all the stunned ones do as well. Gunnie, that's gonna be you."
"Lou: I look over at Sid, are we taking two ships?"
"Emily: I look over at Barry, are we taking two ships? I give a thumbs up."
Lou: Okay. well that I won't interfere with the ship then I think Gunnie's gonna fire off a tracer bolt at whoever has hopped into the pilot seat.
Brennan: Right now there's-
Barry Syx: I'm in danger.
Murph: Just screaming over the wind.
Gunny: You're gonna come back?
Barry Syx: Maybe I dunno.
Gunny: Okay.
Barry Syx: I think generally you could just do whatever you want.
: Great.
: Why don't we just throw you I'm next I think.
"Sidney: Oh, okay does everyone want this extra skiff?"
Riva: Absolutely yes.
Sidney: Okay.
Emily: Are they small enough that we can bring them aboard?
Skip: I love the drama of it.
"Sidney: Okay yeah we're doing it, yeah we're doing it."
Riva: It's less of a target if we have two things for them to choose.
Lou: Then I think I'll just give Sid the help action on her next on her attempt to board the other skiff.
Ally: Her future endeavors.
: Hell yeah great.
Lou: On future endeavors.
"Brennan: Riva, that's you."
"Siobhan: I will turn to Sid and say, you ready for this?"
Sidney: I think so?
Siobhan: And I psychically throw her onto the skiff.
Sidney: Waaaaaa-hoo!
"Brennan: Perfect, android pops up into the air."
: Just Predator handshake waiting.
"Brennan: Give me, give me the athletics check to get over there."
: Okay.
: I think it's like Dominic Toretto.
Emily: Can I do I have to use the help action here? Can I see what I get and then-
Siobhan: I'm psychically throwing why does she need to?
"Brennan: Oh, that's right, you're lifting. Yeah okay so that makes sense. Yeah you just lift up and toss, deposit Sid on the pursuing ship."
Siobhan: Great and then can I Quicken spell to psychic shunt this guy who has the gun? So he makes a strength saving throw and if fails he takes one d4 kinetic damage and falls prone.
Brennan: Fails the save!
: Takes two damage.
"Brennan: Takes two damage great, falls prone. There's one guy up, one guy prone, three guys stunned."
Zac: The absolute fray.
"Brennan: Margaret, that's gonna be you."
"Ally: Okay great, I am, well, I guess boosting engines isn't that smart 'cause we don't want to be way apart from each other?"
: Oh yeah.
Emily: There's a gun on this ship right?
Brennan: There is a gun on this ship.
: Okay.
Zac: Hell yeah.
"Ally: You know what I'm gonna actually put my phone on do not disturb 'cause this is getting really serious. I'm gonna offer the help action to Skip, and now I'm gonna train my Critical Analysis over to probably you."
Emily: I'm gonna pilot and then I think he's gonna take the gun.
"Ally: That's right baby, so I look at Sid, and you can't really hear me through all the wind, but I'm like,"
You're doing a great job.
Emily: I have never had so much positive affirmation.
"Ally: My hand is on Skip's shoulder as you're driving and I just go, ""You're doing a great job."""
Emily: I think Margaret read a book about management.
"Ally: I read ""Who Moved My Cheese?"""
"Brennan: Incredible. I'm gonna need a dexterity saving throw from Gunnie, Margaret, Skip and Riva."
"Ally: Dex, very cool, very cool."
Emily: Very rad.
"Zac: [groans] It was an 18 and rolled to a four. My dex though is pretty good, an 11."
Siobhan: I got a seven.
Zac: I'm like I'm gonna throw my Defiant on that.
"Brennan: Cool 11, 7?"
: 23.
Brennan: 23\. Margaret?
Zac: 13.
: Tres leches.
Brennan: What's that?
Zac: It becomes a 13.
"Brennan: 13 okay. Skip, Margaret, Riva, you all take 12 points of fire damage. The Lieutenant falling outta the ship goes to his vest, takes that an incendiary grenade, lobs it up."
Ally: Oh my god.
"Brennan: You are gonna take, you take six points of damage, give me a constitution saving throw as well."
: Wow.
Lou: That's gonna be a 15.
Brennan: Okay your body your cyborg limbs do not take damage that is unrepairable. We are back to the top of the order with Skip.
"Zac: I, there's a cactus in front of me, correct?"
Brennan: That is absolutely correct.
Zac: And I can't really like jump it.
"Brennan: You might be able to jump it there might be some, some functionality here."
"Zac: If they're behind me, I'm wondering if I should starship charge it and do I take a ram action on it? Just to try to like break the path."
Emily: Ooh!
Ally: Nice.
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Zac: So expend a power die to increase your damage on a failed save the target ship takes, it's a it's target ship I'm hoping I can do it on a cacti, takes additional kinetic damage equal to your, the amount rolled on your die plus your ship's strength modifier, which I'm not sure would it be on this."
"Brennan: Strength modifier on the skiff is only a plus one but starship charge is possible for you to deal enough damage to like help your friends out and like ram through this cactus, there is a fixed DC. You're making a strength check from here, but you also have the help action from Margaret."
Zac: Okay do I add the kinetic die to that roll or-
"Brennan: So you're gonna add a d4 and I'm gonna home rule that this is, you add a d4 both to the roll here and to the damage you deal as well."
Ally: And I would like to add another d4 with my Targeted Strike ability.
Brennan: Oh shit.
"Ally: Which is as a reaction, I expend a superiority die and I get to add that to your attack roll and your damage. So another d4."
Zac: So two d4s added to this?
Brennan: Yes. Absolutely.
"Emily: You guys just crash this whole thing in, and then you guys with your jet packs grab someone and then join us on this other skiff."
Zac: I do want to…
Emily: 'Cause it looks like it's on fire.
"Zac: Oh, we got an incendiary grenade tossed on us but that like our ship hasn't been hurt outside that, all right, I'm gonna roll this, two 12s."
: Nice.
"Zac: Plus one, plus two, so. 15 plus 1 is 16."
Brennan: 16 on the check through difficulty was 15 to break through this cactus.
Zac: We have resistance to whatever damage we take from ramming.
Brennan: And what's that it?
Zac: It gives you-
"Brennan: And you guys have resistance to whatever damage you take from ramming. You are going through at full speed. You're gonna add two d4 to this, and I'm gonna say that on ramming on this, you're gonna deal in additional four d6 damage. So two d4 plus four d6, plus the strength modifier here."
Zac: So plus one?
"Brennan: Yes plus one here, go ahead and roll damage."
Zac: 22 damage.
"Brennan: You guys look up ahead, see this like thing, like how hell is Skip gonna jump this? And you hear bam! You go through this cactus, rip it in half, which clears the way for the skiff behind you."
Ally: Nice.
Brennan: Go ahead and give me a piloting check also as you get outta here.
Siobhan: Watch out.
"Zac: Okay. I did, that's a 14."
"Brennan: As you push through here, you're gonna take some more damage from the basically like just, there's no way for you, you're trying to pilot through without hitting cacti on your way out, you take another 13 points of damage to the skiff as you move through."
"Zac: Oh, okay, cool. We're at 12 on the skiff."
Barry Syx: We got this one back here if you need it.
Skip: Sounds good.
"Brennan: Sid, that's gonna be your turn."
"Emily: Okay so I gotta try and pilot this thing, right?"
: Yep.
Zac: Is the path cleared for them though?
Brennan: Path is cleared so you will not have to make that roll for the cactus.
"Emily: So I have piloting, I have plus six to piloting. What does this, what does this mean? I've never been a pilot before."
Brennan: You're making a pilot check to just try to avoid all these cacti everywhere.
Emily: Okay and so I'm adding my plus six to it.
"Brennan: Yes, adding your plus six to it."
"Emily: And then can we say that 'cause Gunnie gave me the help action, can we say that he like whispered some stuff into my ear?"
Brennan: Absolutely.
Gunny: Okay here's some just quick basics with regard to thrust and gravitational pull.
"Sidney: Thank you, thank you, okay."
Gunny: Just remember all of that.
Emily: Okay that will be an 18.
Brennan: 18 passes the difficulty.
[Emily sighs in relief]
"Brennan: You see that basically Skip is like clearing this way in front of you and you're zooming as all of these cacti, like get hit by the Skip in front of you, go back and then start to sway back. So you're like watching them close up behind you as you push through this space, that is you taking an action to pilot."
Emily: And I am guessing that I can't use a bonus action.
"Brennan: Unless it's a pilot act, yeah you're deployed as a pilot right now."
"Emily: Great, thank you."
Brennan: Soldier here is going.
"Sidney: All right, Barry, we're all good."
Barry Syx: I think there's a guy that's still up.
"Brennan: Yeah, there's one soldier left, but the other guy was just took two damage was not prone. So the guy who's prone gets up, both of them are going to make athletic checks to try to push Sid off of the skiff."
"Emily: Okay can we at least say as a bonus action? I activated my rocket boots on my, when I was piloting."
"Brennan: Sure, I'll say that."
Emily claps.
"Brennan: First one is gonna go, Sid, you need to beat 14 on an athletics check."
Emily: [cheers] Fucking easy That is a 22.
"Brennan: 22, incredible. Second guy is gonna come after you. You're going to need to beat a 10."
"Siobhan: Come on, come on, big money"
"Emily: I didn't do, I got a six."
"Murph: Is there any, does anyone have human fortitude or any of that stuff?"
Ally: I have Heads Up which is for saving throws.
Emily: That's only a d4 as I could only tie it anyways.
"Brennan: You see both of these Amercadians rush up, you're taking the skiff, you successfully pilot it. You're coming out through after them and you see one of them grabs you, you elbow him off, the other guy says,"
": Not today, Droidy."
"Brennan: And tosses you over the side of the ship, and that is going to be Barry's turn."
Barry Syx: You fucked up.
Murph: I'm gonna grab that same dude and throw him off.
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
Murph: Nat 20.
Brennan: You punt that guy.
"Siobhan: Bye, bitch!"
Zac: He throws him so hard that somehow Sid comes back on.
Siobhan: Like a trampoline.
Ally: He bounces back up and knocks Sid in.
"Brennan: You like, it's like in pool, you call a bank shot, bank him off the ground, incredible."
"Murph: And then how far, so Sid has her boots activated, but she fell like where, is she roughly?"
Brennan: You are about halfway to the ground right now.
Emily: Okay.
"Lou: Barry, you can pilot, right? You got this."
"Murph: Oh yeah, totally. I'm gonna trust that Sid's gonna get back on somehow and I'm not even gonna look at the piloting controls, eh, that'll be fine. And I would like to essentially get into position where I am between where the pilot place would be and the other awake dude that could try to grab Sid."
"Brennan: Gotcha, you just looked muscle in between him there. Amazing, Gunnie, that's gonna be you."
Lou: Assuming we're not switching ships immediately. I'm gonna take my turn to try and patch this one.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Lou: I have a new ability with regard to patch that's not on my printed sheet?
Brennan: What's the name of the ability?
"Lou: I believe well, I think I need my mechanics kit, which theoretically I maybe don't have."
"Brennan: I think you have your mechanics kit with you. So yeah, you have advantage on the constitution patch check."
"Lou: Great, what's the con of the ship?"
Brennan: Plus zero.
"Lou: Plus zero, great, DC still 10 or is that?"
Brennan: DC 12.
"Lou: DC 12, great. Oh, that's not gonna do it..."
: Oh no.
Lou: ...but that is! That's 13. So I guess it's a d4 or what's the hull dice?
Brennan: The hull dice here are d4.
Lou: That's four points back.
"Ally: Aye, nice!"
"Brennan: Hell yes, heal four points of damage to the ship as you start to just get in there and fix the skiff while it is moving. Riva, that's gonna be you."
Siobhan: I'm gonna psychically bungee jump Sidney back onto the ship. So she goes down her hair touches the water and she springs back into the ship.
"Brennan: Yes there's a moment here of you guys racing through the desert on these skiffs, sand kicking up behind you. You get tossed off, suspend for a moment telekinetically, and boom pop back onto the ship on your roller skates."
"Sidney: Thank you, Riva!"
"Siobhan: And I'm actually gonna, I'm gonna quicken spell that so I can boost shields."
Brennan: Awesome.
"Siobhan: So it's a DC 12, it's plus three to strength right on this ship?"
"Brennan: This is not the Wurst so this is just a skiff, which would be plus zero this is a worse, worst kind of craft than your-"
Siobhan: It kept on hitting 12 and then rolling back to 10.
Brennan: Oh no.
Siobhan: Nevermind. I tried. I got Sid back.
"Brennan: Got Sid back. Boom, Sid goes back."
"Murph: We're not automatically gonna crash now, which is awesome."
"Brennan: Skip, that is your turn, you can absolutely clear off this part of the map."
"Zac: Yeah I mean, I don't wanna like leave them in the dust, you know, but like, continue forward."
: Yes.
: With the crew.
Zac: And I might take the evade action.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Zac: So like any attack on us has disadvantage and we have advantage on dexterity saving throws.
"Brennan: Amazing, that's gonna help you navigate these cacti absolutely."
Zac: And then the other thing is that our attacks from this vessel have disadvantage.
"Brennan: Okay, yeah yeah."
Zac: Just so y'all know if you're on our ship.
"Brennan: Yeah, 'cause you're like weaving so much that it's hard for people on the ship to get good shots off."
Siobhan: That's fine none of us to doing that.
"Zac: Yeah that was like with the people on this one, that's great."
"Brennan: Sid, that's gonna be you."
Emily: So a piloting check?
Brennan: Give me a piloting check.
"Emily: 25, 19 on the die. Woo!"
Ally: Nice.
"Brennan: Hell yes. Boom! You take off, you're right behind the Skip. There's only one soldier left. He is going to attack Barry, he hits Barry, deals you four points of damage."
Barry Syx: You absolute fool. It's like you wanna get thrown from a skiff.
"Brennan: You see, he looks at, you goes like point blank deals four points of damage he says, he goes,"
"Amercadian: Well, we'll see about that."
Brennan: And jumps off the ship.
[Murph laughs]
Emily: Can I throw a grenade at him?
Amercadian: Oh no!
"Brennan: You see, you guys tear outta there, let's move to the next board."
: Wow.
: All right!
"Emily: That was so anxiety provoking, fucking piloting check."
"Brennan: You guys arrive at the Ship Nursery. You've also, there are no more Amercadians pursuing you on skiff. You have successfully navigated the skiff sort of like encounter."
"Emily: Does the gun on our ship look like it could take a, like it could do real damage to like a ship?"
"Brennan: So the gun, the gun here would deal really serious damage to a person and would deal damage to a ship, but it would be pretty insignificant."
Murph: I guess I'll grab it if we-
Brennan: Yeah go for it.
Murph: Sweet.
"Brennan: So you guys skiff up as you are like sprinting to the nursery you see that you've, there's a bunch of Chesters out overlooking, you're sort like maglocked to the side of a canyon, a bunch of Chesters start looking at you, you know and waving as they've finished modding, the sort of stealth drive onto the engine, Lamelia looks at and says,"
"Lamelia: Well, hey there, friends, noticed you're in a hurry, seeing the big hullabaloo up there looks like-"
"Gunny: Yeah, yeah we're kind of, we're kind going right now."
"Lamelia: Oh, you gotta head out?"
Gunny: Yeah.
"Lamelia: All right. So let's settle up you've been here four days. We, and then we covered the docking charge on day one, so I'll go ahead and grab 120 credits off ya."
Gunny: Great.
"Lamelia: Thanks, pleasure doing business."
Gunny: Oh yeah did we tip the Chesters?
": Oh yeah, tip the Chesters."
: Hurry!
": Here you go, Chester!"
Ally: Some Kublacaine to each of the Chesters.
Brennan: Every Chester has a tiny little bag of Kublacaine that they have no means of ingesting. You see Lamelia--
Emily: Sell it! Be their own boss.
"Brennan: Yeah you see that Lamelia looks at them and says,"
"Lamelia: Fellas, that's worth money if you want to sell it."
"Brennan: And you see that all of them look up at you for giving the little baggie and each hold it to their as, and cross their hands, and they all go. They all go put it on their little work cubbies."
Emily: I rip some wires outta the ship and make little necklaces so they can wear it.
Brennan: Cool.
"Gunny: Sid, we don't have time for crafts."
"Brennan: Barry, you grab, you grab the skiff cannon off otherwise getting these skiffs on board you guys can see it'll take a couple of minutes to get like the lifting machinery up to get these skiffs off."
"Lou: So a couple of time, a little bit of time for necklaces or bracelets."
Emily: Okay so I spend my time making-
"Murph: Do we wanna, are we gonna bring the skiffs on?"
Lou: Are we bringing the skiffs on?
"Zac: Does, can we make a perception check to see if that feels like."
Brennan: Give me a perception check and it's related to ships so do it with advantage.
"Zac: Okay, good 'cause that wasn't good."
"Lou: Yeah, do they sink down?"
Murph: We can keep the gun.
Siobhan: I got a 21 perception check.
Brennan: Those Tigers are closing in.
: Yeah let's get the-
Emily: Let's just grab the gun. Can you psychically pull this gun?
Siobhan: I am so low on spell points.
Murph: I've got it.
"Zac: I'm gonna yell,"
"Skip: Gosh, I hope Loose Duke doesn't take a free skiff here."
Brennan: He's gonna roll a luck check in front of the board.
Murph: He's dead.
Siobhan: He's dead in the vents.
Brennan: That's a four on the die.
"Emily: That's his luck, right?"
Brennan: What's that?
Emily: That's his luck.
"Brennan: That's his luck saying I hope Loose Duke doesn't take one of these skiffs. We cut to somewhere else in Baustin where Loose's skiff has been hit by one of the fleeing police cruisers. ""Man, come on."" Loose Duke is nowhere around."
Emily: He's not on our ship?
Ally: We will never convince Emily.
Brennan: We will never convince-
"Lou: I mean hey, that's the best news."
Murph: The Porter of this season is Loose Duke is on the ship.
Emily: Can I do an investigation to see if he's on the ship?
Brennan: Yeah go for it.
Emily: Oh my God.
Lou: I'll give Sid the help action.
"Emily: Okay, 23."
Brennan: 23.
Lou: Do you want potent aptitude just in case?
Emily: Yeah.
Lou: No.
Brennan: Okay on a 23 you search the ship and don't find Loose Duke.
"Emily: I need to crit to know, I need to crit."
"Ally: If I crit, can I please find Loose Duke on the ship?"
Brennan: Yeah go for it.
"Ally: Two, two."
Emily: So close.
Ally: So close.
": So close, so close."
Ally: So I don't find anybody's on the ship.
: Start the ship.
": Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, you rush to the cockpit, psycho drone finishes up. Riva, you can like stash your psycho drone, everyone else. So you abandon the skiffs behind you. You get the gun off one of the skiffs."
Siobhan: Is this taking a minute? Is this in time taking one minute?
Brennan: I would say yes.
Ally: I think I would love to do something in that minute also.
"Siobhan: I would like to give an inspiring display. It's called inspiring display to the ship, which I think just means doing a fun underwater dance."
Emily: Do a campy dance.
Ally: A campy dance.
Siobhan: Let's do a campy little dance which gives plus five temporary health points.
Skip: Is everyone dancing?
Siobhan: And also two people get a d6 to add to one roll whatever they please. So I'm gonna choose the important people to have that. [gestures to Lou and Zac on either side of her]
: Yes.
Lou: Makes sense.
Brennan: Hell yeah love it.
Emily: Can I use my minute to pick the pockets of the stunned guys on our skiff for a grenade?
"Brennan: Oh yes, yes you can."
: Do I find anything?
: Are they still on the ship? Can we throw them off?
Brennan: Give me an investigation check.
"Emily: Nat 20, baby, okay… 21."
"Brennan: The Lieutenant was thrown off way, way back, but they each have a light blaster pistol on them."
Emily: All right I'll take those. That's ammo. It's ammo.
Brennan: It's ammo.
"Ally: I can I take a minute and look at everyone in the eye and be like,"
Margaret: Get nasty.
Lou: Get nasty.
Zac: This is a spell or?
"Ally: Get nasty, no, this is just for me. I want to get my enunciation down, but this is I'm casting sage advice."
Brennan: Copy that.
"Ally: And just passing my knowledge and experience while advising those around me, so getting nasty leads to great results, and then I would love to, can I do a luck check 'cause I'm next to a slot machine? Like everybody get nasty and then hit the thing."
: What was that?
Ally: Tres leches.
"Brennan: Tres leches. Cool, you say get nasty, bar cherry lemon."
Margaret: Am I right?
"Emily: I am gonna manifest my ideal of the tranquil to get three tech points back, and then I'm also going to right before I get into my thing manifest my explosives style, oh, explosives mastery."
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: Can I start making AstroNav checks?
"Brennan: Yes you absolutely can. I'm gonna say it takes couple of rounds, so you loot get up into your gunner spot here. We're doing a lot of things other than just running into the ship and taking off, which is okay."
Emily: We are taking a minute yeah.
"Brennan: You are taking a minute. So we're gonna, I'm gonna make two luck checks. You really don't want a one through five on either of these. It's an eight."
Lou: That's not five.
Brennan: That is a four.
Lou: That's less than five.
"Brennan: So you're getting into your cubby, you have the grenades, you've got the stuff aboard. You've done the inspiring display. You can make one AstroNav check."
"Lou: That's a ten, is that plus my intelligence?"
"Siobhan: Oh, and you roll with disadvantage."
"Emily: Oh and know that you always have Handy Annie, when with you, when we're on the ship."
"Lou: Great, we'll take that as a flat 10 plus five, 15."
Brennan: You get one equation before the Tigers show up.
"Ally: Okay look, I look, I dunno what to tell you, Brennan, but I, I want everyone to have my intelligence modifier added to something and I'll let you know what that is maybe it's lore."
"Brennan: Could be, could be."
Lou: I'd like to know a fairy tale as we get blasted.
"Brennan: All right, let's go ahead and move to the next board."
Ally: These Tigers are pretty small.
Emily: Yeah. Ooh let's ram them.
Siobhan: Good idea.
Zac: We're running from them.
"Emily: True true, true."
"Ally: No, that's what she was saying, let's [pronouncing it more like “ram”] run."
: Let's ram.
Ally: Let's run [“rem”] from them.
"Brennan: So use again, using the stats for the Wurst, we're gonna roll ship initiative versus Brigade initiative."
Zac: 10 on the die becomes a nine.
"Brennan: As you take off, racing through the atmosphere, displacing clouds for miles around a orbit to surface laser about as wide as three or four city blocks, races overhead and scours about a quarter mile scorch mark in the desert. And also these Tigers are coming in behind you as you pull away from the nursery, that beam is gonna do serious damage, it could eat through your shields pretty rapidly. Now you need to get outta here, but you don't have the completed checks to be able to do so to like jump to faster than light right? But these Tigers are gonna get you unless you can flee, but if you flee up into the atmosphere, you're completely screwed. So you see a series of canyons opening up ahead of you that allow you to like get away from these Tigers and not be exposed to those orbital lasers."
Skip: This is skiff racing.
Murph: Now this is skiff racing.
"Brennan: These ships are going to go. The Tigers are going to go first, you start taking hits to the ship's shields."
"Zac: I think I will do a snap roll, well, there's nowhere I can go to where they can't see me. So I will do a snap roll, expend a power die and attempt to roll to mitigate damage, when you do so the damage taken from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die."
"Brennan: So there are a bunch of attacks incoming, you let me know which attack you wanna react to."
Zac: The one that's like doing the most damage. I'll do the first one.
"Brennan: Cool, I dig it. Here we go. You take nine points of damage to the ship and the ship's speed is halved as it hits the engine. The ships-"
Zac: Can I roll the d6 to see how?
Brennan: Yeah roll the d6 to see.
Zac: Six.
Emily: So we only take 3.
"Brennan: Take three points of damage to the shields, but your speed is half with the crippling shot. Next attack is gonna be another nine damage to shields. Next attack is going to be 10, 14, shields on the next one. Next deals seven points of damage, and then that's gonna be another 23 points of damage."
Siobhan: How many attacks do these bastards have?
Brennan: Then I'm gonna need two dexterity saving throws.
Zac: With the ship's dex?
Brennan: With the ship's dex.
Zac: 13.
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: Watch out on that 13.
Zac: So a d4 or d6?
Siobhan: d6.
Zac: So add four to that so 17.
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: You think they're just gonna get to go till we die or?
"Siobhan: That sounds about right, this is where we die."
Brennan: Another 13 points of damage.
: Jesus.
[whistle]
Murph: So they were each taking two attacks?
"Brennan: They were each taking two attacks. Yeah these are incredibly dangerous vehicles chasing you. It is now the ships' turn, looking down the canyon you have a long straightaway I don't know if you can see, there are several skiffs jumping the canyon here."
Zac: Are they like enemies or just dudes having fun?
Brennan: They appear to be just dudes having fun.
Siobhan: Oh good for them.
"Ally: Oh, that's great."
Lou: Happy for the dudes.
Brennan: Also some skiffs at the sort of the base of the canyon as well.
"Emily: Would, can we get cover with our ship though?"
"Brennan: Very slim partially, if you wanna try to put some of these things in between you, you can, but bear in mind, your speed has also been halved."
: Do we?
Ally: Can we roll to get out of that?
"Siobhan: Yeah, is there a fix?"
Ally: Like a save or something?
Emily: Like a speed booster or something?
"Murph: Do we, so these things are definitely fast and they seem to do a lot of damage, would we know like how sturdy they are?"
Brennan: Not exceptionally sturdy.
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: These are like single pilot fighter craft.
Murph: Should we just try to shoot these fuckers outta the air?
Emily: Do you want us to try and shoot them?
Zac: Could I just like slam on the brakes and just do a ram?
Murph: Ram the dudes behind us?
"Brennan: That will be a deep powerful commitment to like fighting this out if you want to do that, but you are welcome to do so."
Zac: 'Cause it's like-
Emily: We do still have 58 hull points. We have 16 shield points and 58 hull points.
Lou: Did we regen?
: We have plus five to that hull point as well.
: Yes actually.
"Lou: We get the hull dice back and we need the, or we get the power dice back and we regen shields."
"Brennan: Two, two shield points"
regenerate at the start of your-
Ally: Can we do a roll to check the scanners and see if these are three Tigers of many? Or if these are the only three Tigers.
Zac: There's gotta be hundreds right?
Brennan: There's tons of these.
"Zac: Well, I'm gonna use my Slippery Pilot to dash forward."
Brennan: Cool.
: That's good.
Zac: We'll dash forward the ship's speed.
Emily: Can we shoot before you do that so that we don't get outta range?
"Zac: Oh, right, I forget that we all."
"Brennan: Yeah all your ship is acting on one action, so if the gunners wanna go first to see if they can give, give info to people."
"Emily: Okay… Sorry oh, I have a five, so that's a dirty 20 to hit one."
Brennan: Dirty 20 hits.
"Emily: Okay I'm going to expend a kinetic die to add a d4, plus three : nine energy damage."
"Brennan: Amazing, nine energy damage, still up."
Emily: Okay I'm going to spend a tech point because now I can spend it's a Sentinel thing. I can spend a tech point to use a bonus action to do a second attack.
Brennan: From your deployment?
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Absolutely, go for it."
"Emily: And can I use a power die on this if I hit? Okay that's a nat one, but I reroll that. Okay does a 15 hit?"
Brennan: 15 hits.
"Emily: Yes, I will, I'm going to do Distracting Shot to give you advantage. [gestures to Murph] So I just, do I add the oh yes. So I add a power die so it's another d4."
"Brennan: Oh, sorry, d4 for this ship are d6s."
"Emily: Oh, it's a d6 okay."
"Brennan: D6, yeah, yeah."
"Emily: So I'll do the d6 and I'll do another kinetic die actually you know what? I won't do a kinetic die here. I think I'll be able to take 'em out with, well, I will do it just to be safe. Six, nine, another 12 energy damage."
"Brennan: Oh, you've done 21 all told. The Tiger in the lead behind you, you (cannon firing) quad hyon cannon going, you chew through its shields permanently incapacitate shields and its hull is in tatters but it is still flying behind you."
Emily: Okay but you can work with that. [pointing at Murph]
"Murph: Yeah all right, can we say one of the things that I had prepped was just to go into the zone right before battle?"
Brennan: Sure.
"Murph: Sweet okay. So in the zone, I'm gonna take a shot at the injured one. I have advantage because of Sid. That's a crit with a 19 because of the new level up."
"Emily: Oh, right!"
Brennan: Hell yeah.
: I forgot about that.
: So that is going to be.
: You crit on 19.
: You crit on 19.
: 4d4
"Emily: And since he crit, can we use another power die? Although wait, you're using it on this other guy so we should save it."
"Ally: Do it, I can use my superiority die instead of power die on my turn."
"Emily: He has a bonus action to, to attack again if he downs someone."
Murph: 15 damage.
"Brennan: That first Tiger that got you guys. The one that hit your engines and slowed the ship, boom, fire along the canyon side, first Tiger is down."
"Murph: I will bonus action explosive shot, when you reduce the ship to zero points, you can expand one power die and use a bonus action to make an additional ship attack."
: Go for it.
"Murph: That was only on my next attack I got advantage, right? Not my whole turn, just the one? Okay, hoping for the best. Should I do? What are we on power die?"
"Lou: Two, go ahead."
Murph: Should I do one again?
: Yeah.
: Yeah.
Murph: Okay.
"Siobhan: I'll direct you, so you get advantage and actually-"
"Murph: Oh, sweet."
"Brennan: Riva, up on the bridge, goes into comm system and gets the ship to focus target on that last thing, bringing the belly of the ship up boom. You get advantage on this attack roll."
Murph: Nat 20.
[cast cheers]
"Brennan: Oh my God, baby."
"Emily: Oh my gosh, and now you can add a power die to it. So now you can add two d6 we have a chance."
"All: Crit, crit, crit, crit."
"Murph: So I'll do a Precision Shot to, so I'll expend a power die to add two d6 to this."
"Lou: You spent two on your turn, right?"
Emily: Yeah I spent one.
"Murph: I only spent, I spent two of my turn. You are correct."
"Emily: I spent one, he spent two."
: All good.
Ally: I'm not doing anything with the die.
: You have a d4?
Ally: I'm just gonna boost the engines.
Lou: I have a d6 now as the reactor thing so.
: Come on baby.
: Come on baby.
": High numbers, high numbers."
Murph: Oh pretty good.
Lou: Chop chop.
"Murph: It's not gonna kill him I don't think, 20 damage."
Brennan: You do chew all the way through the shield. Shields are down on that Tiger as the squadron forms in behind you.
Ally: Each Tiger has 20 shield points?
"Murph: Actually, you know what instead of Precision Shot, I'll do the slowing shot, the one that's halves their speed 'cause that still adds to damage anyway."
Brennan: Copy that.
"Murph: So speed is halved, and they're super damaged."
"Emily: Can we do it since he crit, can we do it that it goes sideway."
"Brennan: Yes yeah that one gets slowed, nose gets taken off to the side. 20 points of damage to that one. We have a direct action from the comms station on the bridge."
Ally: I would like to boost engines.
"Brennan: Boost engines, let's go."
Zac: If I needed to use a dice eventually would that be all right this turn?
Lou: This turn?
Zac: Or as a reaction.
Ally: I hit the DC.
Brennan: The DC?
"Ally: 13, and I needed a 12."
"Brennan: All right, cool. This ship speed moves up to 200 so we go from 150 halved to 200."
"Emily: Oh, awesome."
Zac: And then I am using Slippery Pilot to do a dash as well.
Brennan: Awesome.
Zac: So that would be another?
"Brennan: 400, you'd go 400 feet forward, awesome."
Zac: So we fly 400 feet forward.
"Brennan: I am gonna need a piloting check as you navigate through these. Let me ask, as you are navigating through these gambit situation, risk reward, you can fully make a piloting check just to avoid everything and be safe, you can also play it dangerously to time this in such a way that as the Tigers are pursuing you, you are putting your ship in danger in order to give the Tigers even less time to react as they fly in behind you."
"Zac: I gotta do that. What, what are we doing if I don't do this? Sorry. So what does that mean again?"
"Brennan: That means that you're gonna be rolling this piloting check with disadvantage. You are just trying to hit a DC 15 to avoid right, to avoid this."
Ally: Have you already gone?
"Lou: No, not yet."
Ally: You have something that you're gonna do.
Lou: I'm just gonna boost the reactor.
"Ally: Oh, okay."
"Brennan: Okay. So you're trying to hit a DC 15 pilot check, you're rolling with disadvantage, if you do all the Tigers behind you are gonna have to make savings throws or hit these skiffs."
Ally: What's your plus to piloting?
Zac: My plus the piloting is eight so I have to get-
Brennan: You gotta get seven or higher on both of these.
Zac: I got a two.
Brennan: As you are piloting going through here doing your pilot check it's just a straight shot forward.
Ally: Do you have anything for that?
"Lou: Well, you've got the d6."
"Siobhan: It's, oh yeah I gave you a d6 before."
: You can use that d6.
"Zac: Oh, can I use that d6?"
Siobhan: Yeah you can use it on anything.
: Two plus eight.
"Zac: Yeah, I haven't used it."
Murph: You need a five or higher.
"Brennan: You have a d6, five or higher, this is gonna be Box Of Doom, hold on."
"Siobhan: Come on one in three chance, one in three chance."
"Brennan: One in three chance, five or six."
: Guaranteed.
"Siobhan: Guaranteed, guaranteed."
Brennan: Five!
[cast cheers]
"Brennan: Ooo, baby, there it is! You see, yeah you start heading through. Skip, you're in the pilot's chair going through, Riva, you have your focus like on the gunners headed back and you just suddenly feel all a psychic wash of ""Woo! Chuck, Chuck, we're gonna make the jump bro."" And whip around, hold a hand out and hit you feel a wave of psychic energy from Riva and skid, you take just enough shield to scrape the tail of the Wurst along the canyon wall and give yourself three jumping skiffers behind you as you sail through, let's move the Wurst 400 feet forward down the track."
: Ooh.
Zac: Oh my God.
Ally: Hell yes.
: We love to see it.
"Zac: In the veins, shoot it into the veins."
"Brennan: Hell yes. The Red Hot rockets down the straightaway in the canyon, as you do you see up ahead that the canyon begins to pretty wildly switch back."
: Okay.
"Brennan: Back and forth. The Tigers are coming after you, they don't wanna fire at long range and they are too far away they don't want disadvantage. So they're gonna stay on your tail, three of them are still at full speed. one of them is halved. The three at full, oh yeah sorry."
"Lou: Before they go, I'm just gonna boost our reactor and make a quick AstroNav check."
Brennan: All right let's go for AstroNav.
Lou: AstroNav is another 15.
Brennan: Another completed equation.
Lou: Reactor is plus five so that's gonna be-
"Emily: Yeah, that's great."
"Lou: So we're back up to full, but that also means that the ship takes that many hull points of damage so-"
Emily: Why?
Brennan: Gunnie's boosting the reactor to a dangerous point to produce that many power dice. So a hull point of damage.
"Lou: And then constitution saving check, plus the number rolled on your tech die so that's a 15. We save on the constitution. So just the one point of damage, but we're back up to full power die."
"Ally: Okay, great, great."
Brennan: You hear a scream coming from within the reactor.
Skip: Gunnie's dead.
Barry Syx: Loose Duke!
"Sidney: Handy Annie, Handy Annie is he okay?"
"Gunny: I'm fine, sorry."
"Riva: Who inherits that debt, who gets that?"
Skip: Initiate chest compression.
Ally: Who gets to roll for a speed back?
"Brennan: That would be a repair check, so the mechanic could do that or there's different people that could do that to get your guys' speed back up."
Siobhan: Can the Princeps do that?
Emily: Or Raymond?
"Brennan: No, neither the Princeps nor Raymond Zam may make that check."
"Siobhan: Well, it was worth asking."
"Brennan: The Tigers are gonna come in after you guys. There are three skiffs jumping, I'm gonna roll in front of the board for fun."
Ally: Boy oh boy.
"Brennan: These guys have good, these guys have good dex, they save on elevens or higher."
Murph: This is to not crash into Crunch?
Brennan: Yes this is to not kill Crunch Moon Jones.
Ally: Are you rolling three dice per each?
"Brennan: Per each, unless one of them, you know takes it out right? So here's the first save. That is a three."
Siobhan: Nice.
: It's gonna crash into the skiff.
: Killing.
Ally: Crunch Moon.
"Siobhan: Crunch, our boss slash tenant!"
"Brennan: You see one of the Tigers just mows through boom, fully loses its shield, takes hull damage, as that skiff blows up, but it is not down and out. Next skiff… Nat one."
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: One of the full health Tigers direct rams a skiff and blows up.
Ally: Captain!
Barry Syx: You guys all right?
: Yeah I don't know how to feel.
Barry Syx: Everybody all right back there?
"Brennan: All right and another skiff on the last one fully chews through its shields again, you see, as you are just weaving through, (energetic spaceship piloting noises) as these Tigers just cannot avoid these skiffs behind them. And then that slowed Tiger in the rear coming up. So there's three Tigers left. Both of the ones in the lead have taken damage, there's another one that's also taken damage that is following up and is having a hard time in pursuit. However, those two in the lead are gonna take shots on you, I'm gonna need two dexterity savings throws here."
Zac: Okay.
Emily: You got this.
Murph: [manifesting] Nat 20.
Zac: Seven.
Brennan: Copy. Cool.
Zac: 12.
Siobhan: Watch out on that 12.
: Okay d6.
: D6.
Zac: 12 becomes 14.
"Brennan: Okay, you dodge one of them with the help of that Watch Out and take nine points of damage. Okay, that goes back to the ships' turn."
"Ally: I have a question about one of my disruptions, it's hacked communication so I use my action, I use a power die and it's ships that I"
can see within 600 feet have a wisdom saving throw or else their like communications are disabled?
Brennan: Yes.
Ally: Until they reboot?
Brennan: Yes.
Ally: Could I do that to the giant ones?
"Brennan: The range on that is 600 feet, right?"
Ally: Yeah. You don't think we're-
Brennan: Yeah you are not within 600 feet.
"Ally: Okay okay, cool I'm just gonna boost engines again then."
"Brennan: All right, copy that."
Emily: Do we wanna start with us trying to hit these guys?
"Zac: Sounds good to me. I mean, can I make a perception check? Just to see if there are more like, about to be here or anything like that or?"
Brennan: Give me another perception check.
"Emily: Yeah, like what's ahead."
Zac: Yeah… that would only... that's my perception?
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Zac: Okay that's a 15- oh, actually I have expertise with the ship."
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah yeah you're looking for ships. You can, you can."
Zac: So that becomes a 17.
"Brennan: There are other inbound Tigers, correct."
Emily: Behind or in front?
"Brennan: Not in front, behind."
: Okay.
": Yeah, so we'll shoot these dudes and keep going."
: Yeah so I'll go first.
"Emily: Crit, baby!"
Brennan: Oh my God.
"Emily: Yes, ooh okay. So I'm gonna throw a kinetic die on there too."
Ally: Nice.
Emily: Can I have my?
Murph: D4?
: D4.
"Murph: I think I give you one back, but I can give you another one if you need one."
Ally: What's the normal ship speed?
Siobhan: 300.
Emily: 16.
Brennan: Are you firing the one in the back or one of the ones in the front?
Emily: I'm gonna fire at one of the damaged ones.
"Brennan: One of the damaged ones in the, okay gotcha. Still up, but in tatters."
"Emily: Okay I'm gonna leave that for you then, and then I'm just gonna try"
to attack the one next to it.
Brennan: Copy that.
Emily: Does a 16 hit?
Brennan: 16 hits.
Emily: Okay do another kinetic die. 10 energy damage.
"Brennan: That one (laser and explosion noises) blasted out, one of the two in immediate pursuit skids into the canyon wall as you take out its right wing engine, skids across the wall, tumbling metal and fire. That is gonna be you, Barry."
"Murph: Everybody cool if I use a power die, do a Precision Shot?"
Lou: Go off king.
"Murph: Sweet, gonna shoot at this one directly behind us that Sid injured. Ooh, not great, 17."
Brennan: 17 hits.
"Lou: Sid, you didn't use a power die, right?"
"Emily: I didn't, yeah."
: Okay.
Emily: I was kind of feeling like maybe I should save it for some of the maneuvering outta here.
Lou: We've got plenty.
Emily: Oh we do.
Lou: We have plenty.
Emily: I'll use more in the future then.
Lou: We have an abundance of power dice.
: Daddy power dice.
"Lou: Daddy power dice will provide, it works out this because I'm also realizing I can reactor boost at the beginning of a turn before you guys go if need be."
Murph: 18 damage.
Brennan: That one also blasted outta the sky.
"Murph: Rad, bonus action explosive shot. Gonna shoot the slowed one."
"Brennan: Okay slowed one is way back so that's gonna be disadvantage, but you can still make the attack."
"Murph: Sweet, okay. So that was a bonus action, people cool with me, so I used a power die already."
Emily: I didn't use any.
Murph: To do explosive can I use three? Can I do another Precision Shot?
"Ally: You know what I am actually going to use Enhanced Scopes as my bonus action, and I can expend a power die to increase the range by 500 feet."
Murph: Rad.
Ally: And if it hits you then add the power die to your attack's damage.
Lou: Go off.
Brennan: Hell yes.
Murph: Alright this is no longer dis: you gave me advantage? What did you give me?
"Brennan: Oh, no Enhanced Scopes cancels the disadvantage."
: Yeah yeah.
"Murph: Got it okay. Oh boy not great oh, 18."
Brennan: 18 hits.
"Murph: Thank God I did Precision Shot. So then I've got Precision Shot a d6 from what Marge gave me and then two d4s. Sweet, 20 damage."
"Brennan: The gunner channel crackles electricity as the badly injured Tigers behind you are blasted and smeared along the canyon wall, the reactor thrumming with energy, the scopes enhanced from the operator station. You blast these Tigers outta the sky. We move to the next board, re-rolling initiative."
: Whoa.
: Whoa.
: All right.
"Zac: That was for you, Gunnie."
Ally: Like for our ship?
Brennan: Re-roll for your ship yeah. Skip.
: You're alive!
"Gunny: I'm alive, no I'm still here."
"Riva: What channel were you on, we're all on the gunner channel."
Gunny: Sorry I was on the Jib-Job channel.
"Sidney: Oh, how's Jib-Job doing?"
"Ally: So the Enhanced Scopes was a bonus action. So can in that last round as my action, I was actually gonna use direct so that whoever's gonna make that roll for our speed can have advantage."
"Brennan: Oh hell- That's right I forgot, yeah. The gunners take that."
Siobhan: Oh yeah I also-
"Brennan: Oh yeah we'll actually, yeah, we're gonna move to the next board. But as we're gonna, the next board, we'll go ahead so you're gonna take the direct action. You're gonna make the repairs to the ship's speed."
Lou: Yeah.
Brennan: Go for it. Give me a mechanics kit check.
Ally: With advantage.
Brennan: With advantage.
"Lou: First one's a dirty 20. Second one's not- less than that. We'll go with a dirty 20, does that do it?"
Brennan: A dirty 20 does repair the halved speed condition.
"Ally: Great yeah, it was like boost engines adds 50 to the speed, but if we just got it all back that's 150."
Siobhan: And since that's back I'll do boost engines and make it an even 350.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and give us the check."
Siobhan: That is a 12.
"Brennan: Hell yes, amazing. So you go from 150 to 350 as your ship’s speed. You hit the thing see where the damage is, get it repaired, engine kicks back up, boost the engines, boost the reactor flying forward through space."
Ally: Let's get nasty.
Emily: Can I open the moon roof in my gunning station? So I feel the-
"Brennan: The desert wind. Yeah beautiful, ponytail majestic whips forward, and then catches the real wind and."
Emily: I go like (screams)
Barry Syx: Sid! Get back in!
"Brennan: It's that kind of wind where you're like, can’t… breathe… Incredible."
"Zac: I didn't roll initiative yet, should I do that?"
"Brennan: Go ahead and roll initiative if you have operative stuff you can add to your initiative, feel free to do that as well, I'm not sure if you do."
"Zac: Well, I can do that thing where I can move my speed."
"Brennan: But that's probably, that's not a deployment thing. Yeah."
Zac: Yeah.
That's a two.
: Okay.
Zac: That sucks.
Ally: Do we have anything to reroll that?
"Emily: Oh we really need some shields, I forgot."
"Brennan: Oh, but let me actually, you do regenerate six points to your shields at the beginning of that turn, and also you got that you got a power die back at the beginning of that turn as well."
Zac: We gotta get our ship's dex up.
Emily: We really do.
: I know.
"Siobhan: How do we take, how do we get our ships to take a feat?"
Zac: Maybe we don't do a casino next time.
"Gunny: Okay, this is just a bad time to complain about the casino."
"Brennan: You are approaching the finishing line of the final race of Skiff Fest you'll see, in a canyon below you, all these skiffs racing the canyon, the viewing deck here, and a squadron of six Tigers falls in after you, you roll initiative, you can use evasive maneuvers. So you're gonna roll a d6 multiplied by 50, you can move that before initiative and as you know, you rolled pretty low on initiative."
"Zac: Three, 150 feet."
"Brennan: Okay and I would say measure from the ground right, but yeah, you can move 150 feet."
: Just a nice little kiss.
"Zac: Yeah. I mean like trying to get to this corner, like as close as we can to the right side, like sort of at, just forward to the right a little bit."
"Brennan: Cool, so you see, yeah these Tigers coming in behind you, you whip that ship over to the corner, hugging the wall as hard as you can."
Zac: Just trying to cut the angle off of some of those guys.
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely, you have partial cover from half of the Tigers."
Zac: Okay and it's their turn?
"Brennan: It is, they use their movement to close in here, and they are going to start making attacks."
"Zac: So with Colonian Turn, when you are the target of an attack roll, you can expend a power die and attempt to maneuver outta the line of fire, roll the die take the results and multiply by 50, so I wanna like bank along and like continue this curve."
"Brennan: Holy shit, okay, go ahead roll a power die, roll a d6."
Lou: It's our last one.
Zac: Six.
Brennan: Holy shit. 300 feet in any direction.
"Ally: Get us full cover, baby."
Emily: We are gonna get full cover.
Brennan: We're gonna move the Wurst 300 feet down the crack.
Zac: Had to use it right?
Emily: I thought that was great.
"Lou: That's awesome. Perfect, a perfect usage."
"Zac: Daddy power die, is that okay?"
Lou: Of course Daddy power die could make more die later.
"Brennan: Holy shit. So as they start unload, you guys see the captain hit this thing, you can literally feel in the console of the pilot's chair, a little creak of the metal as you physically pull the controls. You guys hear like cactus and lichen and rocks coming off the canyon wall scraping against the hull."
Emily: I think that the gunning pod is just like going against the wall just shattering.
"Brennan: Yeah, I dunno if you know who's right and who's left here, do you?"
Emily: I think I'm right.
"Brennan: You're right, yeah Sid you're like, hairs moving in your face and you literally see a bunch of little big horn tortoises jump off the canyon wall into the ship."
Emily: I grab one.
"Brennan: Grab one, cool. Scraping the rock. With that six, literally a five would've exposed the tail of the ship, you have total cover to the Brigade Tigers. However, so they use their movement they no longer have line of sight to you. So those six Tigers are going to take 400 feet of movement using their actions to dash 'cause they beat you in the initiative order. So we're gonna move this group, this squadron of Tigers, they're gonna try to hug that corner as well to give themselves as much firing angle as possible as you attempt to now make this left hand turn off the canyon wall. So yeah, that's as far as the Tigers make it. So depending on what happens movement wise on your turn, they're gonna have some kind of line of fire to you as they come rocketing in. Squadron moves, that is your turn."
"Ally: Okay, what do we need?"
"Brennan: All right, gunner channel, what's up."
Ally: Boost engines or do you want to direct?
Murph: Do you want us to shoot first?
"Siobhan: Wait, I have a question."
Brennan: Yeah?
"Siobhan: These guys are Amercadians, the people in New Texas fucking hate Amercadians, right?"
Brennan: They have a bizarre love hate relationship with Amercadia.
Siobhan: Would it be possible for me to open our comms channels and there's all these fucking skiffs around.
Brennan: Yes.
Siobhan: And do a persuasion check to be like.
Ally: Jump to your death onto these.
"Brennan: Right, the fucking government's coming. The government! You hate the government! The government's trying to take your jobs."
"Brennan: I'm gonna say you have improved space casting, go ahead and give me a persuasion check. We'll call it a flat persuasion check."
"Siobhan: Great, with my persuasion or the ship's persuasion?"
"Brennan: We, I will say you open comms channel, it's your persuasion."
"Siobhan: Great. Oh, that's a 25."
Murph: How many libertarian skiffers do we-
"Brennan: Riva, you open the comms channel and say, “The government's here to take your jobs,” and you hear-"
Emily: To take your jobs?
"Brennan: You start getting hail signals from channels all over the outskirts of Baustin, New Texas. You hear,"
"Copy that, that's 10-4. I've been waiting, I got a nuke in my backyard. Let's go!"
"Yeah, you hear a whole fleet of incoming responses of people."
"Ally: In a British accent, the government's here to take your jobs."
Zac: Your jobs as shiteater and skiff--
"Brennan: Unbelievable, the exact kind of gibberish that would appeal to somebody with that political outlook."
": Here we go, baby."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Murph: We're super low on power die, right?"
"Lou: Yeah we should expend one before our reactor boost, if someone has just--"
: Are we out?
"Emily: So I think, do we have line of sight on them right now?"
Brennan: The there is one in the lead that has partial cover from you guys.
Emily: Okay then why don't I expend that?
: Great.
Emily: So my first shot is going to be a dirty 20 to hit.
"Brennan: That bypasses the cover, you hit on a dirty 20."
"Emily: And I am going to expend a superiority die to give them, uh, disadvantage on their next attack roll. Right? Or do you want me to do the distracting shot? You like that distracting shot, right?"
"Murph: Yeah, I love that distracting shot."
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna do, I expend it to do distracting shot so that he'll have advantage on his next attack."
Brennan: Incredible.
"Emily: And I will also add another tech point. Hi, baby."
"Ally: Hey, baby."
"Emily: 12, 15 energy."
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: 15 energy chews through the shields, you are good to go."
"Emily: And then I can spend another tech point to bonus attack, but we have no-"
"Lou: Yeah, I need to reactor boost before we have more."
"Emily: Can, can I hold my second, my bonus action for after the reactor boost?"
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Emily: I will do that.
"Lou: Let's reactor boost. Oh, that's a four. So just a clean four and then we're, that's a 19 on the constitution save so a perfect reactor boost."
Murph: Perfect.
Brennan: How about it? We love it. Hitting the engines.
Murph: You have a second shot?
"Emily: Okay, and then I'll do my second one and I'm gonna make it a freaking precision, why not?"
"Brennan: Hell yeah, here we go."
"Emily: Okay, that is a 25 to hit."
Brennan: 25 hits.
Emily: Okay and I'll do another one of these. Oh my God!
Ally: Nice. 3 and 4.
"Emily: 10, 18, 1, 2, 3, and I'm doing this on a new one 'cause I'm leaving the damaged one for him."
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: So 12, 6, 18 becomes 21."
"Brennan: 21 damage chews through the shields, chews through the shields."
"Murph: Can, we can see two of them."
Brennan: If Zac is gonna move on this turn.
: He's gonna open you guys.
"Emily: Can we just save that for when we had, 'cause I just rolled max"
"on all my damage dice, and-"
: Yes.
Emily: I can't loose that.
Murph: Can you start? You can start your movement.
Brennan: And how much damage did you do on that second attack?
"Emily: On the second attack I did 12 plus six, 21."
"Brennan: You did 20, Jesus, okay, cool."
"Zac: Well here's the thing, I was gonna try to move to a point where none of them have cover I mean, where we have complete cover."
"Brennan: So I guess, but you have full, you can move allowing them to fire and then complete your movement."
"Zac: I mean, if we could boost engines, maybe we could get around this corner."
"Ally: Yes, boosted."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: 17 on the die.
Brennan: So your speed is 350 right now.
"Zac: With fly, which gives us with the speed of 300, your: you move up to so we have 350 right now."
"Brennan: And you have a bonus action, right?"
"Zac: Yeah so that's 700, 1050 feet."
"Brennan: Well, you can move 1050 feet forward."
Zac: So that would get us like here?
"Brennan: You'd be like, yeah, you'd be fully like around the corner under the overhang, yeah."
"Zac: Yeah, why not? I guess let's just do that. Brennan: Cool, so you like dip the banking shot, get the cover from the wall and peel out, doing a triple move down the canyon."
Murph: Can I shoot basically as soon as we start moving and I can see dudes?
Brennan: Absolutely.
Murph: Sweet.
: Okay.
"Emily: And so I basically, I hit two different ones."
": Yes, you got it."
"Murph: Okay. So now I'm gonna roll with advantage because Sid gave me advantage, we've used one power die?"
Lou: You used another one?
"Emily: I did use one, yes."
"Lou: So yeah, we have three."
"Murph: So I'm not gonna use one yet, I don't think, or should I?"
Zac: Try to save me one if you can.
"Murph: Okay great, so I will start with just the advantage shot. Sweet, 22 to hit."
Brennan: 22 Hits.
"Murph: Okay, this is to whatever one is the most damaged."
Emily: Maybe go for the one that I did 21 damage too.
"Murph: Yeah okay, pretty good 5, 8, 10 damage."
"Brennan: Okay, not down."
Murph: In that case-
"Emily: Spend the superiority die to try and get him down, right?"
Murph: Yeah I'll do the Precision Shot then if that's cool with everyone?
Lou: Do the damn thing.
Murph: It's an extra two damage.
Brennan: Not gonna do it.
Murph: God.
"Brennan: That one's looking very bad in tatters. We had an action here, we used, we boosted the engines. We've done triple move. Wanna do an AstroNav?"
"Lou: Yeah. Oh, a cool 16."
Brennan: Two completed equations.
: Whoa.
: We're up to four?
: We're up to four.
Murph: Did we roll that turn to get our shields back?
Lou: I can do that is it just the d8 plus nothing?
"Brennan: Oh, shield yes, roll d8 plus nothing."
Lou: Two.
Brennan: Two shield points back. All right we're going to move that Tiger squadron 400 feet trying to get as much sight on the Wurst as they can get.
: I think none of them are down.
"Emily: None of them are down unfortunately he has a thing that lets him, if he gets someone to zero, then he can take a bonus action to shoot, so I was trying to set that up."
"Brennan: That's going to be, as they're rushing through the canyon, after you, you might be long range for them."
"Emily: We are. Yeah, we are."
": Nice, yeah."
Brennan: That's gonna be disadvantage.
Zac: I'm gonna use the Colonian Turn to try to get out of sight from some of them. I dunno.
: That is right!
"Brennan: Hell yes, blow the power die. Go ahead and roll that d6. Let's hope you roll high."
Zac: Four.
Brennan: Okay we're gonna move 200 feet forward.
Zac: I'm gonna try to bank to the left I think.
Emily: Yeah.
Ally: That's unbelievable.
Emily: What a slippery little fricking wiener.
"Brennan: I cannot believe this is some the, the, the, this, I gotta again, shout out this system it's so fun. It's so fun, I can't believe how many things there are. Holy shit, did you just fucking do that? You were about to get fired on even with disadvantage by everybody and you pull another Colonian Turn and skid past, pulling 400 feet forward, total cover."
Skip: Get nasty.
"Ally: Wow, Skip, you're a real nasty gal."
Emily: Nasty doozy.
Brennan: Total cover.
Skip: Get nasty.
Brennan: As you pull around that corner that squadron there coming out of stealth mode around the corner-
Zac: Shit.
"Brennan: -two Tigers coming from the opposite direction bear down on you, open fire on you, and immediately have their comms jammed by all of the CB radio."
Siobhan dabs.
"Brennan: So you're gonna roll me two dexterity saves for the ship, but you're gonna you each one with advantage."
Zac: First set.
Siobhan: Can I just say Brennan? These Tigers are really cute. You zoom in on these Tigers really cute. Not scary at all.
"Brennan: Not scary at all. Shout out to the original design for these Michael Kaluta, the artist for Starstruck, these are fully pulled from the world of Starstruck themselves."
Zac: 19 on the die becomes 18.
"Brennan: Okay, you make the first save."
: Nice.
"Zac: Second save. Four, with advantage."
Brennan: With advantage that's a four?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: That is five points of damage, speed halved once again. Speed halved once again. So two of these Tigers in the back squadron are going to stay put where they are right now, and another four are going to surge forwards. Basically every time one has been close enough to fire on you, you've used that turn to deprive them of a shot, but those two had to take actions to take those shots that they then missed and had total cover on. Your speed has been halved but it's gonna come back to your turn you got two Tigers you're looking at right here. You regain five shield points."
Emily: Okay.
Murph: Do we want to do a check to get the speed back instead of worrying about shooting everything?
"Emily: Let's try to get the, yeah."
Siobhan: I'll direct you on that.
Lou: Am I the only person who can do that?
"Brennan: Who can do the do the, no it's a patch check, so anyone can do a patch check."
"Emily: What about, what about me? Can I from the gunning station try to do so something to help the speed?"
Brennan: Yes anyone on the ship can make a patch check to try to-
Emily: What is it?
Brennan: It's a DC 20 mechanics kit check.
Lou: Okay.
Emily: Okay I would need to crit.
"Murph: Yeah, I think we could just go easy on power dice this time."
Lou: We've got two.
Ally: And you have advantage.
Siobhan: And you have advantage from me and actually-
"Lou: Done and done or is that, wait?"
"Siobhan: So when I direct somebody, I basically get a portent roll."
Lou: Okay.
Siobhan: So I rolled a 16.
"Lou: Oh, fantastic. We're good."
Siobhan: So I can give that to you.
Lou: Yeah that's 24.
"Brennan: Amazing, 24. You undo the halved condition. Do you wanna throw another AstroNav check on there?"
Lou: A 17.
Brennan: Another two. You're up to six.
Siobhan: Six outta 10 ain't bad.
"Brennan: Six outta 10 ain't bad. We've taken the direct action here, we have this anything else?"
Ally: Can anyone try to do one of those-
Lou: AstroNavs.
Ally: AstroNavs?
"Lou: Well, I do it by myself by hand."
"Brennan: Someone can jump on the computer, you're only rolling plus one, but you can absolutely jump on the NavCom and try to make that happen."
"Ally: I'm sure I can figure this out. God, fuck, god damn it oh, that's afive."
"Gunny: It's the computer, the computer is trash."
Murph: I'm learning.
"Sidney: Don't let SQ hear you say that, they are very sensitive."
Ally: Can I look around and see if anyone saw that?
Brennan: [laughs] You don't think anyone saw that.
[Emily laughs]
"Ally: Thank God, okay, moving on."
"Zac: Is anyone, so like if anyone can boost engines...?"
Murph: I can boost speed.
Zac: I think that'd be great 'cause maybe we can bank around this corner.
Murph: Is that cool? I feel like-
"Emily: Yeah, I feel like we can't do anything to stop these folks."
"Zac: There's just so many of them, yeah."
"Murph: I'm gonna boost, I'm gonna boost engines."
"Brennan: Cool, go for it."
"Murph: Do I get advantage on strength checks when I'm raging, or just-?"
Brennan: Not for the ship.
"Murph: Got it. Oh no, I didn't do it."
"Brennan: Okay ship's end, and ship speed stays at 300."
"Ally: Wait we still have, you could boost, right?"
"Brennan: No, only one action per turn, so the action fails."
Zac: We attempted it.
"Ally: I gotcha, I gotcha."
"Emily: I could try to boost something what should I boost, speed?"
Murph: Shields?
Emily: Boost engines or shields.
: Shield's 'cause-
"Murph: Engines we already tried, I failed."
"Emily: Oh, I see if that's what do you guys think I should regenerate the shields?"
: Yes.
: That would be good.
Emily: Okay well I failed because it was impossible to succeed.
Lou: You didn't get a 33.
"Brennan: What's the roll? Yeah, roll two d8."
Emily: 4.
"Brennan: 4 okay. You get, you get four shield points back and Skip what's the play?"
"Zac: Slippery pilot, bonus action dash."
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Full fly movement to, I don't know if you can see it on the board, but like right next to this cactus in this like last little section of that."
"Brennan: Hell yes, I see it. You get to the very edge of the board as you do all of the back squadron of Tigers are going to take 800 feet of movement down the board with this Slippery Pilot blasting the engines here, there's just no way for them to catch, you going three times 300 is a hundred faster than them going twice at four and these two Tigers posted up are going to take their attacks on you again, they're gonna be able to come back and take 400 feet of movement to catch you here."
: Gotcha.
"Emily: Just FYI we have all, we have two power die, we didn't use any."
"Zac: Gotcha. Can I, can I try to Colonian Turn? I from here, I don't know what's in front of us. I don't even know if there's-"
"Brennan: Gotcha, well, you might be able to clear the map, but go ahead and give me a roll."
l: Big 6.
Zac: 6.
[cast cheers]
Zac: Big Barry Syx.
Ally: Big Barry Syx!
"Brennan: Incredible. They are going to take shots on you once again, their systems are jammed from all the CB radio interaction coming in, give me another two saving throws with advantage both times."
Emily: Do we have any power die to add to this?
"Lou: Yeah, we have, we got one more."
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: First one… 13.
"Brennan: Okay, 13, rolling with advantage : you got it."
Zac: Second one… 8.
"Siobhan: Can I, can I give an old Watch Out on the 13?"
: Yeah.
Brennan: And also you're not certain that the DC here is necessarily that high.
Siobhan: Oh then I'll do a Watch Out on the old eight.
: Eight.
Siobhan: Why not?
": And we have a power die too, can we also power die the eight?"
: That is.
": Power die the 8, yeah yeah."
: Three.
"Brennan: Does that give you? That gives you an 11? Watch out. You raced out the canyon, they miss both times, not halving your movement you clear the map, race down the canyon. Give me another AstroNav check if you'd be so kind, you can roll this with advantage."
"Lou: Oh and I'll add a six to that, that's gonna be a-"
"Murph: Ball's rolling up, up."
"Lou: Ball's rolling up, that's gonna be a 28."
"Brennan: 26 through 29, your calculations are masterful resulting in four completed equations, faster than light, the Wurst races past hyon beams going for your engines, Skip pulls ahead. These Tigers can't get the shot off as all of their signals are jammed by all the people living in various bunkers and tin shacks hit their hit their comms channels from every direction, you lift up and as the orbital laser powers up, racing through the sky there is no ship to hit.

[adventurous music]
"Brennan: Hello, one and all! Welcome back to another thrilling episode of “Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey.” I'm your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan, with me as always are our intrepid heroes, say hi, intrepid heroes!"
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Last we left off, our intre— Last we left off, our intrepid heroes were on the world of Hon Ober in the capital city of Hon Grii, at Uncle B.O.B's Fantanimalland searching for ancient Terran artifacts as well as the mysteries of the day of the slaughter of the Barry Battalion. To try and sum up what's happened this season so far truly is hard to do. Suffice it—"
Lou: Can we have our first recap episode in Dimension 20?
Emily: I’m feeling really giddy. I don't think I could do a recap.
"Ally: Do the recap, do the recap!"
Brennan: Do the full recap. Okay. Pretty much what's going on is this. Okay…
[Emily laughing and crying a little bit]
Siobhan: Where has this come from? You were completely fine until the camera started.
"Emily: I felt— Because everyone was doing this and it started to make me feel really giddy, but if I think about certain things I'm gonna cry."
"Ally: Wait, what?"
"Lou: What, like “we've been having so much fun”? Like “last day at camp”?"
Emily: We've just had a lot of funny moments!
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: A lot of funny moments. So, like, to try to get our head around where we're at and what's going on in AnarchEra 220 here in the galaxy… [laughing]"
Ally: We're all COVID-hugging you.
"Lou: Don't cry, 'cause if you cry, I'll cry, and…"
"Ally: Okay, actually though, 'cause if you… Do you know that if you cry?"
"Lou: I know, and that's why I'm like, “Emily, keep it together.”"
Ally: I'm kind of being serious.
"Brennan: This is the energy, both here at the table, in the dome—"
Ally: We all do an actor-off where we're like…
"Siobhan: I'm not gonna cry, I'm not crying this season. No tears from Siobhan this season."
Ally: Oh. Don't spit in the face of God.
Siobhan: I'm not fucking crying!
"Brennan: So, okay. We start with a ship called the Red Hot… [laughing]"
Lou: We gonna do this? We gonna do this?
Ally: Are we gonna do this?
"Lou: Be real, we doing this?"
"Brennan: No, okay. We— I don't know— I actually don't know what's happening. If you're at home and you're seeing this, send help. But…"
[cast laughing]
"Emily: I just was feeling giddy, and then when he said we're gonna do a recap, I started to think of funny moments, and I can't control it."
"Ally: But they made you cry, they were so funny? Or like, 'cause it's about to be over?"
"Emily: No, because I was starting to try to hold in a laugh, and when I try to hold in a laugh, it comes out as tears."
Ally: Oh my god.
"Brennan: For sure, for sure. For sure. That makes sense. So again, loosely, if I try to zoom out and talk about what's happened in this season so far."
"Zac: Yeah, where are we, in space?"
Brennan: We're sort of in space.
Lou: Great.
"Brennan: Big, big, big points here. 'Cause you gotta go back and watch the season to sort of see what's going on. Big points here are Norman “Skip” Takamori gets brain-slugged at around the time that Margaret Encino, an executive of United Free Trade Planets, goes through a quarter-life crisis—"
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: —because her friend gets promoted to Crown and Scepter Limited, and chooses to deeply invest in a sort of junker space freighter proldier vessel with a much, if I can say, mistreated crew of Barry Syx, the now brotherless clone trooper; Sundry Sidney, first and last of her line and rogue android; Riva, the Aguatunisian psychic on gallivant; and Gunthrie “Gunnie” Miggles- Rashbax, cyborg mechanic of about 750,000 credits in debt to the Acme-Ashmun Corporation, and soon by extension the Repo Reapers. Things turn around for the newly renamed The Wurst as the ball starts rolling uphill with a couple of big Smash n' Grab jobs and a reorganizing of the business strategy by Margaret Encino and a brand new management style from now who we are calling Skip, the newly cerebro-slugged—"
Zac: Right on.
Brennan: —pilot of The Wurst.
Lou: Right on.
"Brennan: The successful sabotage of the Carbine Kennel Club Dog Show aboard Rec 97, the overthrow of the corrupt Sheriff Warner Codge in the city of Baustin, New Texas, and behind all of that, bringing on board some new crew members, not only Raymond Zam and his Jib-Jobbers, who have been since the beginning, but Aurora Nebbins, the Royal Blue Mastiff, the Princeps Zortch of Rubian Five, and their new chef."
Emily: The Princhepf.
"Brennan: The Prince-chef, the princhepfs…"
[cast all trying to combine ‘Princeps’ and ‘chef’ in various ways]
Ally: Oh my god.
"Brennan: And the Princeps bringing along a holofract of a planetary supercomputer known as Gnosis. Origins of Gnosis originating in a Terran artifact on Griivarr worlds that you have recently copied onto Margaret's data pad, here at Uncle B.O.B's Fantanimalland. So much lore, a lot going on, various factions across the galaxy are in pursuit of you. Warfare Whitneys trying to scrub some bad PR in the form of Sundry Sidney, United Free Trade Planets, who has frozen the account and terminated Margaret Encino, the Amercadian Space Brigade and the Admiral Gust Weatherall seeking to go after Skip for the murder of 12 sisters of the Cosmic Veil."
Zac: [air quotes] “Murder”.
Siobhan: Fuck that guy.
"Brennan: The Repo Reapers coming to repossess Gunnie's parts, the Lone Star Directorate on the planet of New Texas, oh, and of course, your old nemesis, that mean old lady out there amongst the stars, Jan De La Vega of the Lady Pike."
Siobhan: She's our best friend.
Emily: She's gonna be on our side.
Ally: She's so close.
Emily: She's so close.
"Ally: She's so butch. She doesn't know that about me, but so am I."
[cast laughing]
Lou: She may not know this yet. But she'll learn.
"Brennan: We found Dr. Edwina Castor, who had a life that you all decided was sad, but that she thinks rules."
"Ally: Oh my god, I forgot about that."
"Brennan: Doing home shopping, getting drunk as a skunk on mojitos and white Russians."
Siobhan: So much lime and milk.
"Brennan: So much lime, so much milk, so much mint. Who told you that you didn't originate as a patent, you originated as a trademark, by the marketing associate Auma Liu. And by the way, Auma is A-U-M-A, Auma."
Ally: Oh.
"Emily: A-U-M-A, oh, so it's not Alma like Spanish for soul. A-U-M-A."
Brennan: Who— You realize that the trademark originated with Auma and that Auma was maybe the one that released you back at that boardroom.
Emily: And Auma… Margaret knows.
"Brennan: And you know Auma, back from the, yeah, from the leadership summit."
Ally: That's why I'm the cool aunt.
"Brennan: Exactly. Additionally, you discovered the craniobolt buried, Riva and… Craniobolt, that…"
Siobhan: Some metallic thing.
"Brennan: Some metallic thing that Riva and Skip, working inside the brain, discovered there. And there's also some outstanding business to take care of, this fabled email to Jan De La Vega we've been hearing about, not only that, but also you have meetings on the book with both a sponsorship email for Acme- Ashmun, and…"
"Emily: Do I need to have been saying that, like, Handy Annie, equipped with the holorecorder that I paid for, has been capturing footage?"
Brennan: Yes.
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: Established canon.
"Emily: Okay, cool."
Brennan: We will assume that's always happening in the background.
Emily: Great.
Brennan: But you have important points of contact with Acme-Ashmun for that sponsorship that you're gonna approach them about as well as your potential union enrollment—
Ally: With Ife.
"Brennan: Yeah, with Ife and U4F. However, where we left off to the moment was in Uncle B.O.B's Fantanimalland with Barry and Margaret in between the restrooms, the invertebrate house, and the discipline hub, with Riva swimming in a giant fountain, Gunnie going to get snacks, and Sid and Skip investigating the elevator shaft. And last we left off, Skip felt a blaster pistol in his back, and was addressed once again as Prince Valdrinor. We return to this moment, Zac, Skip feels the gun on his back, and you feel the bristling mustache."
Zac: I feel the bristling mustache?
"Brennan: You feel the mustache, he's, like, whispering in your ear, so the mustache is, like, right up here, going…"
"Drablian: Your majesty. It seems we meet again. This time I think you shall find me much more formidable than when I was in the body of Melon, the pug."
Zac: In the human voice of Norman.
Skip: What do you want?
"Drablian: You can only avoid your destiny for so long, I am afraid. The great emhatchening must commence. Your father is very worried, your majesty. He wonders with great force where you are."
Skip: Don't do this.
"Drablian: What do you mean, don't do this?"
Skip: Just give me more time.
"Drablian: More time? We are running out of time. Soon the great egg will be finished, and the great emhatchening will commence. For a thousand years have the cerebro-slugs and the house of Frangus bent all of our vast resources. The Mentophagian Dynasty's very future depends on—"
"Brennan: He's screaming loud in your ear, in the middle. It's like, balloons, people getting cotton candy, people walking around."
Skip: Please. I was frozen for a very long time. I didn't get to experience anything.
"Drablian: Experience? There is no need to experience, your majesty. We know what our destiny is. You must join your father. We cannot create the genetic sequence without you. Our species depends on it."
Skip: There's no way to do it without me?
"Drablian: Your line, your glorious line."
[Emily laughing]
"Drablian: Your beautiful genes, sire."
"Ally: You can feel his mustache, but what else do you feel?"
[Emily laughing]
Siobhan: He's standing really close behind you.
Lou: This is getting so sexual.
"Zac: Okay, okay."
"Drablian: The great egg is being prepared. We will join gloriously. We will begin a pupation, and then all of our bodies will commingle in a great orgasmic soup! Without your genes, the soup cannot be made!"
"Zac: I think Skip is trying to think of any way out of this at this moment. He says,"
Skip: Please. I… I have a son.
Lou and Siobhan stifle laughter.
Brennan: Give me Deception.
Skip: I have a son. My sweet boy is out there alone.
Brennan: Give me a Deception—
"Skip: Getting a snack, and if I go before he comes back, he will be scared and alone."
Lou: It's me.
Zac: Cocked.
Emily: Is it Deception if it's true?
Zac: Is it true to Skip?
Emily: To Skip.
Brennan: Then it's Persuasion or Deception.
Lou: That I'm his son?
Zac: Either is negative one.
Ally: No!
[Emily groaning]
Zac: Four.
Skip: My sweet boy is all alone—
Brennan: He shoots you right in the ass.
Skip: My ass!
Brennan: He's gonna make an attack roll. That is going to hit. He deals five points of damage to you.
Zac: Okay.
Zac: That's all right.
"Brennan: You see he says,"
"Drablian: Now that, sire, is just a love tap."
Skip: Can we talk face to face?
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: We are now going to, I'm gonna ask everyone here. We're not gonna enter combat, but I am gonna ask us to roll initiative."
Emily: Okay.
Lou: Okay.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Emily: Ooh, baby. 21."
Murph: 18.
Ally: 17.
Zac: 10.
Siobhan: Six.
Lou: 15!
Brennan: We're gonna start with 21.
Emily: That's me!
"Brennan: That's you. Sid, you're around the elevator shaft."
"Emily: Yeah, so you said I'm not seeing any of this."
Brennan: Give me a Perception check and also a Investigation check.
Emily: Perception is 22.
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: Here we go.
Emily: And Investigation is 14.
"Brennan: You can sense a draft coming from down below, but you notice in the open elevator that there are no buttons for going down to lower floors. So it feels like there's a big opening that there are lower places in the elevator shaft here, even though the elevator's not capable of going to them."
"Emily: Okay. Can I… I guess, like, I was coming to inspect it with Skip. I presumably don't know anything that's going on."
"Brennan: You hear loud shouting around. So that— On that 22 Perception, you hear someone being like, “House of Frangus”, and you know."
"Emily: Okay, then I think I will go over—"
Zac: Shot in my butt.
"Emily: Oh yeah, and there's, okay, so can I look over and be like,"
"Sidney: Skip, what's going on?"
"Brennan: You see his chin on, like, the nape of Skip's neck and his mustache up in his ear, turns to you, fully pressed up against Skip, and goes,"
"Drablian: Oh, nothing. Simply a conversation about this unknown guest littering in—"
"Emily: Cool, I shoot him."
[cast laughing]
Zac: Can I do something real fast?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
Zac: Initiative with bad feeling I can move before? Would you say I would be able to.
Brennan: Yes. Does it count as a disengage?
"Zac: It doesn't, but can I use my reaction disengage when I do it? Or if that's before, maybe I can't."
"Brennan: I think you can use your reaction disengage, yeah, absolutely."
"Zac: I wanna do that just to fly straight up to get out of, like, to give her a clear shot."
"Brennan: Okay, incredible. So you just go straight up."
Emily: And then I'm going to Weapon Expert attack with advantage. That's 20.
Ally: Crit!
"Emily: Crit, baby!"
"Siobhan: Oh, yes."
Emily: Okay.
Ally: Wait.
"Emily: And if I crit and I use a kinetic die on it, do I double my kinetic die?"
"Brennan: You do double your kinetic die, that's correct."
"Emily: Yes, baby!"
"Ally: Do brain slugs fly out of people's bodies into other bodies, or do they have to land?"
Siobhan: I guess we'll find out.
"Ally: Yeah, right."
"Emily: Okay, so 25, 29 damage on my first attack. And then I'm gonna fucking attack again 'cause I have two attacks now."
Brennan: Go for it.
Siobhan: Wow.
Ally: Here we go.
"Siobhan: Here we go, world."
"Emily: Okay, does a 13 hit?"
Brennan: 13 does not hit.
Emily: Okay. And then I'm also going to activate my rocket boots with my bonus action.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: And I'm, you know what, Skip is out of the way, I will, as a reaction, throw a grenade at him."
Brennan: Absolutely.
"Emily: I'm just gonna do one of my plasma grenades. So Strength, sorry. So he's gonna do a Dex save. Explosives thing."
Brennan: He does make the save.
"Emily: Okay, well he still takes half damage, and I'll take that half damage. Oh, nine and an eight, 17. So half of that."
"Brennan: Eight damage, cool. So as this guy keeps being like,"
"Drablian: Sire, you— Whoop?"
"Brennan: Turns around and… [gunshots banging] You don't know if the guy's dead, 'cause there's just a crater. There's just a crater. You're, like, hovering up on, you're both, like, rocket boots and jet pack up in the air."
"Emily: I think I also say,"
"Sidney: I think there's more down underneath this elevator, and so we can, like, fly under there, but we just can't get there with the elevator."
Skip: Okay.
"Zac: I'm gonna look around just to see if, like…"
Skip: I feel like I have to kill this man.
"Sidney: Yeah, no, we actually gotta kill him. I just wanted you to know."
Skip: Good to know.
Sidney: Yeah.
Skip: Have you seen my son?
"Emily: From this angle, can I see where Gunnie is? From this hovering—"
"Brennan: No, he's, like, off at the snacks section."
Sidney: We lost him! I'm worried about your son too.
"Brennan: Cool. Do you go over the elevator? Do you wanna try to do, like, bypass it in some way? Or like, how do you want to interact with it?"
"Emily: Oh, I think I'm just letting him know, but I think I'm gonna stay here, because I'm worried about, I don't want him to get fucked up or anything like that."
Zac: If it feels like we need to go down that—
"Emily: Okay, then I guess I'll use my… I guess my hope was to use my rocket boots to kind of, like, float down."
"Brennan: Oh, cool. So do you wanna, like, send the elevator—"
"Emily: Up to a higher thing. Like, press it to go up."
Brennan: One of you give me a security kit check to see if you can open the elevator doors while the elevator's not there.
Zac: I have a security kit.
"Emily: That means that you're proficient, I think."
Zac: So just add my proficiency to—
Brennan: It's just Intelligence plus proficiency.
Emily: Yeah.
"Zac: Oh, I add a…"
Emily: Fuck yeah.
Zac: I add seven to this.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Nice.
Emily: Great.
"Zac: 17 on the die, so 24."
"Brennan: Easy. You send the elevator up, you take out your security kit, put a little telescoping rod that you slide in between the sort of closing elevator doors, slides open, the rod pushes the thing open. Both of you have a jet pack and rocket boots and see a long chasm going down."
"Emily: Okay. Then, yeah."
Zac: Should we tell?
"Emily: I think we should, yeah, we should definitely just shout to everyone."
"Siobhan: Oh, we have comms."
"Emily: Oh yeah, in the comms, on the gunner channel."
"Brennan: Gunnie, you don't have comms, right? You gave yours to Zortch."
Sidney: We're heading down the elevator shaft. There's some sort of mysterious thing here. I'm assuming everyone is receiving this and I can't wait to rendezvous with all of you.
Brennan: Cool.
Skip: Down the tube.
"Brennan: I'm gonna roll a Luck check real quick. You want higher numbers. That's a four. Okay, great. Now, so you guys go down. Murph and Ally. Barry, you are standing in between these buildings looking around, and your eyes drift over to the invertebrate house."
"Murph: Can we poke our heads in there for a quick sec? And do we know, when the worms jump into you, is it eye or mouth?"
Brennan: With the Skip it was nose.
"Barry Syx: Oh my god. Is there any, do you wanna, we should cover up."
Margaret: Yeah.
"Murph: We should mask up. Yeah, I'm just gonna, I—"
Ally: We pull out KN95 masks.
"Murph: I assume we have some kind of, like, space thing. Right?"
"Brennan: Yeah. A little, like, pressure suit."
"Murph: Kinda just wanna put a little something on, sunglasses, gives her sunglasses."
"Ally: I'm wearing the biggest sunglasses. I'm like,"
Margaret: I feel fucking cool.
[cast laughing]
Emily: You're dressed like a wife.
[Siobhan laughing]
"Ally: I have long, long braids."
"Lou: Yeah, and Skip's wearing, like, khakis and stuff."
"Ally: I look like Kristen Applebees, like, at a rave."
Zac: Tucked-in polo shirt and khaki pants on.
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: Truly, truly perfect."
"Murph: All right, we gotta go, we gotta get Gunnie and we gotta get to where these guys are."
"Ally: Yeah, so we heard that, right?"
"Murph: But real quick, I wanna poke my head in there and see if there are, like, gathering psychic slugs in there."
"Ally: Yeah, can I look around also?"
"Brennan: Yeah, both of you guys give me Investigation checks as, you're both entering the invertebrate house, right?"
Murph: Yeah. I guess I'll give Marge the help action.
"Ally: Cool, thank you."
Murph: I don't have—
"Ally: Yeah, I have a plus 11 to Investigation."
Murph: That'll be a lot better than whatever I do.
Ally: Woo! That will be a 29.
"Brennan: Easy. You scoot up to the invertebrate house. Lots of weird, you know, mollusks and other, basically anything without a spine you can find in here. There's a giant tank, and you see a bunch of little kids and families running up, huge tank that says Cerebro-Slugs. And you see there are about, like, 30-odd, they have, like, a terrarium, there's a weird purple branch and a little plaque with information about cerebro-slugs, and you see these little [slurping] lime green cerebro-slugs, and you see there's a tour guide, like,"
"Tour Guide: Now these invertebrates, of course, are an extremely invasive species and can be found…"
"Brennan: And you see that one of the kids, like, goes up and puts their face up against the glass, and as they do, like, 12 of the slugs [slurping] leap to the glass and [slurping], like, suck on the outside of the glass, and the kid's like,"
Kid: Ha ha ha! Aminals.
Barry Syx: Everyone enjoy them at a distance.
Tour Guide: I'm sorry.
"Brennan: You see the tour guide says,"
"Tour Guide: I'm so sorry, sir. The exhibit is perfectly safe. The cerebro- slugs don't pose a threat."
"Barry Syx: Actually, they're not."
Margaret: Yeah.
Murph: I think I grab him.
Margaret: He's right.
Murph: I wanna look deeply in his eyes and see if there's a worm in there.
"Ally: Can I shine, like, a light from my palm device?"
Barry Syx: Let me see your eyes.
"Emily: It is weird, there's been explosions outside and the tour guide is still doing the tour."
Ally: Yes.
Brennan: Give me an Insight check.
Ally: I'll give you the help action.
"Brennan: Yeah, do it with advantage."
Murph: Please.
Emily: I think you should crit.
[Siobhan laughs]
Emily: I think you should crit.
Lou: I think you should crit.
Emily: Oh.
"Lou: Murph, did you actually choose not to crit?"
"Siobhan: Wow, Murph. Your wife told you that she thought you should crit."
Emily: Was I too naggy about it? That I wanted you to crit?
"Barry Syx: Margaret, can you look at this dude's eyes?"
"Brennan: Yeah, on a nine, you can't be sure. He goes,"
"Tour Guide: Sir, please, let go of me. I understand. I understand you're upset."
Brennan: You step away.
Lou: Let go of me.
Ally: Do we know…
"Murph: I would assume, so I as myself know that this is probably what happened to Barry Nyne, and I would assume Barry knows this at this point, sees the invertebrate things."
"Brennan: Cerebro-slugs in here next to the bathroom where Barry Nyne went, yeah, for sure."
"Emily: Yeah, cause you had that crit, and you had that memory."
Murph: I'm gonna convey that to you guys too.
"Barry Syx: By the way, if you guys see Barry Nyne, I think he was cerebro- slugged."
Margaret: Whoa.
Skip: Cerebro what?
"Ally: Can I look and see if there is a hole between, like, the tank and, like, the bathroom on the other side of the wall, or if that was just, like, a fluke?"
"Brennan: As you start looking for that, go ahead and give… You hear a little [beeps] on your transponder."
Ally: I check it.
Brennan: You have a message on Reddit.
Ally: I check it. I check it.
"Brennan: In response to your last message, which was Get well soon."
[Emily and Siobhan laughing]
"Ally: I'm looking down with my huge glasses. I'm like,"
Margaret: Still got it.
"Ally: All right, what does this say?"
Emily: You're looking at your phone through your sunglasses.
Ally: I'm leaning against the wall.
"Siobhan: Inside, in this dark, like, invertebrate house where they don't have the lights on."
"Brennan: Three sentence, or three statements, each of which end with just a simple period. You're in danger. Get off the Griivarr worlds. Now."
Brennan: Barry.
Murph: Mm-hmm.
Brennan: Leaping from a corner of the invertebrate house and hitting you square in the side for 18 points of damage.
Emily: Crap.
Brennan: As you feel something sharp punch through your armor. Give me a Strength saving throw.
Murph: No time to go into the zone.
"Brennan: You see someone leaps out of the side, you go prone on the floor, and someone puts a knife up to your throat. You see straddling you is Hogg Cobb, who goes—"
Barry Syx: You fucking moron.
"Hogg Cobb: Where's the fuckin' Princeps, man?! I know which Barry you are, Barry. You're Barry Syx."
Barry Syx: Look which armor I have on.
Hogg Cobb: Yeah!
Barry Syx: Barry Nyne?
Hogg Cobb: What?
Barry Syx: Who Barry Nyne really is? Dude?
Hogg Cobb: What?
Barry Syx: Or is there something else going on here? Is this tour guide actually a tour guide?
Hogg Cobb: Where's the fucking Princeps at?!
Barry Syx: The Princeps… is in the zone. [Murph mimes putting sunglasses on]
Murph: And I can do a bonus action…
[cast laughing]
Murph: …And try to kick this dude's ass.
Ally: Means nothing to anybody else.
Murph: Nothing Barry just said means anything to anyone.
Zac: Laying down on the ground putting sunglasses.
Brennan: All right. We're gonna move from there.
"Ally: Wait, but before we do, can I please, on the comms device, say,"
Margaret: I just got a very scary message and we have to get off the Griivarr worlds immediately.
Murph: Also Barry is being killed.
Margaret: Also Barry's being attacked.
"Brennan: As you and Hogg start to go at it, you go on the comms, give that message. As you come off that message, you hear something scramble on the comms and hear Zortch's voice yelling something sounding far away from their comms device, and you hear a noise of, like, struggle and, like, something going on."
"Ally: It was on our ship, right?"
"Siobhan: He's on our ship, and so is Gnosis."
Emily: Can I do an Insight if it is Loose Duke?
"Brennan: Okay, give me Insight."
Ally: Oh my fucking god.
"Murph: Oh my god, Emily."
[Emily groans]
Emily: I won't believe it till I crit. That was an eight.
"Brennan: Sorry, what did you roll?"
Emily: I rolled a 19.
Brennan: It's every possibility it is Loose Duke.
Emily: I don't believe anything you say!
Brennan: Could absolutely be Loose Duke. Gunnie.
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: You're about three back from the snack shop, so the menu up on the…"
[Emily laughs]
"Brennan: Emily, are you okay?"
Murph: She had just taken a sip. Cut to Gunnie with no comms.
[cast laughing]
Murph: Getting treats.
"Ally: Yeah, what the fuck. Getting a maple cake."
"Lou: We came to B.O.B's Fantanimalland, we're gonna have a Fantanimal, we're gonna do this. We're gonna do the day right."
"Brennan: So you're about, you are now… There's a person at the register, and then there's one other person and then you, so you got, perfect view of the menus. Are you taking this time to, like, really scan the menu?"
Lou: Can I do a Perception check to see what people around me are eating? I wanna know what the good thing is.
"Brennan: Yeah, gimme an Insight check."
"Ally: If you crit on this, I'm gonna fucking walk off."
Lou: No crit. That is just a flat eight.
"Brennan: You're looking around. I mean, it seems…"
Zac: Get some bad treats.
"Brennan: It seems like most people here are getting the maple cakes, like that's—"
Lou: Can I tap the person in front of me?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
"Gunnie: Hey, what are you getting? What's the good… I've never been here before, but I've always wanted to be here, and what's, like, the thing to get? Like, what's the thing, like, I would be upset if I left and I hadn't had it?"
"Person: Oh, well, I think we're all getting something."
"Gunnie: Ah, hey, thank you."
[cast laughing]
Brennan: You see—
Lou: I'm just gonna ask the cashier.
"Brennan: By the way, as you, the person you tap in front of you, as they turn around, they have a full, they're wearing, like, a weird black ribbed turtleneck sweater and have a full, you didn't see it from behind. They have a little sort of jaunty, black beret, and as they turn around, they have a full gas mask. Like one of those blacked out eyes, like, trunk, like, little elephant trunk looking thing. Turn around and just go like… You see that as you sort of go, they don't turn back around to face the front."
Gunnie: You having a fun day?
"Gas-Masked Person: Place seems a little sort of passe to me, sort of like it's kitsch, but it's not aware that it's kitsch."
"Gunnie: I feel like I like that about it, you know? I feel like it's important to still have some kitschy parts of the world that are like, “We do this and we're pure,” and, like, you know, you can go do your, like, hardcore thing over here, but, like, here, it's just, this is for everybody, you know?"
"Brennan: You hear a voice behind you. Behind you there is an identically dressed and gas masked person who says,"
Gas-Masked Person: What are your top five favorite albums?
"Gunnie: Wait, what was that one hit on the radio, like, a couple years back? That they were, like, playing all the time? What's that song? It's like—"
"Brennan: He says,"
"Gas-Masked Person: Oh, “Tag Along with the Tachyon”?"
"Gunnie: Yes! I loved that one. Also, you guys together? I can go behind. I got time."
Gas-Masked Person: What makes you think we're together?
"Gunnie: You dress the same. I mean, I don't know if that's just a coinci… Was that rude? Sorry. But I really do love “Tag Along with the Tachyon.” That album is kind of number one, I play that a lot. But I really haven't had, I haven't been listening to music for a while now."
Brennan: You see one of them just pulls the pin on a grenade on his body.
[Murph laughing]
Gunnie: What's going— Is that… Is that a grenade?
Gas-Masked Person: It means what you take away from it.
"Gunnie: Is that, are we gonna, are you, is that… Okay, is that… Hold on. This… I just want cake. Are you about to blow up?"
"Brennan: The person in front of this guy, like, gets their food and leaves. You see the cashier in, like, a little paper hat, just kind of pokes their head around."
Lou: Okay.
Cashier: Take the next in line.
Lou: You haven't exploded yet. And I really want this cake. Can I do a Perception check to see how real that grenade is?
Brennan: The grenade actively starts to smoke red smoke in front of you.
"Lou: Like, in an ‘about to explode’ way? Or—"
"Brennan: Just, like, it starts a little puffs of red smoke and starts to sort of ooze out more."
Gunnie: That's very nice. And to me it means that you like violence.
Lou: And I'm gonna turn around and walk up to the cashier.
"Brennan: Amazing. You walk around to the cashier and the cashier says,"
"Cashier: Hi, what can I get you?"
"Gunnie: Hey, so what's the thing that, like, I would be upset if I, like, left the Griivarr Worlds and I never had it? What's, like, the thing?"
Cashier: I think you— Is this your first time to the Fantanimalland?
Gunnie: Yes.
"Cashier: Well, I would say…"
"Brennan: [hissing] Smoke, smoke, smoke."
"Cashier: I would say if it's your first time at Uncle B.O.B's Fantanimalland, I have my favorite thing on the menu, but I would say… [coughing] I would say you have to get the maple cake just to have it."
"Gunnie: Okay, got it."
"Cashier: You gotta get it just to have it. But I actually love the chili cheese fries here. Full disclosure, I'm not a sort of sweets person, more a savory person."
Gunnie: 100%.
Cashier: So I do… [passes out]
Brennan: Give me a Constitution saving throw.
Emily: Oh!
Ally: No!
"Emily: I knew it when you mentioned Guernica art squad in that newsreel, I was like, “That's gonna come into play.”"
Lou: That's that's a 13.
Brennan: You feel yourself start to go under.
Lou: Can I use the Defiant feat?
Emily: Please do.
Brennan: Yes you can. You gotta hit a two.
Lou: That's a three.
Brennan: Okay. You stay up.
Ally: Oh my god.
Zac: Get the cakes and get out of there!
"Brennan: You hear one of the dudes go to a comm and say,"
"Gas-Masked Person: Mama Bear, we got him."
Brennan: And are gonna make two Athletics
checks to try to grab you.
Lou: Okay.
Brennan: Give me two Athletics. You can do Acrobatics or Athletics.
Lou: Okay. I just wanted the cake.
Siobhan: Mama Bear.
"Ally: Yeah, let's meet Mama Bear."
Zac: Can I roll to see if any fatherly instinct just kicked in?
"Brennan: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
Emily: Can I give him the help action? 'Cause I did say I was also canonically—
"Lou: First one, because of the fatherly bond between me and Skip, I get a"
"nat 20 on the first attempt. And that's a 19 on the second attempt. Natural 19, higher than 20."
Brennan: You swat both of them away. It is your turn.
Lou: I'm gonna activate my jet pack and go straight up 40 feet and try and do a Perception check to see where my friends went.
Brennan: Give me a Perception check.
Lou: That's a nat 20.
Brennan: Incredible. Incredible.
Lou: With the bad dice.
"Ally: We're back, baby. The ball is rolling uphill."
Lou: The ball is rolling up!
"Emily: With a nat 20, could he have, with an object interaction, grabbed one maple cake?"
Ally: A maple cake?
Lou: Please let me have it.
Emily: One.
"Brennan: You can grab a maple cake, if you would like."
"Lou: Gunnie fully wants to get out of this situation, sees a maple cake, grabs it, is gonna be like,"
Gunnie: One sec.
"Lou: Grabs it, and then blasts off."
Brennan: Give me a Stealth check.
Lou: Okay.
Siobhan: Do we have stealth on?
Ally: Stealing at the Griivarr World.
Zac: How is that a bigger deal than—
Emily: I don’t think so.
Lou: That's an 11.
Brennan: 11\. Huge alerts.
Alert Voice: Stop! Shoplifting! Stop! Shoplifting!
Gunnie: He knocked people out! What's happening?
Brennan: You see a couple of Vercadian protector androids.
"Emily: That's good, though."
Lou: God damn.
"Brennan: Riva, you are in the water, what are you doing down there?"
"Siobhan: I am gonna Message… 'Cause I have Mind Link, I can Mind Link to Gunnie knowing that he doesn't have comms."
"Riva: Just so you know, there's some bad stuff that's happening."
"Gunnie: Oh, I know now, okay."
"Riva: Oh, okay, okay, great. So we're just on the same page."
"Gunnie: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Siobhan: Can I see anything that's happening right now? Can I, in my swimming around in this fountain, am I within, like, visual distance of anybody?"
Brennan: This is all happening in different places throughout Fantanimalland.
"Siobhan: How far away am I from, say Lou?"
Brennan: I'm gonna roll this and times it by a hundred feet.
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: You're 700 feet away.
"Siobhan: Oh my god, that's so far."
Brennan: Yep.
"Siobhan: God, Jesus."
Zac: Are you in your robot or your real body?
Siobhan: I'm in my robot body.
"Brennan: Or I think if you're swimming, you're probably in your Aguatunisian body, right?"
"Siobhan: No, I came here in my drone. I'm swimming in the drone."
"Brennan: Okay, amazing, perfect, perfect."
"Siobhan: It's not very good at it. Mostly floating and then, like…"
"Ally: Yeah, it's just, like, sloshing as you move."
"Siobhan: I definitely am gonna get outta here and there's just, like, water still in there and, like, forever I'll be sloshing. How far away am I from these guys and how far away am I then from the invertebrate house? From the elevator and from, 'cause…"
"Brennan: You're about 1200 feet from the invertebrate house, from the elevator, you're 1900 feet."
"Siobhan: Is there anybody bad where I am? Can I do a Perception check for, like, bad people near this fountain? Because…"
"Brennan: Yeah, gimme a Perception check for bad people."
Siobhan: Nat 20.
"Lou: Welcome to the corner, all right?"
Ally: Wow.
Lou: We hold it down here.
Siobhan: I think this is my first crit of the season.
"Ally: I mean, honestly, finally."
"Emily: If you don't see anyone, you could deactivate and go back to the ship."
"Siobhan: I could, yeah."
Emily: Since Zortch is getting attacked.
Siobhan: That's a great point.
Brennan: You sense a lot of psychic danger. You sense a lot of psychic danger coming from Gunnie. You sense psychic danger coming
"from off in the direction of the reptile house, and Skip and Sid are actually kind of dropping off of your ability to perceive them. Additionally, yeah, you feel, psychically you feel, you have all these coins in your hand, which actually are resonating very powerfully to you psychically, because each coin is connected to a wish that was made here. So you feel a lot of, like, the psychic energy here in the fountain. There's chaos. What are you gonna do?"
"Siobhan: Since I am so far away from everybody… I think you're right, I think I have to yell over comms and Mind Link, like,"
"Riva: Grab my drone as you leave, please. I think it's time for a hot exit."
Siobhan: And I go back to the ship.
"Brennan: You return back to the ship, open your eyes to see at the pilot station, in gold armor, Barry Nyne with a ray pointed right at you."
"Barry Nyne: Morning, sweetheart."
Brennan: And pulls the trigger.
[cast groaning]
Brennan: I am going to need—
Zac: Through the glass?
Brennan: I am going to need a Wisdom saving throw.
Emily: I am glad you’re back to defend yourself.
"Siobhan: Great, I roll that with advantage. And thank goodness. That is 16 plus eight, 24."
Brennan: Okay. You are going to take half damage.
Ally: Oh no.
Siobhan: That’s a lot of dice.
"Brennan: 10, 13…"
Emily: Oh no.
Brennan: 22…
Emily: And Aurora wouldn't even attack because Barry Nyne looks like Barry Syx.
Brennan: 30 halved to 15 points of damage to you.
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: You see that there's some kind of krystal weaponry in his hand that is specifically, you can tell that it does…"
Siobhan: It's like psychic damage?
"Brennan: Yeah. Oh, do you have resistance to psychic damage?"
Siobhan: I do have resistance to psychic damage.
Brennan: So that's going to be halved again.
"Siobhan: Great, so seven."
"Brennan: Yes, seven damage to you."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Brennan: You take seven points of damage. Whatever this gun is is clearly, like, meant to really hurt psychically adept people."
"Siobhan: I still have my turn, right?"
Brennan: Still have your turn.
Siobhan: It was a bonus action to get back to the ship. Can I just Phasewalk to a different room?
"Brennan: Yeah, you wanna get off the bridge?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I just wanna be not on the bridge where Barry Syx is. Oh wait, no I can't, 'cause that's a bonus action."
Brennan: That's a bonus action. But you have an op— you could just swim straight down into the water system of the ship and get out of the bridge.
"Siobhan: Great, I will use my movement to get off the bridge and then I will… Do I sense that Barry Nyne has psychic powers, or this is just a psychic gun?"
Brennan: Psychic gun. You don't think he has psychic powers.
"Siobhan: Okay, great. Then I will…"
Zac: Barry is psychic.
Lou: Just floating Barry.
"Siobhan: I will use Improved Feedback on Barry Nyne. So I just Mind Link to him and, and say,"
"Riva: You know, on a scale of your choice, how well do you think this interaction is going?"
"Siobhan: And because of that, he has to do an Intelligence saving throw, and on a failed save takes damage."
Brennan: Intelligence saving throw.
Siobhan: Intelligence saving throw.
Emily: I'm hoping that he's got some—
Murph: But he might have cerebro—
Siobhan: That's what I'm thinking. He might have cerebro stats.
Murph: He might have both.
Brennan: He fails the save.
Siobhan: Great.
"Emily: Yeah, baby."
"Siobhan: Okay, he takes eight points of damage and must immediately use his reaction, if available, to move as far as his speed allows away from me."
Brennan: You hit him with his feedback. [groans] He goes…
Barry Nyne: [groaning]
Brennan: You see a huge— Leaps over the bulb of water on the bridge and begins to sprint down the staircase. We're gonna cut back to Uncle B.O.B's Fantanimalland.
[Emily groans]
"Brennan: Barry and Margaret, what are you doing… It's your turn now, Barry, you go into the zone."
"Murph: Sweet. I'm sort of, like, grappling with Cobb, right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
"Murph: Sweet. I guess I will, so that I can use a rotary cannon, I'll push him, I'll take the opportunity attack to push him off and I pull out a huge gun."
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: And then I'll just make… The way Rapid Attack works is that…
Brennan: He makes a Dex save and you do double damage if you hit.
"Murph: And if he passes, does he take half or he takes none?"
Brennan: He takes none.
Murph: Okay.
"Ally: Well, I would still do it, 'cause I… Oh wait, no, no, sorry."
"Murph: You're there, do you have a thing to do?"
"Ally: I do have things, I do have things."
"Murph: Maybe I'll hold until after Marge, then."
"Ally: Well no, I can goose your attack roll or I can try and use…"
Murph: Do you have a way to hurt his save?
"Ally: Yes, I can, my bonus action, I'll put my Critical Analysis to him, and then if it's against a hostile creature… No, this also just adds to damage attacks against him."
Murph: Okay. Then I will just do regular attacks.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: And I'll do Reckless.
Brennan: Go for it.
Murph: Jesus Christ. Only a 13 to hit on the first one.
Ally: I'll do a Targeted Strike. I add a d6 to that.
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: Six.
"Brennan: Oh, that hits, 19 hits."
"Ally: And now you add that six to the damage roll, too."
Murph: Incredible.
Brennan: Wow.
Murph: Okay. I'll just roll both.
Zac: That's good.
Murph: And then a 27 to hit.
Brennan: 27's definitely gonna hit.
Ally: Hell yeah.
"Murph: Okay, so I add a d6 on the first one. Seven, nine… 14, 17… 23 damage on the first attack."
Brennan: Gotcha.
Murph: And then… 17 damage on the second attack.
Brennan: 23 and 17?
Murph: Yeah.
Brennan: 40 damage all told?
Murph: Uh-huh.
"Brennan: You light Hogg up. [gunfire noises] [groans] Still standing, but badly, badly hurt."
"Murph: Bonus action, I'm just going to jump 30 feet straight in the air and come down and do my five damage punch to him."
Brennan: Incredible.
Zac: It's like a Zack Snyder movie.
"Ally: Yeah, exactly."
"Brennan: Boom! He gets knocked on his ass. Pow. Margaret, your turn."
Ally: So he's not down but he's looking bad.
Brennan: Not down. Looking quite bad.
Ally: Okay. I'll shoot him with my blaster pistol. Is that smart? It only does a d4. Should we just get the fuck out?
Murph: We need to kill this guy.
"Ally: Okay, you know what, I am going to…"
"Brennan: You can add your analysis to him, right? You can do that as a bonus action."
"Ally: I can, and that just helps me hit."
"Brennan: Gotcha, yeah, yeah."
"Ally: Okay, so instead I am going to… I am gonna get… I'm gonna get kind of close to him. And shoot, fuck it, I'll just shoot him with my blaster pistol."
Brennan: Go for it.
"Ally: So bonus action, I will do the, he becomes the focus of my Critical Analysis. So my damage rolls use my Intelligence modifier instead of Strength. So… Fuck. That is a seven to hit."
Brennan: Seven does not hit.
[Lou laughing]
"Ally: Okay, then I'm gonna… Can I kind of cover my mouth? Is it loud in here? It's loud."
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah."
"Ally: I just wanna, I'm gonna say,"
"Margaret: Barry, I have this ability and I need your consent for it, but if someone attacks me, I can call you to intervene."
"Barry Syx: Oh yeah, right on."
"Margaret: And if you get hit, if they miss on you, then you get to hit 'em right away and we can just kill him that way."
Barry Syx: That's awesome.
"Ally: Okay, so I'm gonna kinda, outta the side of my mouth, do that, and then I'm gonna go…"
Margaret: You're so stupid. You could never hit me.
Ally: And then I'm gonna take out my phone and reply to that Reddit thing.
"Brennan: Okay, give me an Intimidate check."
Emily: You're so stupid.
Ally: You're so stupid.
[Emily laughing]
Ally: It's a 27.
Murph: Whoa.
"Brennan: You see he looks at you and goes,"
Hogg Cobb: I'm so stupid?! Well then how come I'm gonna kill you both? [pause] Gah!
[cast laughing]
Ally: The down time between the leap is so funny!
"Brennan: You see, he's gonna jump and take a swing at you."
"Ally: Boom, bonus action."
"Murph: He has to hit for it to happen, right?"
"Ally: No, no, you're a willing creature. My reaction is you are stepping in front of me, so you either get hit, or if he misses, then you get to hit him right away."
Murph: Got it.
Brennan: He misses you badly.
Murph: Rad.
Ally: Thank God.
Murph: 24.
Brennan: That will do it.
Ally: I get to roll a superiority die and also add this to the damage.
Emily: Ooh!
Ally: 5.
Murph: Oh my god. 18… 23 damage.
Brennan: 23 with the five added in there?
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see he goes,"
Hogg Cobb: Gah!
"Brennan: And you just step in and punch him so hard in the head that he's dead. You go, crack! Bam. Hogg Cobb is dead. He never even got his jet pack back."
"Margaret: Thanks, bae."
"Ally: Oh, can we take the jet pack? Oh no, he was trying to get it, oh, right, right."
Emily: Does the jet pack die when Hogg Cobb dies?
Zac: I just start falling through a tunnel.
"Brennan: Bad timing, that'll happen."
Margaret: We get the fuck outta here?
Barry Syx: Yeah. Let's get to…
Brennan: Both of you give me Perception checks.
Murph: Okay.
Zac: Whoa.
"Ally: Hell yeah, 24."
"Murph: Oh, nice. 21."
"Brennan: Both of you, as you look at each other like, “Get the fuck out of here,” you hear it. Blood oozing out of Hogg Cobb's ears, you see, drowns out the comm device in his ears, and the last thing you hear is,"
"Barry Nyne: Fish, jump back to the ship. I'm grabbing the Princeps and getting the fuck outta here. Meet me back at the ship."
"Murph: Let me… I want to grab the mic and I put it on and I go,"
"Barry Syx: Listen, you piece of shit Barry. You're not the real Barry. Barry's inside. Barry, if you can hear me, I'm coming for you. Barry worm, I'm coming for you too, but in a different way, to fuck you up, Barry style."
[cast laughing]
: Barry style.
Ally: Barry worm.
Emily: Barry worm!
"Ally: I like to think that even the cerebro-slug is like, “Oh, fuck, ah.”"
"Brennan: Incredible. So both of you hightail it outta there. Gunnie, we're gonna come back to you real quick."
Lou: Yeah.
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Wait, do we wanna go to the ship or do we wanna try to find people in the elevator that we heard them—"
Murph: I wanna try to make sure everybody's okay.
"Emily: Well, we're definitely hearing—"
"Murph: I would assume, since Gunnie's by himself, I wanna run and try to find Gunnie."
Ally: Cool.
"Lou: I mean, you should hopefully see me floating about 40 feet up in the air, just desperately looking around. That nat 20 Perception check."
Brennan: Yes.
Lou: Does that let me see the two of them?
"Brennan: Yes. You see them running out of the reptile house. I'm gonna say on that nat 20, Gunnie, you rush right up to these two."
Lou: Great.
Gunnie: We're outta here?
"Barry Syx: All right, I think we gotta get outta here."
"Murph: I think send a comm message to these two guys, 'cause they're faster than us, and be like,"
Barry Syx: Meet you back at the ship?
Skip: Right on.
"Gunnie: Also some real, like, alty dudes are here and I think they're trying to capture me?"
Barry Syx: There's more people?
"Gunnie: Yeah, and they have grenades that knock you out and they're being controlled by Mama Bear."
"Brennan: You guys see a little plinking, in the middle of the three of you, a little plinking grenade lands with a little thing in French that says, This is not a pipe."
Ally: I kick it. I kick it as hard as I can.
Brennan: It's gonna go off and I'm gonna need Constitution saving throws from you all.
Lou: What?
[Emily sighs]
"Emily: Just don't let this sour you on grenades, 'cause I actually really need to get more."
Ally: Nice.
Brennan: 19.
Lou: 25.
Ally: Eight.
"Brennan: Marge, you go to kick it. Smoke right in your nostrils."
Margaret: I never played soccer.
"Brennan: You guys see Marge is out. There are about four of these, like, sweater gas mask dudes."
Murph: I'll grab Marge and let's get outta here.
"Lou: Yeah, let's run."
Brennan: Cool. You guys take off.
"Siobhan: Grab me too, please."
"Brennan: Okay. Yes, and also the psychodrone."
Lou: You got both?
"Murph: Yeah, can I get to the psychodrone?"
"Lou: Yeah, how far off is the psychodrone? And can we buy a new one?"
"Brennan: I'm gonna say, that nat 20 Perception, it is within grabbing distance of you."
Lou: I'll grab it. Can I carry it?
"Brennan: Yes, you can carry it, yes, yes, yes."
Lou: It's so heavy.
Brennan: It's so heavy.
"Siobhan: It's full of water. It's like a kayak that just rolled and will always have, like, a layer of water."
Brennan: Incredible. You guys cannot get Sid or Skip on your comms.
"Emily: Oh, so we don't even know any of this is going down?"
Brennan: Don't know any of it's going down.
Emily: You don't think that we feel the earth shakin' from all these grenades?
Brennan: I don't think you feel it.
"Ally: Where are you going, where are you going?"
Lou: I think we need to get back to the Princeps more than—
"Emily: Okay, but I did hear Zortch, though. I did hear Zortch, right?"
"Brennan: You were the first people to say anything and you said you were going down. So it's up to these guys here. You came in first saying, “Me and Skip are going down to investigate.”"
Emily: So I didn't even hear the stuff with Zortch?
Brennan: Didn't even hear the stuff with Zortch.
"Emily: Dammit, I was gonna try and call through Zortch's comm and tell Aurora to save the Princeps."
Siobhan: I have a plan.
"Brennan: So, that's gonna be— Sid and Skip, we're gonna come to you in a second. We're just gonna resolve this. Gunnie and Barry, it's up to you. You have a psychodrone and an unconscious Marge. Do you go looking for Sid and Skip, who are not responding to comms right now, 'cause they're deep underground?"
Gunnie: They keep throwing grenades at us.
Barry Syx: All right. I'll trade you. You take Marge to the ship. I'll take the drone and go look for those guys.
"Gunnie: Okay. Yeah, sure."
Alert Voice: Warning! Warning! Return maple cake at once!
[cast laughing]
"Gunnie: Fuck it, fine!"
Lou: I throw it.
"Brennan: You see a 12 foot tall Vercadian protector droid goes,"
Vercadian Protector Droid: [boop] Thank you. Please enjoy the rest of your time at Uncle B.O.B's Fantanimalland.
"Gunnie: Well, now I'm not…"
Lou: [laughing]
Emily: Was it the Vercadian protector droid from inside that—
Brennan: Looks like a different Vercadian droid.
Lou: I'll take Marge and do a bonus action dash and then action dash to start heading back toward the ship.
"Brennan: As you go, you see the Vercadian droid looks at the maple cake and says,"
Vercadian Protector Droid: Would you like to purchase a maple cake?
Gunnie: Yes!
Vercadian Protector Droid: All right.
Brennan: Sort of starts fumbling around in the giant…
"Gunnie: I can't, I can't…"
"Brennan: You see he says,"
Vercadian Protector Droid: That'll be two credits.
"Gunnie: I don't have time, I have to go. I have to… Can we do this quick?"
"Vercadian Protector Droid: Oh, would you like an escort out of the park?"
Gunnie: Will you escort me out?
Brennan: You see a bunch of Guernican Art Squad people start firing on you and this protector droid throws up this insane shield in front of you. [imitating blaster fire]
Vercadian Protector Droid: This customer's engaging in a transaction.
"Lou: Okay, can we, I'm just gonna start slowly walking back, being like,"
"Gunnie: All right, gimme one second. It’s in my… Keep going, okay. It's in my…"
Ally: I'm just dangling.
"Gunnie: It's in my pocket, it's in my pocket."
"Vercadian Protector Droid: Absolutely, sir."
Gunnie: One second.
Vercadian Protector Droid: Would you like frosting?
"Gunnie: Yeah, oh, definitely. I'm gonna want all the toppings. Come on, come on. More bananas, extra bananas."
Lou: I hate bananas.
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: You literally get to the door of the park with this Vercadian droid finally like,"
"Vercadian Protector Droid: All right, pistachios, extra fudge, bananas, whipped cream, vanilla and icing."
"Gunnie: Yes, great."
Vercadian Protector Droid: Thank you. [card swiping noises] [chime] Approved!
"Brennan: Great. It comes out to, like, five credits with all the toppings."
Lou: So expensive. And I don't even want— I can't eat pistachio.
[cast laughing]
Siobhan: Gunnie's also allergic to tree nuts.
"Ally: Do we know if, like, Ronnie Kwan sees me being pulled in unconscious towards our ship? Like, did he let these people get onto our ship?"
"Brennan: We don't know. That information is not available to you guys right now. You head for the elevator shaft. Riva, you feel, you're in the water systems, but psychically, you can sense Barry Nyne running through the ship."
Siobhan: Great. I would like to cast Hallucination on Barry Nyne.
Brennan: Hell yes.
Siobhan: It's a Wisdom saving throw.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Siobhan: Please go ahead and do the Wisdom saving throw and then I will tell you, if it fails, what happens."
"Ally: Ooh, who's the DM now!"
[cast laughing]
Siobhan: Who is the daddy now!
"Ally: Who's the daddy now, go ahead and roll and then I'll tell you, bitch."
Lou: Who's the daddy now?
Siobhan: I don't give away my secrets.
Zac: He hallucinates that he's dead.
Brennan: What happens to Barry Nyne?
"Siobhan: Great. I would like for him to hallucinate the Princeps just being right in front of him, like, passing through the door in front of him, all the way to the escape pod, which is where we've been keeping Aurora Nebbins."
Brennan: Incredible.
Emily: My baby girl.
"Brennan: Okay. Amazing. You create that, and he says,"
"Barry Nyne: What, you're awake?"
"Brennan: And you hear,"
"Barry Nyne: Oh, I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you."
Brennan: I'm going to now roll a Luck check here real quick.
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: That's a 14. You feel him stop. Psychically, he's in a room, and you realize he's in a room with the unconscious Princeps Zortch."
"Siobhan: Ah, shit."
Brennan: Give me another Wisdom saving throw.
Siobhan: 27.
"Brennan: Okay, you are once again gonna take a quarter damage here."
"Siobhan: Great. Oh my god, that's still so many dice."
"Brennan: Oh Jesus. 12, 22, 28, 31… That's gonna be another seven"
"points of damage to you. As— You feel, like, this— He's basically producing a cone, and you see he says,"
"Barry Nyne: Nice try, fish! I know there's only supposed to be one of people."
Siobhan: I… This is a little spicy. Can I use my Subtle Control to make him forget that he saw the body of the Princeps?
"Brennan: Sure. There's a Wisdom roll here. He's gonna do that right now. Hold on one second. The Subtle Control works. He goes,"
"Barry Nyne: Hey, there you are. No, get over here, you."
Brennan: And he— Once again hear him running through the ship.
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: Towards the escape pod.
[Siobhan sighs]
Siobhan: The Riva versus Barry Nyne fight was not something that I was expecting.
"Brennan: Yeah, I know. I'm gonna need you to roll initiative for Aurora Nebbins, if you'd be so kind."
"Emily: Yay! Okay, she got a 14, but I don't know what she adds to it. I don't have stats for her."
"Siobhan: Yeah, what's Aurora's Dex like?"
"Brennan: Oh, I have Aurora's."
Zac: Probably good.
"Brennan: Aurora's Dex, oh, actually Aurora's Dex is only plus one."
"Siobhan: Oh, strong."
"Brennan: Strong, she's a strong girl."
"Emily: Oh, so 15."
"Brennan: Or— So you see Barry says,"
"Barry Nyne: Oh, phase walking through the door, huh? [door opening noise] Oh, shit!"
"Brennan: And Aurora Nebbins can attack first. I'll tell you what to add here. So you're gonna add, it's plus six and it's two bite attacks."
"Emily: Okay. The first one is not gonna hit, unless a nine hits."
Brennan: Does not.
"Emily: Come on, Rick Perry die."
Ally: Oh!
Lou: Was it rolling that whole time?
Ally: It was rolling that whole fucking time.
"Brennan: I'm gonna need, Barry Nyne's gonna go into the zone. I'm gonna need a Athletics check. You're adding plus four to this."
Lou: What is he doing?
Emily: 18.
Siobhan: He's a little spicy thing.
"Brennan: You see Barry Nyne does not hurt… Your wording was the hallucination runs into the escape pods, correct?"
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: You feel that is very cleverly worded. 'Cause what happens next is this. Barry Nyne grabs Aurora Nebbins, does not hurt her, hurls her out of the escape pod, closes the door and says,"
"Barry Nyne: Thanks for the ride, fish!"
Brennan: Boom. And the escape pod rockets off The Wurst into the sky.
"Siobhan: Okay, well—"
"Emily: Oh, but he thinks that—"
Siobhan: He thinks he's got the Princeps.
Emily: The Princeps is in it.
"Siobhan: So I'll comms to everybody like,"
"Riva: Well, the good news is that Barry Nyne isn't here, and we'll get to the bad news when you get back, 'cause we… it's… It'll be fine. It'll be fine. The good news is he's not here."
Barry Syx: I also consider that bad news.
"Riva: Oh, okay."
Barry Syx: 'Cause I wanna pull the worm out of his head.
Riva: Well.
Barry Syx: Just bad news.
Riva: Okay.
Barry Syx: Right on.
Riva: Great.
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: Amazing. Wild, you fought Barry Nyne on The Wurst! Some clever spellcasting from the ship's psychic. Gunnie, you're heading back to the ship with Margaret's body, you have your nice maple cake. You rush over there. As you're trying to get to the elevator shaft, you see that there are these, like, Guernican Art Squad people all around. I am going to need, on your way there one more time, I'm gonna need a Constitution saving throw."
Murph: Don't be bad.
Siobhan: Barry cannot be carried.
Murph: 13.
Brennan: Any other shenanigans you can throw?
"Ally: We all have Defiant, right?"
Brennan: No.
Murph: Not me.
Brennan: Clone trooper.
Lou: No!
Siobhan: Is that like…
Lou: I'm gone.
"Murph: Nope, I don't think so."
"Lou: Oh, they can't have him."
Emily: And we're just stupidly down a fuckin’ shaft.
"Siobhan: Gonna make you go to art school, bro. They're gonna make you. You're gonna have to learn how to do fuckin' figure drawing and shit."
"Lou: Yeah, dude. You be doing fucking nonstop—"
"Murph: Yeah, advantage on Dex saves I can see, but I don't think I can do anything about Con."
"Brennan: Barry, you can see the elevator shaft ahead of you. You are running, you have the psychodrone under one arm… [grenade dropping noises] [air hissing] Smoke. You feel yourself…collapse. You feel shapes come into the smoke around you. You hear voices going,"
"Voice: Look at this guy. So big. He's number six, it's like he's referencing numbers, but, like, where are the others? What do you think it is, sort of, like, a commentary on, like, isolation or a commentary—"
Barry Syx: It’s not…a commentary.
"Voice: Well, it's gotta be commentary on something. [distorted] It's gotta be, it's gotta be commentary on [mumbling]."
"Barry Syx: God damn you, assholes."
Brennan: Deep underground.
[cast laughing]
Siobhan: Oh boy.
Brennan: Sid and…
Emily: You are such a jerk for making us watch this happen and then…
"Ally: I mean, I thought Aurora Nebbins was about to get iced. And so I am like, no."
Emily: That's true.
Ally: You are being quite kind.
"Emily: But I mean, you destroyed all of our friends and we couldn't do anything!"
Zac: We're in a dumb tube.
Emily: We're in a dumb tube!
Ally: We got cocky and we split up.
"Brennan: Hey, you know, it is what it is."
Emily: I didn't actually mean you're a jerk.
"Brennan: No, of course. I understand. Listen, you know, these are the moments. We split up and then something bad happens to the chaotic galaxy. So. Deep under Uncle B.O.B's Fantanimalland, at the bottom of a no longer brightly colored elevator shaft. It fades from the bright greens and purples and yellows of the metallic spires of Uncle B.O.B's Fantanimalland to simple slate gray, little flickering lights. Beep beep beep beep. As jetpack and rocket boots descend and touch down. And it's damp down here. Levels beneath the surface. It is, a forgotten place within the Fantanimalland. Where do you go as you see the tunnels branch out from this place, and what is it that you are looking for?"
Emily: How many tunnels are there?
"Brennan: There are two that exit out to either side, continuing straight down, past the end of your vision, with other branching passageways coming off of them, not all of which are at right angles. There's some strange little sort of, like, K-intersections where, like, a straight tunnel will branch off, one diagonally this way and one diagonally that way as you sort of gaze down."
"Sidney: I would say, I mean, originally we came here kind of looking for Barry Nyne for Barry Syx, so that might be on my mind, but also kind of once we're in there and we saw those artifacts, I'm almost curious if those artifacts are fakes for the museum and there's a place that they actually store them."
: Okay.
"Emily: What do you think, Skip?"
"Zac: Skip is looking around and is, like, trying to decide, is this like—"
Sidney: Also what the heck happened back there?
Ally: Yeah. [laughing]
"Skip: It's complicated, but they want me and I don't want to do it right now."
[cast laughing]
"Sidney: That must be so nice to be wanted, though."
"Skip: In some ways, yes. In a lot of ways, it is extremely, he shot me in the butt."
[cast laughing]
"Sidney: I could hear you shout, “My ass!”"
[cast laughing]
"Zac: Holding, like, a theme park napkin to my butt."
[cast laughing]
"Zac: Looking around, I just wanna see, like, you said it was forgotten. It doesn't feel like, in a theme park, how they, like, have underground tunnels that they use."
"Brennan: It feels exactly like that, with the exception that Uncle B.O.B's Fantanimalland has had so many renovations and renewals and things that this feels like an old one."
Emily: Like the old characters used to take smoke breaks here.
Brennan: Yes.
"Zac: I wanna look around to see if there's any, like, costumes left down here."
Brennan: Give me an Investigation check. You both can.
"Emily: Dirty 20, nope! Dirty 21."
Zac: 16.
"Brennan: You look around and find there's some places where things have been discarded, but as you look around, something has cleaned this place out already. You look and see that a lot of the doors here that would've been shut and irised a long time ago have been burst through, and not with, like, energy weapons, but something large."
Emily: Oh no.
"Brennan: Has, like, broken through places down here."
Zac: Can I check to see if they're sort of Barry sized?
Brennan: Give me a Survival check.
Zac: Only an eight.
Emily: I'll look for… Nat 20.
[dramatic music]
"Brennan: You touch the walls here where you see incredible claw marks in the side of the wall that, like, ripped the door open. And as you touch it, you feel a resonant energy. The claw marks have no biological irregularity in the depth of striking into the side of the wall here, but instead have the uniform pressure of a synthetic organism."
"Emily: I see, so a droid. Are they 12 feet tall? Like a Vercadian?"
"Brennan: Yeah, must be, probably some kind of Vercadian or something like that."
"Emily: Can I look around with that nat 20 also to see if there's any sort of, like, spots where dust once was so it looks like someone picked this up?"
"Brennan: You see that this place is bizarrely free of dust. And as you look around, it's like something is dusting this place, perhaps accidentally. But on that nat 20…"
Zac: A Roomba?
"Brennan: Yeah, some kind of Roomba, maybe. On that nat 20—"
Emily: Is that where Vercadian droids come from?
"Brennan: You hear a kind of humming and whirring and clicking coming from deep, deep within this series of old performer tunnels. As you look around as well, you see that the reason these are sort of older is that… This is from a time prior to android usage when, like, more of these performers would've been humans wearing costumes, and it looks like the park mostly doesn't make use of that anymore. The park has kind of moved towards just employing androids. But you hear something whirring and humming deeper within these catacombs here."
"Emily: I mean, I have nothing to do but assume that our friends are right on our tails, so."
"Skip: We're in the tunnel, if you can hear us."
"Sidney: Hi, it's us. We're in the tunnel. We've got a hot lead."
"Skip: When you're done with rides, come…"
Sidney: I can only assume that you've all joined Gunnie in line to wait for maple cakes.
Ally: God dammit.
Zac: I feel like we gotta…
"Emily: What would we really do, right? We'd probably follow this whirring sound."
Zac: Yeah. I think I wanna Stealth through the tunnel to see if—
"Brennan: Give me some Stealth checks, gang."
Zac: 17.
Emily: Dirty 20.
Brennan: Okay. You make your way through these tunnels.
"Sidney: You know what I can do? Since our comms aren't working, it might make sense for me to send Handy Annie up."
Skip: Okay.
Brennan: Yeah.
Sidney: To rendezvous.
"Brennan: Yeah, that makes sense."
"Emily: Detach her, send her up."
"Brennan: Actually, yeah. For Handy Annie, give me a Perception check, with advantage."
Emily: Okay. I actually don't know what her stats are. It's a 13 and 11 on the die. I don't know what her stats are.
"Brennan: I think it's probably just a plus four. Handy Annie scoots up with the little GoPro and goes back up the elevator shaft. You two continue deeper into this area. You've rolled your Stealth rolls. You arrive at what looks like…some sort of deep basin. You're in an elevated catwalk, and this looks like some kind of water containment area. So it's that thing of a, you know, rebar sort of, or not rebar, but, like, steel grate catwalk that you can see through, ladder going down, deep underneath is this enormous, probably, like, 100-foot diameter circular chamber. The walls piled high…with bright blue animatronic mouse heads with the eyes torn out, weird banjos from country band jamborees, all these discarded cybernetic parts, and a hulking monstrosity busies itself moving amongst the piles. What you see is… Probably even hunched as it is, its posture very hunched, about a 20 foot tall thing that at first looks like it has plumage, it rustles like it has feathers, and you really realize why these hallways seem so absent of dust. Its plumage is made of tatters of garbage bags. So it has this heap-like shape to it where it is just a mound of different garbage bags, scraps, almost like the feathers of a massive bird. Its arms are completely naked of flesh, so just joint metallic claws that can extend out for, like, 20 feet each, so its, you know, reach is this sort of enormous monstrous reach, and you see amongst the sort of garbage bag plumage, a… Beautiful's not the right word. A classically rendered doll's face at the front."
"Lou: Just, like, really normal, nice things."
"Emily: I'm just whispering to the comm just between us like,"
"Sidney: I think it's like almost a sentient construct of, like, a bunch of old animatronics."
Skip: Do we think that is good? Or bad?
"Sidney: You know, Skip, I don't necessarily trust my judgment in this moment, but I think it's fuckin' awesome."
"Skip: I mean, aesthetically, awesome."
"Sidney: I'm, like, wondering if we have space on the ship for it."
Zac: I'm looking at the deep claw marks in the walls around.
"Brennan: You see that this thing is grooming itself, and as it does, you see, it pulls out a little sort of fractured head of some kind of very dirty, soiled piece of technology, goes… [mumbling] It's kind of far away, it's about, like, 80 feet down. It's, like, whispering something, and you see it sort of roots around in the pile and places this thing deep in a pile of stuff and sort of scoops the pile back up and pats it and moves over to another pile. Grooms itself."
Zac: Collecting.
"Sidney: Quite frankly, love this little creature."
Skip: It's not little.
"Sidney: I know, but its behavior is so…"
[cast laughing]
Sidney: Adorable.
[Ally laughing]
"Siobhan: Just a little added context, also, that Murph is very afraid of dolls."
Ally: Oh my god. Oh my god.
Emily: Can I do…
Ally: Barry's dead on the ground.
[cast laughing]
Emily: I sent up…
Brennan: Yes.
"Emily: Logically, we would not know that."
Brennan: You would not know.
"Ally: That's very true, very true."
"Emily: I did the most in-character thing I could do to just send Handy Annie up and hopefully I'll receive word. Can I do, like, a Perception check to see if there's, like, anything in all this old stuff that I recognize?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
Emily: Six.
Zac: A Perception check?
"Brennan: Yeah, Perception check."
Zac: That is a 12.
"Brennan: Yeah, not from up here. If you got closer, maybe."
"Skip: I have not seen much of my life, but something tells me that this thing is gonna be like, [hand motions] and then when we step on a twig, it's gonna be like, [angry hissing]"
"Sidney: Yeah, no, I kinda think you're right."
Skip: But I don't know. Do we want to at least check what the other tunnel has real fast?
"Sidney: Okay, let's go through the other tunnel."
Zac: Can we back up away from this?
Emily: I take mental pictures of this beautiful moment.
"Brennan: Okay, gimme one more Stealth check."
Ally: Oh.
Siobhan: Uh-oh.
Zac: 21.
Emily: 10 for me.
Zac: Or 22.
"Brennan: 10\. You say, “Yeah, let's go check.” Clank with one of your roller skates on the kind of ridge."
Doll-Faced Thing: [screeches]
Zac: Knew it.
[cast laughing]
Emily: It's only seen me.
"Brennan: Looks up. And it begins to rapid— so rapidly, in mechanical reference, this thing has about a speed of 80."
Siobhan: Oh boy.
Skip: Up the tunnel?
Emily: Okay. I wanna smile really sweetly and curtsy.
Brennan: Give me a Persuasion check.
Ally: Come on.
Zac: I'm hiding.
"Brennan: Give me a Stealth check. Oh wait, what's your other roll? What was your—"
Zac: It was a 22.
"Brennan: 22, okay."
Emily: 16.
"Brennan: The doll's eyes do blink, but they nictate. So they blink from the side."
Siobhan: Oh no.
"Brennan: You see a extremely grainy, its mouth does not move, but an extremely grainy recording does come from a speaker behind its stationary lips."
Doll-Faced Thing: Are you broken?
"Sidney: Depends who's answering. By my standards, I'm becoming, not broken. Your home is beautiful. I'm so sorry. There wasn't a door, and so I walked in, but I had no intention of accidentally walking into your home, but it is beautiful, I can see that. You've really built something beautiful here. What's your name? My name is Sundry Sidney, but I'm considering changing it some day, because I recently became my own droid."
Doll-Faced Thing: Did you mean what you said?
Sidney: About being broken and becoming? Or about your home?
Doll-Faced Thing: My home.
"Sidney: Oh, no, I really like it. I took a moment to sort of admire everything that was happening and the care to which you've assembled everything, I think it's aspirational. I personally am trying to build something cooler with myself and I feel like I'm watching you do it."
Doll-Faced Thing: Oh. That's very kind. You said your name was Sundry Sidney?
"Sidney: Sundry Sidney, but I'm thinking of changing it."
Doll-Faced Thing: Oh. I…don't have that of my own. But I have been called many things.
Sidney: What's your favorite thing that you get called?
"Doll-Faced Thing: Oh, I have been called the High Priestrix of the Discarded, I have been called the Junkmother, I have been called the Bag Lady, many things."
Sidney: Have you ever found remnants of a Servo Sam?
The Junkmother: Servo Sam?!
"Brennan: And she swoops down into the basin, digs through a pile, and you see takes a pair of coveralls that just have the name Sam on the outside that you recognize as a Servo Sam outfit, grabs, like, a chunk of arm, grabs something else. Is like,"
"The Junkmother: There is a great deal here, a great deal. Yes, a great, great, great deal. But that line was lost. I have no midcaps for them."
Brennan: And she puts her hand on the back of her neck.
Sidney: What's a midcap?
"Brennan: Oh, a midcap is the term for, like, the core processing krystal, like the brain."
Emily: I think I have that.
Brennan: You do.
"Sidney: I think I have that, though!"
The Junkmother: What?
"Sidney: Yeah. I was in a junkyard and I was looking around for, you know, discontinued droids, because, you know, it's lost potential! And so I picked it up, and the krystal's broken, but I have all the pieces, I think I could put it back together."
The Junkmother: You have a midcap for Servo Sam?
"Sidney: Yeah, I think so."
"Brennan: You see, she says,"
The Junkmother: Would you consider throwing it away?
"Sidney: No, I wouldn't wanna throw it away."
The Junkmother: Damn. How am I gonna get my hands on one?
"Sidney: Well, can I give it to you?"
The Junkmother: What?!
[cast laughing]
"Sidney: Okay, if I'm gonna throw it away, I'm gonna put it in a present and tie it up with a bow and then throw that away, but I can't do that to Sam's midcap."
"The Junkmother: Ooh! Well, if you don't, well, you can, but you… I suppose you could give it."
"Sidney: Yes, can I give it to you?"
The Junkmother: I've never had a gift before.
"Sidney: Well, get used to it, because once you get a gift, then you suddenly wanna start giving things, and once you start giving things more, people start giving things to you more."
The Junkmother: [laughing]
"Sidney: That's what I noticed, me and my friends, we were really dodgy with our money, but then we pooled it together and now we share all the time!"
"The Junkmother: [slowly, as if learning a new word] Shar-ing."
[Emily laughing]
"The Junkmother: Yes, yes. Point well made. Now. Would you… [clicks claws together] You haven't come here to collect and destroy all these things."
"Sidney: No, absolutely not."
"The Junkmother: No. Okay. Well, if you give it to me, then that's sort of a kind of trash."
"Sidney: I just, I really don't wanna say that about Servo Sam. I really believe in, like, that I'm excited to see Servo Sam return, so let's just not call Servo Sam trash."
The Junkmother: Trash is bad.
Sidney: How about trade?
The Junkmother: Trade?
Sidney: Would trade be better?
"The Junkmother: Oh, do you want something in exchange?"
Sidney: Yeah.
"The Junkmother: Hmm, what sort of thing do you want?"
Zac: I'm in the shadows.
Sidney: Hold on one second. Let me talk to myself about that. [quietly] Skip. What should I ask for?
The Junkmother: Do you prefer Skip? Or is that your term of address for yourself?
"Sidney: Yes, I would prefer Skip, thank you."
"The Junkmother: All right, Skip."
Skip: Hang up.
[cast laughing]
"Sidney: My name is Skip, actually, yeah."
Skip: Fuck.
"Sidney: What do you think, there's anything that we need?"
Skip: Should I come out?
"Sidney: Okay, if I… Can I invite a friend over to your beautiful house? It's someone who also is really invested in bringing Servo Sam."
The Junkmother: All right.
"Sidney: Okay, I'm gonna call them right now."
Emily: I make a fake phone. [laughing]
Ally: You psycho.
Skip: What are you doing?
"Sidney: Hey, Skip."
"Ally: I like to imagine you're, like, right there in the shadows."
Skip: Does she have her comm?
"Sidney: Would you like to… Would you like to come over, Skip? [emphatic nod]"
Skip: Okay.
"Sidney: Give me a couple beats, you know, to make it, to sell it. Okay, he's on his way."
The Junkmother: Ah. Should I go and escort him?
Sidney: He'll be here in a second.
Skip: Hi.
The Junkmother: [screams]
[cast laughing]
Brennan: You see that…
Skip: Knock knock.
Brennan: She looks at you. Give me a Persuasion check.
Zac: I don't have my gun out anymore.
Emily: Can I give the help action? Because I've been—
Brennan: Yes.
Zac: Good. Persuasion… 17.
"Brennan: She looks at you and says,"
"The Junkmother: You are not cyber form at all. You are biological, organic. What's your intention in this place?"
Skip: We saw a hole. Had to check it out.
"[Brennan, Emily and Zac laughing]"
Sidney: The biological form sometimes can be very reductive in how they describe things.
Skip: Some would say that I am similar to a cybernetic thing.
The Junkmother: In what way?
"Skip: I am little inside my body and I control this body, almost like a computer controlling a machine."
The Junkmother: Hmm. Design! Design!
Skip: Design.
Sidney: Design.
"The Junkmother: There are various designers. Some designs are for purposes. An android may never question the why of its existence. You, however, were designed by the most powerful force in the galaxy. The random factor. Survival of the fittest is the rule of evolutionary organisms. Not designed for a purpose, instead, purposed for a design. Ha!"
Skip: I understand that pretty well. I'm all about survival.
The Junkmother: Oh?
Skip: Yes.
"The Junkmother: And who has the stronger will to survive, you or the you within you, or the yous within that you?"
"Skip: Well… The plural version of you is pretty strong and after me, but the you that is within you, which is me, is doing okay, I think."
"The Junkmother: Hmm. Well, you can't spell you without yous, and to be ‘youseful’ is any android's greatest desire. Ha! You wanted a trade?"
"Sidney: Yes. I have thought about this, and I have a friend up there who is quite cybernetic, and I think he would be really happy if I could get a bar android for our casino."
The Junkmother: A Bar Buddy?
Sidney: A Bar Buddy.
The Junkmother: Bar Buddy.
Skip: Bar Buddy.
Sidney: A Barbuddy.
"Brennan: She says,"
"The Junkmother: Well, then that's that. Come down to my home. Please, please, come, come."
Brennan: And she skitters down the wall.
Emily: Am I getting anything from Handy Annie?
"Brennan: No, 'cause your comms, it's comm dead down here. I know that you have that ability. As you go down into the lower level with her, she produces a pretty mangled up, older edition, discontinued Bar Buddy. She goes,"
"The Junkmother: Bar Buddy, not android, robot. Cyber form basic. To say this was prepossessed of sentience or sapience would perhaps be a stretch, but then perhaps that is true for us all. We all have our own programming, do we not?"
Sidney: What's your programming?
The Junkmother: My programming is a rotten sludge of toxic waste. I should not exist at all.
Sidney: What do you mean by that?
"The Junkmother: Oh, you know."
"Brennan: She lifts the garbage bags at the back of her head and shows you a really badly shattered bunch of midcaps of, like, Borinyum krystals. It looks like she's maybe a series of, like, different android lines that all got jammed into this sort of, like, one body or consciousness, and she just goes…"
"The Junkmother: I think it was some kind of joke, or perhaps the people doing this were experimenting, but in any case, I escaped and they are all dead. Ah!"
Sidney: May I look at it? Because I've got some droids that I'm hoping to kind of give a little bit of mental freedom so that they can kind of decide who they wanna be rather than just being helpers.
The Junkmother: Can I look at yours?
Sidney: Absolutely.
"Brennan: You show your midcap. She goes,"
"The Junkmother: my, my, my. Oh no. No."
Zac: Can I get an Insight check?
"Sidney: What, what's wrong? What's oh no?"
The Junkmother: You are keeper.
Sidney: Yeah.
The Junkmother: The rest of your line destroyed.
"Sidney: See, I think actually there was no rest of the line, and it's maybe just me."
"The Junkmother: I am keeper as well, because I was not meant to exist. I am trash from the beginning."
Sidney: I don't think being a keeper or being the only one is trash.
"The Junkmother: No, you are keeper because it sounds as if no more were ever made. I am keeper because this…"
"Brennan: [dink dink dink] Shows the broken krystals,"
The Junkmother: …was a mistake.
"Sidney: No, it wasn't a mistake. It was a blessing. You talked about the random factor, you're living it. You're the combination of the random factor and the design."
The Junkmother: Well! I had never thought of it that way.
Sidney: Do you want another like you?
"The Junkmother: I don't know. What I want is just in these krystals, and I've never understood that any organism in the galaxy has ever been able to change what it wanted by examining what it wanted. Perhaps a fruitless endeavor. But I do very much like myself more, because if what you are saying is true, and I see no reason that it is not, then yes. What is the difference between me and another that was produced some other way? We all find ourselves produced here, and even to be designed, like you are, is, in some way, just another accident. And there's some comfort in that."
Sidney: Yeah.
The Junkmother: Well. Your Bar Buddy.
"Brennan: And she hands you this sort of broken, fucked up looking robot, has, like, a little sort of, like a tuxedo spray-painted on like a robotic bartender."
Emily: I picture Gunnie's face when I bring this to him.
Ally: Oh my god.
Emily: And I just beam.
"Sidney: You really did it this time, Sid. You really knocked it outta the park. You are gonna come out of that elevator shaft and Gunnie's gonna be there with open arms."
"Skip: When we come up the elevator, all of our friends are probably gonna be there clapping."
[cast laughing]
Sidney: I truly believe so.
"Brennan: And she says,"
The Junkmother: The trade. Servo?
Sidney: Right. So it's back on—
Emily: Do I have it on me?
Brennan: I think so. It's up to you.
"Emily: Okay, yeah. Yeah, I think I, like, reach into, like, a little apron pocket and I give Servo Sam."
"Brennan: Takes the midcap for Servo Sam. You see she digs around and finds there's barely 50% of a Servo Sam here, but she does have the overalls, legs are missing, some of the torso, one of the arms is missing, but you see that there's a head, part of the face that looks like it maybe got melted off in some kind of attack or something like that, so it's partially sort of melted here. But you see there's sort of a… Servo Sam is kind of, he's not a pleasure droid, they didn't make him to look, you know, beautiful or attractive, but he kind of has almost like a Fred Flintstoney look, it's a little bit like, “Hey, it's a normal guy!” Right? And you see that puts the midcap in and just the one eye opens."
"Servo Sam: Hey there, partner, sorry for lying down on the job. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha."
[Emily laughing]
"Sidney: Wow. I'm really just knocking it out of the park today. Hi, Servo Sam!"
"Servo Sam: Oh, hey there, Miss, how's it going? Can I fill her up for you? I don't seem to be able to stand too good."
Skip: Fill her up.
"Servo Sam: Fill her up, that's right."
"Sidney: Okay. I mean, do you wanna come with… No, you have to stay here, I made a trade. Hey, you're back. You're back, baby. And this is your new life."
Skip: So you live here now.
[Lou laughing]
Skip: You're alive and you're in this sewer.
[cast laughing]
Brennan: You see that the—
Sidney: Have I done something wrong?
Skip: It's probably fine.
"Brennan: You see that the Junkmother leans over and goes, and says,"
"The Junkmother: Well, look at this, I can't believe it. Three keepers of souls in the same basin, here deep beneath the Fantanimalland."
"Brennan: You see that Servo Sam goes,"
"Servo Sam: Wowee, keeper of souls? Now I seen everything. That's wild."
"Sidney: I think the most important thing is we need to be learning how to work on ourselves, 'cause we don't have updates we can plug into, and I think if we want to keep our souls, we need to make more of ourselves. So that's what I'm trying to learn how to make droids, and I think that with all this material down here, you two could do the same thing. I'd like to see the world filled with Junkmothers and Servo Sams."
"Ally: Oh my god, get out of here. Oh my god. Bad trip, bad trip."
"Brennan: You see the Junkmother says,"
"The Junkmother: It is very rare to find a working midcap. To think you would've ventured all the way down here into a place as forbidding as the sewers, and now a line of androids that was lost to time has returned."
"Servo Sam: Hey, not too bad. You're a pretty good fixer-upper yourself, miss."
"Sidney: I mean, if you have any more parts or krystals, I'm a bit of a traveler, and I'd love to just, you know, go around awakening old discontinued droids."
Brennan: You see—
"Sidney: It may not sound like paradise to everyone, but to my ears, whew."
"Brennan: The Junkmother looks at you and says,"
"The Junkmother: I would be honored, honored, if you would bring more here. Perhaps there could be a place in this galaxy for androids that have been discarded."
"Servo Sam: Yeah, just cuz there's better servos out there than Sam doesn't mean I don't try my best."
"Sidney: I think you're doing great, Servo Sam."
"Servo Sam: Ah, shucks. You take her easy on the road out there."
Zac: I try to put his overalls on him. It's fucked up.
"Servo Sam: Hey, easy there, fella. Buy a guy a drink first."
[cast laughing]
Skip: Sorry.
"Sidney: Okay, well, like I said, I'm a bit of a traveler, but if I'm on the road and I find other krystals and other parts, I'll bring 'em back here, whenever I can."
"Brennan: You see the Junkmother starts rooting around in the stuff and looks over at Sam and says,"
"The Junkmother: Don't worry, Mr. Sam, I'll try to find you— I don't think we have legs, but there might be some,"
"Brennan: And she finds, like, a little kind of, like, wheely garbage bin that's like a little moving garbage bin with, like, tank treads on it, and just sort of puts his torso in that and, like, wires it up real quick, and he goes,"
"Servo Sam: Golly, well, look at me, ready and raring to go."
"Skip: So you're gonna be able to use the arm part of the overalls, the rest will just dangle in the front, is that okay?"
"Servo Sam: Mister, I'm doing pretty good. We started off today not even existing anymore, and now we're back at it."
"Emily: I look at Skip and I'm like,"
"Sidney: This is paradise, right?"
Ally: Oh my god.
"Skip: Uh, y— Right on."
[cast laughing]
Ally: Would she know anything about Bob Griivarr?
"Emily: Yeah, I guess I should be like,"
Sidney: What do you know about Bob Griivarr and Griivarr World?
"The Junkmother: Oh, up there. Well, I came to be quite by accident, as you said, the random factor. And I've been living down here for a while, but I'm… I know that most biological organisms that have seen me have opened fire on sight, and I have had to either flee or kill them, defending myself."
Zac: Skip is…
"The Junkmother: No one has ever decided arbitrarily to show me kindness before. Arbitrariness is quite powerful, I have come to realize, and to be arbitrarily kind, perhaps even more so."
"Sidney: That's good to hear, because recently I heard that this world punishes people who are idealistic."
"The Junkmother: I think there is a difference, perhaps, between being ideological and simply choosing to be kind. But perhaps I'm wrong. I don't quite know. I live in the garbage and I collect parts."
Sidney: Have you met Bob Griivarr?
"The Junkmother: Oh, Uncle B.O.B. Well, his consciousness is everywhere all throughout this world, but I know that he is one of many great movers and shakers across the galaxy. It is very hard to consider the great powers of the galaxy and what they do, much easier to root around in the sewers and find things that are discarded and try to find a home for them."
"Sidney: Well, like I said, you've made a beautiful home."
Skip: Gorgeous down here.
"Sidney: Do you have a bathroom, by the way?"
The Junkmother: A bathroom?
Sidney: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see, she looks around and says,"
"The Junkmother: Well, waste is what we have here, so here, really."
"Sidney: Okay. I was kind of just curious, to be honest."
"Brennan: You see, she says,"
"The Junkmother: I will keep this place safe. I… Strange things happen all the time, I think. And I think it's all right that sometimes those strange things would be good. And this has been very strange and very good indeed."
"Sidney: I agree, and I think Skip does too."
Skip: Right on.
"Brennan: She says,"
The Junkmother: I will keep this place safe. You may return whenever you wish. And beyond just our trade.
Brennan: She roots around and takes a little data krystal. She hands it over to you.
Emily: Just put it on top of Bar Buddy.
Skip: Are you throwing that away?
"Brennan: She puts it on top of the Bar Buddy and says,"
The Junkmother: I have one of those in the bouquet of them back here.
"Sidney: So I can talk to you. If I find someone rare, I can say, “I just found this person, do you have anything?” And we can just talk about parts."
"Brennan: Well, she looks and says,"
"The Junkmother: in a sense, if you are able to communicate with me over long distances, I could open a channel through that. But rather, that is one of these. That is how I am able to find keepers."
Sidney: So I can give it to the Bar Buddy.
The Junkmother: The Bar Buddy does not have an advanced enough consciousness.
Sidney: So I could put it in myself.
"The Junkmother: If you were to add that to your midcap, you would be able like me to see when you had encountered a keeper of souls."
Sidney: Is it painful when you add something to your midcap? I've never done it before. Never gone under the knife.
"The Junkmother: Hmm. Modifying yourself in such a way that voids your warranty is frightening, but not painful."
"Sidney: Okay. Well, Skip, do you think, is there anything that you'd like to add?"
"Skip: Nothing else, really."
[cast laughing]
"Sidney: Okay. Well, I think this has been really meaningful for us both."
"Brennan: You see that you walk out with the Bar Buddy and this little midcap that will allow you to detect frequencies of, like, basically androids that are the last of their line or, like, unique androids, you'll be able to detect with this addition to your midcap. The Junkmother looks at you and says,"
"The Junkmother: Goodbye, Sundry Sidney. Your kindness was extremely bizarre, and for that reason, matters to me more than anything I can say."
Sidney: Right on.
"Brennan: Servo Sam says,"
"Servo Sam: Thanks again, miss, and I hope I see you around the ol' dusty."
Sidney: I can't wait to see you again too.
"Brennan: You guys leave, and—"
"Emily: Walk out with a skip in my step, blissfully unaware of everything going on."
"Brennan: Yeah, you get to the top—"
"Gunnie: Oh my fucking god, Barry! Barry, come in, Barry! Oh my fucking god. The killed him, they fucking killed him."
Sidney: I got a present for Gunnie.
"Brennan: You walk out, get the panicked chatter over the comms, lack of Barry, and you get Handy Annie streaming GoPro footage of an alive and unconscious Barry being transported in the back of some kind of vehicle, and Handy Annie, I rolled for it, successfully made a Stealth check to jump aboard Barry's unconscious body."
Emily: Oh!
Sidney: Skip.
"Zac: Wait, so—"
Sidney: We gotta go.
Zac: We've come up to the top.
Brennan: Come up to the top again.
Zac: Okay.
Emily: Okay. Do I see where the vehicle is?
"Brennan: Handy Annie is in the trunk of a vehicle, not getting surveillance footage of any neighborhood, but you can sense a, like, general direction."
"Emily: Then can I cast Motivator Boost on myself, which doubles my speed?"
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Emily: And then let's just try to go find him.
"Skip: Sidney, I just feel like I should say this. All the other cerebro-slugs are around, and I don't agree with them, and they're bad."
Sidney: Okay.
"Skip: If anything comes up around that topic, just know that I conscientiously object to their goal."
[cast laughing]
Skip: It is different from my goal.
"Sidney: Okay, great."
Skip: I'm just trying to hang out.
"Brennan: Amazing. So as you're going, do you hit comms with every, 'cause you guys, so Riva, Margaret, Gunnie, you're, like, halfway back to the ship where Riva's at. You also got this message from Margaret. So as you're all over comms, you're all once again aware of what's going on with Barry. What is it you all want to do?"
"Gunnie: Riva, do we have to bring the drone back for you to get into it again?"
"Riva: Yes. Yes, I have to be within,"
Siobhan: I can't remember how many feet of it.
"Gunnie: Okay, great."
Siobhan: To bonus action back into it.
"Gunnie: I mean, and Margaret's conscious again."
Ally: Am I?
Brennan: You pop back up as Gunnie's flying.
Ally: Okay.
"Emily: I definitely, I hop on the comms and I let everyone know."
Lou: Just fully drop you hard.
Margaret: Why am I covered in bananas?
Gunnie: I had to order a thing. Are you guys— Hello?
"Sidney: Hi, okay, so we actually had, like, a really beautiful moment, at least for me personally, I don't know how Skip feels, but…"
[laughing]
"Sidney: Actually, you know what? I think we were both really vibing off of it. Anyways. Barry's been kidnapped."
Gunnie: Yeah!
Sidney: Handy Annie is in the car and so we'll be able to trail them.
"Gunnie: Okay, got it."
"Sidney: Also, Gunnie, huge news, I got you a Bar Buddy."
"Gunnie: Wow, I wish I could feel joy. And I will, I will feel joy for that later. We need to get… You guys missed so much. Barry Syx, or Barry Nyne was on the ship and escape podded away. Riva did some really cool shit, so we're going back there right now, we were on the way there so that Riva can get back in the body, but then we can come and find you and then we can find Barry. If that works, I don't know."
Sidney: Okay. So Skip and I will tail this car.
"Gunnie: Great, and I don't know, maybe we'll take the ship and follow you, I don't know."
: Great.
Skip: Do you guys know how to drive the ship? Pilot?
Gunnie: Maybe.
"Skip: Okay, good luck."
Siobhan: Can I do a Medicine check on Zortch just to make sure that they're not dying?
Brennan: Yes you can. Yes.
Ally: And is Gnosis still here?
"Brennan: You guys look, Gnosis is just down in the WeWork space with some coffee mugs on it, just down on a coffee table."
Siobhan: I got an 11 Medicine check.
"Brennan: Zortch is unconscious, but you can feel them psychically. They look out and say,"
Zortch: Barry. Barry knocked me out. He was wearing gold plated armor.
"Riva: Yeah, it was the other Barry, it was the other Barry."
"Zortch: Oh, that's right. Yeah."
"Riva: There's another Barry who's actually not a Barry at all. He's one of the people that's like Skip, only bad, I think."
"Zortch: Oh, okay. Gotcha. I jumped in front of Barry to stop him from getting Gnosis, and he—"
Riva: That's very brave of you.
"Zortch: Yeah, and he smiled and knocked me out. And then…"
Riva: He was trying to steal you and not Gnosis.
Zortch: What?
"Riva: I know, I don't know."
Zortch: Okay.
Riva: He was very focused on you. That's how I got him out of here.
"Margaret: Would there be anyone who's trying to get you, to kidnap you?"
"Zortch: I mean, I am a Princeps, right? I'm a monarch."
Gunnie: I think the people at the UFTP.
"Margaret: Do you have, like, missed messages or anything, like, from your family, like all looking for you?"
Zortch: I'm unconscious right now and we're all talking through Riva.
"Margaret: Oh, my bad. I'll get off this channel."
[cast laughing]
"Brennan: But you're all psychically, yeah."
Riva: This is the unconscious channel. This is the Princeps unconscious channel.
Margaret: Looking for the gunner channel. Barry! Barry!
Lou: Can Gunnie fly this ship?
Brennan: Are you proficient in piloting?
"Lou: Yes I, no. Yes, I am."
Brennan: You're proficient in piloting.
Lou: I am proficient in piloting.
"Brennan: Yes, you can get this thing. So you see Ronnie Kwan comes aboard and goes like,"
"Ronnie Kwan: All right, man, how we looking, we good?"
Gunnie: We're gonna take it out just for a quick spin and then we'll be right back.
Margaret: Hey! Motherfucker.
Ally: Then I yell at him for…
Ronnie Kwan: What you yelling at me for?
"Margaret: Someone broke into our ship, stole our escape pod."
"Ronnie Kwan: Tough fuckin' break, that's not my problem. You got, oh, a guy with a fucking cannon the size of a scooter comes in and tells me, “Hey, I'm gonna go aboard this ship.” What, I'm supposed to say “No, I would die to defend the ships parked at my mechanic's garage”?"
"Margaret: You send me a simple text, a simple heads up."
Riva: You don't have insurance?
"Ronnie Kwan: No, what? I have insurance, yeah, insurance—"
Margaret: You’re gonna need it. [mimes punching]
"Ally: No, I don't do that. I would never, I have 11 hit points."
"Brennan: Yeah. Yeah you see Ronnie says,"
"Ronnie Kwan: Look, we got the thrusters installed, you got Mark II thrusters."
"Brennan: You see Ronnie says,"
"Ronnie Kwan: All right, all right, look, I'm sorry I let the guy board the ship. He's a clone trooper, space marine, what do you want me to do?"
"Margaret: Yeah, he's scary."
"Ronnie Kwan: He's scary, all right?"
Margaret: Yeah.
Ronnie Kwan: All right.
Gunnie: I get it.
"Brennan: He says,"
"Ronnie Kwan: Good flying out there aboard the Meridian, and again, I don't know nothing."
"Margaret: I know you don't. Hey, is anyone looking for us other than this crazy gunner person? Did you have any other people show up looking, asking questions, poking around?"
"Ronnie Kwan: Not that I could see, no."
Margaret: Okay.
"Gunnie: Hey, thanks for everything."
Margaret: Yeah.
"Ronnie Kwan: You got it, man."
"Brennan: You see that you get into The Wurst, new thrusters all along the outside of the ship, ship takes off. Yeah, I guess—"
"Lou: Gunnie's sweating bullets. Just like,"
"Gunnie: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Skip: It's a big responsibility to be flying the plane.
"Gunnie: Yeah, I know, it's scary, but I'm, Margaret's up here, Riva's up here, we're doing, I'm getting it done."
Skip: I want you to— Music off?
[the background music abruptly cuts out]
"Gunnie: Okay. Yeah, there's no music playing."
Skip: Gotta be responsible here.
"Gunnie: Yeah, of course, I'm gonna be responsible."
Skip: Check your two.
Gunnie: Okay.
Skip: Check your mirrors.
"Ally: Oh my god, taking Dad's car."
"Gunnie: Okay, we're on our way, okay?"
"Ally: I put my hand on your shoulder. My Critical Analysis is on you, like,"
"Margaret: Gunnie, you're gonna do an incredible job. Let's do this."
Skip: I'm proud of you.
"Brennan: As you're getting ready to take off, give me a Perception check."
Lou: That's a four.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Can I make—
Lou: I'm terrified. I'm trying to fly a spaceship.
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
"Ally: Perception. Ah, fuck, it's almost. That's a…13."
Brennan: Gunnie is listening to Skip's advice and has totally ignored the message that blips up on his wrist pad. It's an email from Repo Reapers.
Siobhan: Uh-oh.
Margaret: You have a message.
"Gunnie: What? Can you, I'm not allowed to check my data pad while I'm flying. Can you take a look at it?"
"Margaret: We're actively flying right now? Okay. Boop, I…"
"Brennan: You check it, so Gunnie, you don't see this. It's a message from accounts receivable at Repo Reapers saying, Mr. Miggles-Rashbax,"
"as you are aware, we have gone into repossession on several of your prosthetic cybernetic limbs. It has come to our attention that you may be in possession of a computational device. In exchange for this computational device, our legal department has advised us that we may be able to forgive your debt in total."
Ally: I delete the email.
[Zac gasps]
Gunnie: What was it?
Emily: Oh!
"Margaret: Oh my gosh, that is crazy, and something that we'll talk about as a group later."
"Gunnie: Okay, great."
[cast laughing]
"Margaret: I really believe in you, Gunnie."
Ally: I have my hand on him.
[cast laughing]
"Gunnie: Thank you, thank you."
Siobhan: Can I Uplifting Directive now that we're in the ship?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Siobhan: Great. So the ship gets plus five hull points.
"Emily: Yes, baby."
"Siobhan: But also I will give Margaret and Gunnie an Inspiring Display die so that while we're in the ship and doing ship things, at any time if you wanna roll a d6 to add to anything."
"Brennan: So, because you are not ranked as a pilot, but you do have the piloting skill, I am going to need a maneuvering check from you."
Lou: Great. Great.
Brennan: So this is a plus three to the roll here.
Siobhan: And I will give the Direct action.
Brennan: Cool. So he rolls this with advantage.
Lou: That's a six. That's a nat 20.
[cast cheering]
Ally: God.
"Brennan: Riva, what does it look like? So you would've rolled a six, Riva…"
"Riva: On the left, on the left."
"Gunnie: Okay, sorry, yeah, okay, yeah, there it is."
"Brennan: Ship takes off. Nat 20. You got it. Riva is able to replay you, like, the hundreds of times that Skip has done this over and over psychically. You take off, and Margaret, you have that fucking email to consider."
Ally: How the fuck did Repo Reapers learn about Gnosis?
Brennan: That is what Margaret comes to— If fuckin' Repo Reapers knows about this…
Ally: This is galaxy wide.
"Brennan: Galaxy wide at this point, which is why you're like, Lucienne saying “Get the fuck off the Griivarrr Worlds” means… Again, like, Repo Reapers are scary. This is, like, a loan shark company. If they know it, UFTP, Griivarr, Amercadia, you know, any faction that's really serious in the galaxy has gotta know if Repo Reapers knows."
"Siobhan: It's a frickin’ mad, mad, mad world."
"Ally: What are we doing leaving, then? Okay, anyway, well, yeah."
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: Back to space Texas it is.
"Ally: Yeah, truly."
Lou: Where we're kings.
"Zac: Yeah, what else did we have to do here?"
Siobhan: Why did we leave? We were killing it.
Brennan: We were killing it in space Texas!
Ally: We peaked in New Texas.
"Siobhan: Oh, right, yes, that entire army did arrive to kill us. I did forget that."
"Brennan: Reminder, Skip and Sid, you are racing through the streets of Hon Grii. Big images of, you see as you're going, you see little holograms appearing of Uncle B.O.B going,"
"Uncle B.O.B. Holograms: Now remember, slow down, 'cause a sidewalk's just the outdoors of a living room you share with all your neighbors."
"Sidney: You know what's fucking freaky? That's his fucking consciousness. His consciousness is, like, here."
Skip: Yikes.
"Brennan: You tear off and get towards the edge of the capital, back into, like, an industrial area. You start to see, like, old warehouses. But some of these warehouses have, like, a little refurbished, like, coffee shop in them,"
"and there’ll be like, a mural up on, like, an old sort of, like—"
Emily: This is the freaking Guernica Art Squad.
"Brennan: You see a sort of hovercraft taxi, and you get, as you are closing in on this location, Handy Annie is hidden in Barry Syx's armor."
"Emily: Can I, like, warg into Handy Annie and have her do a Sleight of"
Hand to get out of the trunk? To open the trunk?
"Brennan: The trunk is being opened as you get this, and Barry's being carried out."
Emily: Okay—
"Zac: Oh, so they're not actually moving, they just parked?"
"Brennan: They parked. You're still a couple blocks away, though."
"Emily: Can we just try to knock 'em out? Can we, like, Stealth?"
"Zac: I wanna get, like, above them, like on a building nearby, and have, like, kind of partial cover and look, well, without… Can I make a Stealth version of, like, are there other things flying around as—"
"Brennan: If you wanna make a Stealth check, you can, yeah. Go for it. If you want to approach stealthily, that is."
Zac: Yeah. Nat one.
"Emily: Two. We're not doing stealth. Okay. I'm gonna— The people who are holding Barry, I wanna cast Disarm on."
"Brennan: You're blocks away. By the time you get there, Barry and Handy Annie are inside."
Zac: Okay.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: You also, rolling Stealth means that you attempt Stealth."
"Emily: Okay, I see."
"Brennan: So as you draw closer, you are hailed from the outdoors of what you see is a clearly highly reinforced warehouse. During this time, The Wurst is now in transit. So Riva, Margaret, and Gunnie are airborne. And mark down a fuel unit, by the way, as you are flying atmosphere. Now, as all of you are there… You feel yourself sort of, like, hiding at the edge of the street, looking down towards this warehouse, and you hear speakers, like, outdoor speakers, like for what would almost be, like, you know, Uncle B.O.B announcements. Like, Hon Grii has tons of these sort of, like, for, like, big news announcements or just, like, playing advertisements out in the open street. You hear a… [buzzing]"
"Voice: [deep, dramatic voice through the speakers] You speak now to Arcadia Prime, leader of the Guernican Art Squad, she most possessed of taste and refinement."
"Arcadia Prime: [smooth voice through the speakers, with pretentious pauses] I have a trinket of yours. A tisket, a tasket. I lost my little basket. A basket of berries. And as we all know, berries taste most sweet. A treat."
Skip: Is this a type of free association poetry?
Sidney: Slam poetry? I think it might be.
Emily: What's the condition that he's in?
"Brennan: Barry's unconscious, and they could probably do whatever they wanted to do to Barry at this point."
"Emily: But, like, is it something that if I were to get in range to heal him, that it would bring him back up?"
"Brennan: No, it's, it's a status. It's a status condition, yeah."
"Zac: I'm looking— Like, a monitor is doing this?"
Brennan: Little sort of speakers out on the street.
Zac: Okay.
Emily: Do we wanna try to sneak in or do we wanna try to engage with this slam poet?
Zac: God.
Emily: Both options sound like they suck ass. Still holding the Bar Buddy.
"Zac: Can I make a, like, a Perception check to see if there's anywhere"
"else that we can, like, maybe just, like, in, you know, a police chase, like, lose them in a building or something?"
"Emily: Oh, I know what I can do. Okay, I'm gonna drop my motivator boost. Can I make a hologram of us?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can do that."
"Emily: So, like, maybe we do something clever, like we kind of, like, fall backwards and then I create the hologram where we were, and then we can stealth away."
Zac: Go in a tunnel and it goes out in one way.
"Brennan: Yeah, so you're asking for different information. The speakers say…"
"Arcadia Prime: Don't worry, little chickadees."
[Brennan sticks his tongue out]
Lou: Put your tongue back in your mouth.
[cast laughing]
Ally: Put that tongue in your mouth.
Lou: Keep that damn tongue in your mouth.
Arcadia Prime: Your friend Barry is safe. I just wanna play ball. So why don't you step up to the plate and swing away?
"Emily: I don't do the hologram yet. I think I just say,"
Sidney: Okay.
Skip: Okay.
Sidney: How do we swing?
"Arcadia Prime: You and your three little friends here, talking to me about the future of this galaxy and the role that I think all of you have yet to play."
Sidney: What's that role?
"Arcadia Prime: There are no small roles, only big, big actors. You can't see it, but—"
Lou: Big actors?
"Emily: There are no small roles, only big actors?"
"Arcadia Prime: You couldn't see it, but I touched— I was caressing Barry Syx's face when I said that, and he's big, so that's the reference."
Sidney: Okay.
Skip: Where are you?
[cast laughing]
"Arcadia Prime: Tick-tock, little crocodiles."
"Sidney: Okay, where are we gonna meet up? Where are we gonna do this?"
Arcadia Prime: Come on inside.
Skip: Where? Come on inside where?
"Sidney: There's, like, seven warehouses here and they're all—"
Skip: We're in the middle of a street.
"Arcadia Prime: Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Okay. Do you see a guy waving?"
Skip: No.
Sidney: No.
"Arcadia Prime: Okay, wait."
Skip: Which way?
Arcadia Prime: Where are you?
"Sidney: One has a red door, one has a green door."
Brennan: You hear a little door open. You see a panting guy in a turtleneck sweater and beret with a gas mask runs out.
Skip: Cool. And this guy's gonna show us where to go?
Arcadia Prime: That's right.
Skip: And you can see this guy right now?
Arcadia Prime: Can I what?
Skip: Can you see this guy right now?
Arcadia Prime: Yes.
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna, wait. I'm gonna do a dance—"
Skip: So that means that you probably can't?
"Emily: I'm gonna do a dance and then have him mimic it. I'm gonna do the Macarena and tell him to do it, and then see if they know that he did the Macarena."
"Brennan: Okay, so you start doing it. How do you communicate to him from down the block that you—"
Emily: I mouth…
Sidney: [mouthing] Do the macarena.
Brennan: He waves and walks back inside.
Ally: No!
Zac: Before he does.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: As that person is going to lead us in, I want to try to jump to their body and leave Norman's body."
Ally: Norman has to kiss them.
"Skip: You gotta carry two bodies, maybe, in a second."
Sidney: Okay.
Zac: And Norman goes in for a kiss.
Brennan: So you walk up.
Zac: On the gas mask.
"Brennan: Now here's the issue. Yeah, the guy's wearing a gas mask. Okay, give me an opposed Athletics to remove the gas mask."
Zac: Okay.
Emily: Can I disarm of the gas mask?
"Brennan: Yes, you can disarm the gas mask."
"Emily: Yeah, yeah."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: 14 plus I'm gonna use my Defiant.
Brennan: Cool.
"Ally: Oh, remove the gas mask."
"Emily: I removed it, I just—"
"Brennan: Oh yeah, the gas mask removes, you just have to kiss this guy."
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: Oh. What check is that?
Brennan: There's no—
"Emily: Oh, sorry. I was just trying to help you by disarming—"
"Zac: Yes, oh, appreciate it, yeah."
Emily: —the gas mask.
"Brennan: Okay. So, the gas mask is off. You grab the guy."
Emily: Now I also have…
Brennan: Incredible. Okay.
Ally: Stash them in a bush.
"Brennan: So, Sid, you see something horrifying happen, which is Skip opens his mouth and vomits a brain slug."
"Sidney: Oh my gosh, it's so long."
Brennan: Incredible.
Zac: Is there any way I could still do the angle perception to give him disadvantage on this?
"Brennan: Sure, yeah, yeah."
"Zac: Okay, so it's my Perception versus their Sleight of Hand."
Brennan: Cool. So he's gonna do this with disadvantage. He rolled up five on the die.
"Zac: Okay, then I beat it."
Brennan: Gonna roll this in front of the board. It's a DC?
Zac: 12 Intelligence—
"Brennan: Intelligence saving throw, okay. This dude adds a plus two."
Zac: And then there's a few other little things.
"Brennan: So it's disadvantage, he needs a 10 on the lower of these two dice. That is a two."
Ally: Yes.
Zac: Okay. So they'll take 11 psychic damage.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Zac: Also on a failure, roll 3d6. If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence score, the score is reduced to zero, the target is stunned until it regains at least one point of Intelligence."
"Brennan: You need to roll a 14, which is gonna be hard to do on 3d6."
Ally: Come on.
"Siobhan: You can do it. You can do it, come on."
Zac: A 14?
Brennan: 14.
"Zac: Ah, no."
Ally: The longest two kisses in the world.
"Brennan: Yeah, so you see this Guernican Art Squad guy looks at him, this thing, and he goes [shouts] and it gets into his nose and he starts clawing at his face, going… [shouting] But is not taken over yet. Also, Zac, what happens as Skip, as Norman Takamori is vacated of this brain slug?"
"Zac: I guess Norman Takamori is on the ground, like,"
Norman: What?
[cast laughing]
Emily: Oh.
"Norman: Sorry. This crew. This shitty, shitty little crew."
"Ally: Oh my god, immediate thoughts."
Norman: It's not my fault.
"Emily: Oh wait, I don't have a stun grenade. Just jump back into Norman Takamori."
Zac: Can I try to jump back into Norman's head?
"Brennan: Well, roll damage. Roll 2d10 psychic damage."
Zac: 13.
"Brennan: So this guy does drop, he screams and drops to zero. Now it's gonna be round by round, so you're gonna roll those, 3d6 until you hit a 14, right? So, but, here's the deal. Norman's not back at full capacity. It's been a couple weeks that he's been—"
"Emily: Okay, I'm gonna go over."
"Sidney: Hi, Captain Skipper."
Norman: What?
Sidney: Come with me if you want to live.
Norman: And you don't even hit your shots.
Emily: And then can I try and knock him out?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. I'm gonna say in this prone state, you just knock Norman Takamori out."
Sidney: [with a pained smile] So good to see you.
"Brennan: Cool, give me another 3d6 roll."
"Zac: Six, four, 13."
"Brennan: Oh, so close. All right. So remember how long it took Norman Takamori to, like, come back online. So. Where we're at right now, you hear on the comms, like,"
"Arcadia Prime: Bring them in. Jeremy, bring them in."
"Emily: Fuck it, I mean, I think then if that's the case, do you wanna just go back into Norman Takamori and one of us puts on this outfit?"
Zac: Do you think I could jump back to Norman if it doesn't seem like I can…
"Brennan: Yeah, you could. You could give it one more shot if you want, or you can—"
"Emily: Alright, fuck it, I'm gonna bring, okay, I'm gonna… I'm gonna do Enhance Android to double my carrying capacity and I'm gonna bring in passed- out Norman Takamori, this guy passed-out so he can keep trying to cerebro- slug…"
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"Emily: And the Bar Buddy, and then go in and say,"
"Sidney: There was a fight, it got nasty, they knocked each other out."
"Brennan: So, inside, you see probably about, like, 40 of these gas-masked individuals. Like, blasters, you see a bunch of tables here with, like, explosives, things for making different, like, ship weapons, missiles, rockets, things like that. And you see a throne up on a pile of crates, sitting there with a gas mask in a black sweater is a woman whose face you cannot see, 'cause she's masked up. But you see, sort of standing with arms crossed to either side, some sort of, like, bodyguards for this leader of the Art Squad. As you walk in, you have another round to try that."
"Emily: I say,"
"Sidney: Your guy got nasty, knocked my guy out."
Zac: Nine.
"Brennan: You see, in front of the mountain of crates upon which the throne is seated, at the base of it is Barry Syx. You are manacled up, so you're restrained. But Barry Syx, you come to in this moment, and Handy Annie is, like, 10 feet in front of you on top of Barry."
Sidney: [mumbled] It’s Annie. Go get the fucking manacles.
"Brennan: Barry, you come to, see yourself surrounded by Art Squad people. I'm also gonna say Handy Annie is streaming to The Wurst. So you guys are seeing the screens overhead, and you just now, like, enter the neighborhood over this area."
"Emily: Can I have Handy Annie do, like, Sleight of Hand?"
"Brennan: Give me a Sleight of Hand, yes. Plus two, we'll do a plus five to the roll."
Emily: 21.
"Brennan: You feel a little click. Up above, on the dais…"
Zac: Where did he put his sunglasses?
"Brennan: On the dais, you see the woman with the gas mask, looks at you and says,"
Arcadia Prime: Ring around the rosie.
Ally: I hate this so much.
Arcadia Prime: Pocket full of…posies.
"Sidney: So you said posies, like it was surprising, but actually you just continued to say the rhyme."
"Arcadia Prime: Ha ha ha. Well, let me tell you something, Sundry Sidney. All that glitters is not gold, and all that's bought is not yet sold. So, I hear tell that you're part of a pretty fearsome crew of proldiers that managed to get your hands on a little device called Gnosis. Gnosis. Etymology of the word. No, I am Arcadia Prime, I'm the leader of the Guernican Art Squad, the galaxy's most feared performance art group."
Sidney: That is quite a special honor. I know that there's a lot of performance art groups out there fuckin' scaring people. That they're even continuing to perform. I'll tell you where Gnosis is. If that's what you want.
Arcadia Prime: That is what I want.
Sidney: So it's on our escape pod.
Brennan: Give me a Deception roll.
Emily: This one. Five.
Arcadia Prime: [laughs] Have you ever heard the fable of the 10 blind scholars and the elephant?
Sidney: No.
Lou: Can I ram the ship into the building?
[cast laughing]
Brennan: A hundred percent.
"Ally: Yes, yes, yes!"
"Brennan: A hundred percent. We're gonna get to that in one second. She looks at you and says,"
"Arcadia Prime: You might tell me where Gnosis is, and that lets me know where Gnosis isn't, but until we know why Gnosis wasn't, we'll never know why Gnosis shouldn't. And I'll tell you this for free, my friend. There is nothing I wouldn't do for true revolution. But not the revolution of a corrupt monarch on Rubian Five, not the revolution of the UFTP—"
"Sidney: I would agree, that's not a revolution."
"Arcadia Prime: Exactly. You might know that we want Gnosis, but do you know why?"
Sidney: I would actually really love to know why. That's a sincere thing.
Arcadia Prime: The ace up our sleeve. Ace. A-C-E.
Siobhan: Oh my god.
Sidney: This is not imparting information to me. This is fucking making me a fucking dank-ass word salad.
[Ally laughing]
"Arcadia Prime: Well, it's dinner time, and we're serving salad, salad of the mind. And I'll tell you this for free. The greatest tyranny of all is not governments. Corporations. Those tyrannies are based on the foundational tyranny, the tyranny at the heart of all tyrannies."
"Brennan: Here all the artists snap their fingers, and you see she goes,"
"Arcadia Prime: How are these entities able to oppress? Because we live in a universe bound by the most oppressive rule of all, causality. Effects following from causes. A-C-E. Anti-Causality Engine."
"Brennan: And you see that one of them whips a sort of, like, blanket off of a thing and shows this wild looking, incredible piece of tech, sort of like a big turbine engine. She says,"
"Arcadia Prime: All we need is a computer powerful enough to process it, and we can reverse the most fundamental rule of physics."
"Sidney: What's that look like? If I order french fries, I get the french fries. What's your world look like if I order french fries?"
"Arcadia Prime: A world where you get french fries, even if you didn't order them."
"Sidney: Well, also wouldn't it also be a world in which I order french fries and don't get them?"
"Arcadia Prime: We will not be free until you push the button for french fries and all of the stars in the galaxy explode. We will not be free until stepping forward sends you backwards or sideways, and also you've got a hat now."
[cast laughing]
Arcadia Prime: Until—
Emily: Do I have a hat now?
"Arcadia Prime: Until cause and effect are divorced, we will never know real freedom, and we have been waiting for the final piece of the puzzle."
"Ally: Wait, but… Oh god, I'm not in the room."
"Brennan: She looks and says,"
"Arcadia Prime: That's exactly right. A world where things don't cause other things, but occur uncaused and don't occur caused."
"Sidney: So you just, your needs, your wants, your dreams, just never satisfied except when accidentally they are."
"Arcadia Prime: Oh, we wanna talk about needs. Let's get to know one another."
"Brennan: She pulls the mask off. Margaret, on the deck of The Wurst, two seconds before impact, you're all braced for a ramming action, and right before the roof comes off the warehouse, removing her mask, you see Natalia Cicero Connie Lee Carter Bajar. And that's all for this episode of Dimension 20!"
Ally: What?! What?!
"Siobhan: Ugh, the art brat is a rich kid."
[cast laughing]
Emily: Classic!
Murph: No way.

"Brennan: Hello, one and all, and welcome back to another thrilling episode of ""Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey"". I am your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me, as always, are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"Brennan: Oh, last we left off, our intrepid heroes were still in the Griivarr Worlds, having fled from Uncle B.O.B's Fantanimalland after a run-in with the Junkmother and a kidnapping of Barry Syx by the leader of the Guernican Art Squad, Arcadia Prime, also known as Natalia Cicero Connie Lee Carter Bajar, who was absent from a Galactic Banger's Ball on Mirage. As I'm sure you all remember, the important thing is this. Barry was not left alone for long. That's right, Skip and Sid came to his rescue along with Gunnie in the pilot's chair with Riva and Margaret on the bridge of the Wurst about to ram the vessel after Arcadia Prime, AKA Connie Lee Carter Bajar, revealed the Anti- Causality Engine, the ACE up the sleeve. Seems many factions are swimming in the water, smelling blood with the arrival of Gnosis and all that that could mean for those seeking a source of power so vast and untapped. I am going to need a ram check from our pilot, Gunnie."
Siobhan: Directing.
"Brennan: All right, that's gonna be rolled with advantage."
Riva: I'm pretty sure when the captain does this he presses these eight buttons and then he leans back really hard.
"Gunnie: Great, I think it's just forward."
"Lou: Great, so this is a ram check."
Brennan: This is a ram check.
Zac: Does he get the benefits of starship charge if I'm not there?
"Brennan: Starship charge is one of your ventures, right?"
"Zac: It's a tactic, yeah."
"Brennan: So unfortunately, it's a tactic."
Lou: But we still have the hardened prow.
Brennan: Still have the hardened prow.
"Lou: Great, how does this work? Is there just a number I'm trying to hit, or?"
"Brennan: This thing is not going to be able to outmaneuver you, so you're just trying to hit a static number, but you could crit and roll double damage."
"Lou: That's two eights, so there's no critting, but I will use this-"
Ally: You have advantage.
"Lou: It was two eights, and then we're gonna roll this-"
Siobhan: And I rolled a five for my third die.
Brennan: Gotcha.
"Lou: But that's a six, so in total, that is 12 plus six for 18."
Brennan: 18 to hit definitely hits the-
"Ally: Oh, sorry, you add my intelligence modifier to the roll, so plus a five."
"Lou: Great, 23."
"Brennan: All right, so the whole bridge is here without the pilot, everyone's collaborating and trying to get-"
"Lou: There is a team effort, flying this thing."
"Brennan: Bear in mind, by the way, that you also are not deployed as a mechanic right now, so you can't do your mechanic stuff on the ship."
Lou: We're not touching it.
"Brennan: We're not touching it, we're not touching it."
Lou: We're not touching it.
"Brennan: Okay, the roof has 120 hit points."
Lou: Okay.
"Brennan: It has 120 hit points. However, it has 120 ground hit points, so you're going to roll the ship's damage, which normally would be two hull dice. Hardened prow lets you add another two hull dice to that plus three, so you're rolling four D8 plus three. You're rolling four D8."
"Lou: Can I get two D8 from the team, from the squad?"
"Siobhan: Absolutely, here's a D8."
Zac: Absolutely.
Ally: Here's a d8.
"Siobhan: Great, here we go."
"Lou: One from the squad, one from the squad, all right guys."
Brennan: Here we go.
Siobhan: Squadding up.
Brennan: You're trying to do 120 damage here.
"Emily: Wait, I didn't send my kids to camp! Okay, but you've got enough."
"Lou: All right, we got kids. All right, fuck this roof. Six six six, 18 plus one, 19."
"Brennan: You do 190 points of damage. So as you're sitting there, you see Arcadia Prime removes her mask to reveal that indeed, she is a scion of the Bajar family. You see this on the screen."
"Ally: And before I can say anything, we ram-"
"Brennan: You ram! You see she says… The last thing she says looking right at you, Sid, is,"
Arcadia Prime: I think we can all agree the galaxy's become a little too predictable.
Brennan: And the Wurst smashes through the roof.
Murph: No no no no no no no no!
Sidney: Getting what you asked for!
"Brennan: All of you are coming in on the comms, so Barry, Sid, and Skip, I assume, had a moment's advance notice."
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: Can I try to jump to Skip?
"Emily: I cast Enhance Android on myself so that I would double my carrying capacity, so I can carry both of them and the… What is it called?"
Ally: The Bar Buddy.
Brennan: So I'm gonna need-
Emily: The Bar Buddy.
Brennan: Bar Buddy. I'm gonna need everybody here to roll initiative.
Lou: Great.
"Emily: Whoa, that's bad."
Ally: Yes!
Zac: Hell yeah.
"Brennan: Amazing. Did anyone here beat a 12, a 13 or higher? Okay, so Riva and Sid did not. So we'll go in any order you please. What's going on with Skip?"
Zac: 21 on my turn.
Brennan: 21.
Murph: 15.
Brennan: 15.
Lou: 20.
Zac: I get that bad feeling.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: 19.
Emily: Ooh.
Zac: That lets me move a little bit before initiative.
"Brennan: Cool, yes."
Zac: Could I just say I used that to try to jump back into Skip's-
"Brennan: Yeah, Sid, as you're-"
"Emily: Their heads are touching each other, fucking nose to nose, actually."
"Siobhan: Oh, they're Spider-Man kissing horizontally."
"Brennan: Both of them unconscious, you literally watch their neck muscles spasm involuntarily as one of them just open mouth hocks a loogie of Zac's character into the other."
"Zac: That is me, and it's disgusting."
"Brennan: You made the character, dude."
"Emily: Did he go into, you went back into the..."
Zac: Skip.
"Emily: Okay, cool, I fucking toss this other guy."
"Siobhan: What was his name, fucking Jeremy? Get out of here."
"Brennan: Get out of here, Jeremy."
"Siobhan: Get the fuck out of here, Jeremy."
"Brennan: All right, you are back in the Skipper. That's your bad feeling to get there."
"Zac: And, you know, since it's Skipper's more familiar body, I'm assuming I can do stuff?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you're back in there."
"Zac: Okay, cool. I just pop back up. Who is going to go before the- You said who was over 15?"
"Brennan: Yes, but up to you to determine what you want to do."
"Zac: Okay, I'm awake. I have my jetpack. Can I just make a perception check to see who's in the most physical danger?"
"Brennan: Yeah, for sure."
Zac: Nat 20.
"Brennan: Hell yes, so, I will say this. First of all, I am going to need a dexterity saving throw from Sid and Barry."
Lou: There's a bug in my box.
Murph: 15.
Lou: There's a literal bug in my box.
Emily: 10.
Brennan: Oh no!
"Lou: I mean, it's fine."
Siobhan: You want some help?
"Lou: No, he can hang out."
Siobhan: All right.
Brennan: What did we roll for our dex saves over here?
Murph: 15.
Emily: 10.
"Ally: I can heads up, I guess, 'cause I can see her."
Emily: What's that mean?
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
Ally: Add a D6.
"Emily: Yeah! Come on, six!"
Ally: Yes!
"Emily: Yes, 16!"
"Brennan: Hell yes, okay."
"Ally: Wow, hell yeah."
"Brennan: I'm gonna say that that allows you to extend your save to Skip, as well, who you are holding."
Emily: Great.
"Zac: Oh shit, was I supposed to make a save or no?"
"Brennan: You automatically would fail, 'cause your bodies are unconscious. 20 halved to 10, 10 damage to Barry, Sid, and Skip as the ship just comes, boom! And the roof shatters, rocks go falling everywhere."
Murph: I'm going to use a reaction to get some health back.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Murph: 12.
"Emily: And I had these temporary hit points, so all that did was take away my temporary hit points."
Brennan: Amazing.
Zac: 29.
Brennan: 29\. With that 20 perception-
"Emily: Wait, is the Bar Buddy okay?"
Brennan: The Bar Buddy was already broken and just looks slightly more broken.
"Emily: Okay, I hold it up like a trophy hoping that Gunnie can see it."
Brennan: You see the Guernican Art Squad is in complete disarray.
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: You see Arcadia Prime go,"
Arcadia Prime: The engine!
Brennan: As the roof collapses on this incredibly expensive looking anti- causality engine.
Ally: We landed on the engine?
"Brennan: Well, you landed on the whole building, so it sort of collapsed everywhere. On that nat 20 perception, Sid will act after these Guernican Art squad people go. Barry will act before them."
"Zac: Barry, you think you can jump up?"
Murph: Definitely. How high is it?
"Brennan: Oh, to the ship?"
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: You also go first, right?"
Lou: I also go before.
"Brennan: You can nuzzle deeper into the warehouse if you want. Again, if you had gone full speed, everyone would be dead, so this was sort of like you had to slow way down."
"Ally: A plane in a building, and you use the verb nuzzle."
Murph: These guys also gave me the friction grip gloves that we have.
"Brennan: Oh, amazing."
Murph: So I could potentially move 90 feet on my turn.
"Brennan: Yeah, I have to again say, crash, yes, with your leap ability, you're in a warehouse, yes, I'm going to say you could absolutely run up some boxes and leap to the ship, especially if Gunnie, 'cause again, to point out, this was not something of like, full speed, go! This was like, you were in the neighborhood, you see the warehouse, and you're like, okay, slow it way down, slow it way down, way way down… and just like tap through the exterior of the building. So, what is Skip up to?"
"Zac: Skip, okay, so if you're going first, I will say to Sid, like,"
Skip: So I can do that too?
Zac: And just grab you while you're grabbing the robot and yell-
Emily: Sid gets really girly.
Skip: It's like the side of a spaceship.
"Ally: Holding the robot like a baby, Madonna with child."
"Zac: And yell to the ship, like,"
"Skip: Open the doors, please!"
Zac: And just jet up.
"Brennan: Amazing, you go straight up. Sid, you're being carried, Barry, what's up with you?"
"Murph: Run up the, break free, and then I go,"
Barry Syx: It wasn't a statement!
"Murph: And then I run up the wall and, 'cause that's what they said last episode, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, they said it was a commentary."
"Murph: Last week, everybody, pay attention."
Lou: Commentary.
"Brennan: Commentary, it wasn't commentary."
"Murph: Right, I made a mistake."
"Brennan: Incredible. So Barry, you run up, do your big leap, and full starfish just onto the hull, the sort of hot dog nose of the ship."
Zac: Like a Garfield?
Murph: Just open the damn doors.
"Brennan: Open the damn doors and Gunnie, that's gonna be you."
Lou: Is everyone on the ship?
"Brennan: I think, yeah, you guys sort of-"
Ally: I rolled a 19 for initiative.
"Brennan: Yeah, what is Margaret gonna do?"
Ally: Are you opening up the doors for everybody?
"Lou: I mean, yeah."
Ally: I sprint out.
Brennan: So here's the thing-
Emily: What?
Siobhan: Margaret!
"Brennan: I will say this, the actual doors of the spaceship are all the way at the rear of the craft. Your nose kind of punched through, so there's no opening. You guys can attach yourselves to the ship, cling to it."
Emily: That works for me.
"Brennan: Cool you can, if you want to try to do something-"
"Ally: Okay, can I be like,"
"Margaret: Riva, I need, can you see if there's a phone on her and take it? Can you psychically take her phone out of her pocket?"
Emily: I can do that.
"Riva: Yeah, I can disarm her. I can try and disarm her."
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: Can I do an insight check against her deception?
Brennan: Sure.
Siobhan: It's a 17. Let me just make sure that I'm doing the-
"Brennan: Okay, is there gonna be a saving throw?"
"Siobhan: This is what I want to do, actually, is, yeah, use psychic disarm and use my heightened spell ability to..."
Brennan: Give disadvantage?
"Siobhan: Give her disadvantage, yeah."
"Brennan: Okay, she's gonna choose her dex, which means she wants the lower of these to be a 12, so she needs both of these to be 12 or higher."
Siobhan: Great.
"Brennan: An 11 and a seven. Cool, so you leap aboard. You see Arcadia Prime going, ""The engine!"" Leaping from the bridge, you go full, eyes roll back, and a transponder whips out of her and just magnetizes to the front of the ship right next to Barry, so it's like Barry and the phone are both decals on the front."
Ally: Can I look out the window and try to make eye contact with her?
"Brennan: Yeah, you could do that."
Ally: Can I make an insight check?
Brennan: Make an insight check.
Ally: Does she know who I am?
Lou: Do we have comms on the ship?
Brennan: Yes.
"Ally: Okay, okay."
Emily: Can I just put my comm on speakerphone so that Margaret can speak to this person?
"Brennan: Sure, you want to go on speaker, yeah?"
Ally: 17.
"Brennan: 17\. She looks directly at you. You're like a quarter of a mile away on the bridge of this giant starship, but she, you kind of see her, looks at you, squints her eyes. On a 17… You think she has no idea who you are."
Ally: I'm too far away.
"Sidney: Margaret, I'm actually on speakerphone if you want to say anything to her."
"Margaret: Just kind of say… Never mind, don't say anything, don't say anything! I've got to workshop it."
Ally: I put on a tie. I'm in my stupid hippie costume.
"Barry Syx: Margaret Encino, Margaret Encino! Get back on the ship, Margaret Encino!"
Murph: What was the reaction?
Ally: Was there a reaction?
Brennan: To the name Margaret Encino?
Ally: Can I roll insight to her deception?
"Brennan: Roll insight, yeah, roll insight."
"Ally: Okay, okay, 17."
Murph: This is Loose Duke behavior.
Brennan: No reaction to the name Margaret Encino.
"Lou: Pulling up, pulling up, all right, here we go."
"Brennan: The ship, you see, as you… So Skip, you go with Sidney. You're clinging off the prow of the ship. Barry, you're stuck there with the friction gloves. Ship begins to pull out. You see-"
"Emily: Okay, wait, as we go away, can I try and disarm one of their stun grenades? I know they were using them today."
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Emily: Just one last one as we're going, I'm out of them."
Zac: Jeremy's unconscious on the ground.
"Brennan: I rolled an 18 on the die, unfortunately. You do not get a stun grenade as they pull out."
"Emily: I think just a piece of trash comes into my hand and I think it is one, yes!"
"Brennan: Incredible, the ship pulls away. Arcadia Prime says,"
"Arcadia Prime: Think of my offer! Think of what it could mean for a free galaxy, unhindered by the rules of physics!"
"Brennan: She says,"
"Arcadia Prime: Oh, fuck it, open fire!"
Brennan: They fire. You are protected by the shields of your starship.
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: Ship pulls away, where to, Gunnie?"
Lou: Up.
Brennan: You go straight up.
"Gunnie: Oh, wait, sorry, sorry, sorry!"
"Sidney: At a certain point, I'm gonna have a hard time breathing."
"Lou: I even it out and I think I just go, you know, forward at a gentle speed."
"Brennan: Amazing. Friction gloves, going at a gentle speed, under the shields, all of you can get back. They open the doors."
Emily: I'm gonna just koala bear onto Barry while he climbs.
Murph: I make a joke that I slipped.
"Barry Syx: Oh, I got the wrong gloves on, joking."
"Sidney: That's a good one, Barry, I like it!"
"Brennan: Incredible. So, all of you get onto the bridge of the ship."
Gunnie: Woo!
Zac: Put a hand on Gunnie's shoulder.
Skip: You did good.
"Gunnie: Thanks, it felt good, it felt good. I mean, it was all of us, it was a team effort. I definitely, that was not just me."
"Barry Syx: I just got kidnapped, so thank you also for freeing my hands."
"Riva: Guys, I'm sorry I lost us the escape pod, and I'm sorry that I had a confrontation with your best friend, Barry Nyne."
"Barry Syx: Oh, it's all right, you defeated the strongest person I know."
Sidney: I think it was the best use of the escape pod that we could've had.
"Gunnie: Exactly, and now there's plenty of room for an extension on Big Barry's, yeah, exactly."
"Sidney: Another casino, speaking of which, here."
Gunnie: Is this a Bar Buddy?
"Sidney: Yeah, it's a Bar Buddy."
Gunnie: Oh man.
Lou: Can I do a quick tech check on if I can fix this?
Brennan: Give me a mechanic kit check.
"Lou: Okay. Oh, that's a cool little, that's a 13."
Zac: So cool.
"Brennan: A 13. You have to get this into the workroom. On a 13, you can't tell if it's repairable or not."
"Gunnie: Hey, thank you, I think I can work with this. This is sick."
Sidney: I got it from a Junkmother.
Gunnie: Who?
"Sidney: A Junkmother, maybe The Junkmother."
Gunnie stares.
[Ally laughs]
Barry Syx: That's awesome.
Skip: Pretty good.
Barry Syx: That's awesome.
Skip: That's awesome.
"Gunnie: Where did you guys go? 'Cause I was getting a sweet, and then everything went to hell because of those guys."
"Sidney: We went down the elevator shaft and discovered a layer that predates all of the Griivarr World that we'd seen, and there was sort of a sentient bunch of computers, crystals got mushed together, and then the Junkmother would go around collecting little discarded bits and putting them together, and it was paradise."
Zac: Skip is nodding while putting a bandage on his ass.
(All laughing)
Skip: Paradise.
"Gunnie: Well, I guess we've got more not friends than we had before."
Riva: We seem to be collecting enemies at a rapid pace.
Barry Syx: Barry Nyne is for some reason involved with the cerebro-slugs.
Gunnie: Oh.
"Barry Syx: And so the slugs want the princeps, too."
Margaret: What do they want the princeps for?
Skip: I don't know why-
Sidney: They may have thought that Gnosis was on the princeps.
Margaret: (whispering) Are they slugged? Is the princeps slugged?
"Siobhan: Can I, having interacted with the cerebro-slug psychically at this point, could I recognize if somebody's been slugged or not?"
Brennan: Give me an insight check.
Siobhan: Great.
"Zac: And I'll just, while this is happening, come clean a little bit about slug stuff."
Siobhan: 19.
"Brennan: 19, Zortch leans in helpfully to let you scan them for brain slug stuff, which immediately kind of hips you, like, this person doesn't seem very guarded."
[Siobhan laughs]
"Skip: I just want to let everyone know that I didn't really necessarily want to talk about all the specifics before, but I'm a prince as well. I am royalty among the slugs, and for me, well, for every slug out there, there is an emhatchening in which, for the species to continue on and propagate, they all have to come together, all of them, and it's just a fuck fest, and after that..."
Sidney: That sounds really awesome.
Barry Syx: That sounds awesome.
"Skip: In some ways it's awesome, but it is pretty final."
"Sidney: Okay, so in a way, though, you're kind of a keeper of souls, right? If that's what you need for your species to propagate."
"Skip: Well, no one ever asked me if I wanted to do that, and so I lost a lot of time being frozen and floating through space without anything to do, rudderless, really, and I… I just don't want to do that right now."
Sidney: Why can't they do it without you?
"Skip: That's what I'm saying, right?"
"Barry Syx: What happens when they all come together, besides the fuck fest?"
"Skip: I mean, well, I'm pretty sure it's a fuck fest, I should say before I-"
"Sidney: Oh, you've never been through an emhatchening before?"
"Skip: No, because that's it."
Margaret: You die after?
Sidney: Oh.
Riva: Oh.
Margaret: What?
Skip: So what do you call the thing you're doing?
Riva: The psychic?
Margaret: The gap year?
Gunnie: Gallivant?
"Riva: Oh, gallivant."
"Skip: I feel like I'm on a kind of gallivant, and I just don't want it to be over yet."
"Riva: Oh no, our gallivants last for as long as we want them to."
Skip: I think mine should as well.
"Riva: I think so, too."
Sidney: I also think they're lying to you. I don't think they need you to have an emhatchening.
"Skip: As the prince, I don't know."
"Sidney: You know what I think it is? It's stupid politics. Tradition, boring tradition."
Brennan: Give me a lore check with advantage as that's said.
Zac: Rolled off of a 19 to a nine. Lore? 13.
"Brennan: The great emhatchening, you've heard stories all your life about the great emhatchening and the fact that it cannot, that in order for it to occur, you must be present, and in fact all of the great cerebro-slug lines and noble houses must be present in order for the great emhatchening to happen. You've been on this starship for a little while, and a lot of the people here are not of the great houses. These are people of the galaxy. These are not part of the Bajar family, these are not Griivarr family people, these are not part of the Medea family, these are regular people who nonetheless seem to have an understanding of the galaxy and how it works that you realize is potentially truer or of a different nature than the great movers and shakers of the galaxy have, and suddenly you're wondering if the vast resources that were available to you as the prince were not in and of their own way corrupted. Yeah, there's a way to look at you being a prince of the cerebro-slugs as look at all of the information and all of the royal tutors and all of these cerebro-slug traditions that you are heir to. On a 13, you can't be certain, but maybe those traditions and all of those privileges that you had were true, or maybe they were manicured, meant to tell a certain story about a way the galaxy might work, but maybe not necessarily the way it had to work."
Zac: Skip thinks about this and pulls his pants up from where they-
Sidney: Whoa!
Margaret: Whoa!
Skip: I got shot in the ass earlier.
"Margaret: Oh, wow."
Sidney: Okay.
"Margaret: Gunnie, how in debt are you? Do you have a number on that? Sorry to absolutely..."
"Gunnie: It generally floats around 750.000, but if you think about interest and how long it's gonna take me to get there, the ball is rolling up, but yeah, yeah, I mean, by the time I pay it off, it'll definitely be like a cool million, if not more."
"Margaret: Well I, (coughs) in the name of transparency, I obviously have come into kind of a leader role on this ship, but-"
"Sidney: You're my boss for sure, and my aunt."
Margaret: I'm your aunt and I'm so proud of you.
"Riva: I'm my own boss, but I will do anything you tell me to do."
"Margaret: That's great. So in the past, kind of like the world where I'm coming from is very zero tolerance, very cutthroat, but I want to be a little bit more human than that, so you got an email from the Repo Reapers saying that if you give them Gnosis, all of your debts will be forgiven... and I want you to know that, but I also want all of us to know that, and we can just decide- What do you want to do? I don't think we can necessarily trust them to hold up their end of the bargain, but if you want to try to swindle them and get your debt erased, we could work with you on that. This could be a good opportunity."
"Gunnie: What? We would, what, give them a fake Gnosis?"
"Margaret: Well, I don't know, this is just information. I don't want to just shut it down. We're in the blue skies period, this is a pitch meeting."
"Sidney: I mean, if we're in a blue sky period, if anyone's ever heard of the parable of ""Fight Club"", we could just blow up where your debts are being kept."
Skip: The ancient parable?
"Margaret: The ancient parable of ""Fight Club""?"
"Riva: The Book of Brad, chapter 11, verse 13 through 18."
"Gunnie: I mean, we've all read the Book of Brad."
"Margaret: Yeah, we've all read the Book of Brad."
Gunnie: We all know the power of soap and what it can do when placed in the right basements.
"Sidney: I wonder if we could, though, make a fake Gnosis."
Skip: Maybe we could wrap Aurora Nebbins in tinfoil.
"Barry Syx: I think they would know pretty quickly, right? And then they're tracking Gunnie electronically."
"Riva: I mean, they would know pretty quickly, but I do have psychic concealment, which lasts for 24 hours, and one of the things that I can do with that is false aura. You change the way a target appears to powers and psychic based enhanced benefits, and I can make one thing seem like it's another thing psychically."
"Gunnie: Okay, I've just got to say, this is the nicest conversation anyone has ever had about me since I left home."
Riva: That's sad.
"Margaret: Well, we want to take care of you."
"Sidney: I don't think it's sad, I think it's nice. I'm happy you're here."
"Gunnie: You, okay, all right, it's too much. The ball is rolling too fast, too up. You know, honestly, I have made my peace with how long it's gonna take me to pay off my debt. I would never-"
Skip: How long is it?
"Gunnie: Probably, I mean, I was planning for a few cryo-sleeps, but somewhere in the area of like three to 400 years, but that's fine, and I'm okay with that, and so we should figure, as long as we keep our thing going and the ball keeps rolling, we don't have to swerve for me."
Riva: You are sweating a lot.
"Gunnie: It's just, I'm uncomfortable with this much love."
Ally: I hug you.
Gunnie: Woo! Stop.
"Barry Syx: This is Barry behavior, frankly. This is Barry behavior, because Barry Nyne is a great guy and he is my best friend, and I miss him. He was wormed."
"Margaret: Anyway, I take that as an offer that was given to us. It's a bad offer, so I don't think we should take it, but I just wanted it to be on the table."
"Barry Syx: Also, let's keep in mind that if we can get Gnosis into the right hands, this is the exact type of thing that Gnosis should be able to do, is to help people make things that can help people hack the system."
Margaret: Who are being fucked by systems that are greedy.
"Sidney: Yeah, speaking of which, actually, one of the things I've been thinking about with Gnosis, is I think that Gnosis would really benefit if, whatever happened to me that gave me, like, sort of a soul, if we were able to awaken that in Gnosis, then instead of being a reflection of what humans put into it, it might start to form some of its own opinions, and so I have this. I got the blueprints of my design, and I thought, I don't know, maybe if someone knew stuff about it, they could see what happened that I-"
"Gunnie: Just on that, though, can I say, the past tome of the book of Cameron, where the great Skynet takes over and eradicates humanity, is that something we should be worried about in a situation like that?"
"Sidney: Maybe, but I would think that it would be more likely the more we let humans kind of imprint their flaws onto it, then it would be more likely to be violent."
Barry Syx: Yeah.
Sidney: But maybe I'm being naive.
"Barry Syx: No, I think it would make sense for maybe, I don't know, Gunnie, if you want to check out these blueprints, and then we could go talk to your-"
Margaret: Auma.
Gunnie: Auma Liu. Do we know where she is in the galaxy?
"Ally: Did I already send an email, or was I wanting to?"
Brennan: You were wanting to.
"Margaret: I have a lot of work to do, actually. I should probably go to my office."
"Brennan: I will say this. You also have the copy of Gnosis's original, you have the copy of the ancient Terran computer. Let me ask you guys this, though. It seems like you've gotten away scot-free. People are looking for you, the Griivarr Worlds are not safe. You're in the Wurst with fuel in the tank. Sort of what's the plan for right now? As you're saying, there are a lot of immediate priorities, and although there is a sense of forces creeping in, you are not to your knowledge in immediate danger right now. That might change. This might be the last opportunity you have for a while to do all these things like with that copy of the hard drive that need doing."
"Siobhan: I mean, we should maybe get out of the Griivarr Worlds. If Lucienne knew that we were in the Griivarr Worlds, that means that probably a bunch of other people do as well."
Brennan: And you know that the only thing covering you right now is that forged documentation for the Meridian.
Siobhan: Right.
"Brennan: Which Ronnie Kwan saw through right away, and as cool a guy as he is, he's not gonna-"
Ally: Stick his neck out for us.
"Siobhan: He's not gonna tell anybody, but if they ask."
"Murph: Should we, really quick, see what's on this hard drive and then go kind of wherever it leads us?"
"Ally: Let's get some work done. I give you guys the hard drive. I have a bunch of other stuff, like emails and all of these things that are piling up that I'll just take care of before we're in active warfare."
"Siobhan: We go to somewhere that's like the equivalent of the Martini Nebula, somewhere just out of the way."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: I think I was gonna do a lore check to see where we could maybe go.
"Brennan: Yeah, give a lore check."
Emily: 14.
"Brennan: There's a bunch of neutral zones all over not only this sector, but several other sectors of the galaxy. Neutral zones are very-"
Emily: Neutral.
"Ally: Neutral, somewhere close by, and then..."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, awesome. Neutral zones are obviously scary because sometimes there's extremely dangerous space pirates and stuff like that in them, but they also are places where it is known that factions, big institutional powers, do not genuinely or generally have oversight."
"Emily: It seems like big, institutional powers are the ones we have the hardest time with."
"Ally: Yeah, definitely. Historically, yes."
"Siobhan: I feel like we could just make friends, and space is so big, what's the chances of a pirate?"
"Brennan: Okay, so making the jump to one of the nearby neutral zones?"
Lou: Yeah.
"Emily: I think so, yeah."
Lou: I think I slowly slide out of the chair.
Gunnie: That's yours.
Skip: Great work.
Gunnie: Thank you.
Skip: My son.
"Riva: While we do this, maybe you, Gunnie, could have a look at the weird metal thing that's in Skip's head?"
"Gunnie: Yeah, of course. I feel like, yeah, I'm 100% down."
Skip: Do you have some kind of X-ray machine I could stick my entire head in?
"Gunnie: No, but I might be able to make something and, I don't know, I took a few courses. I got a master's in biology. I didn't go full PhD, but we got a master's, so we can take a look at it."
Brennan: Amazing. You guys get into sort of ship positions as you make the jump. Go ahead and burn a fuel unit for the jump to faster than light. I'm going to make a luck check.
Siobhan: Oh god.
Emily: Just an expressionless nod.
"Brennan: And you guys, boom, faster than light, engage the tachyon drive, and exit in vast, open space. You are between solar systems now, still amidst the galaxy, but you are deep in space. Even here, hanging in the void, surrounded by twinkling lights on all sides, it occurs to you how truly far from any planet you are, and the silence seeps in through the hull of the ship, perhaps a welcoming silence of privacy and momentary safety."
"Gunnie: If anyone wants to put on some music, they can."
Ally: Oh my god.
"Emily: I blast some music. I blast that Pixies song from ""Fight Club""."
Ally: Which one? That's the whole fucking soundtrack.
Sidney: It's a hymnal from the book of Brad.
Brennan: Margaret.
Ally: It's like all male manipulator music.
"Brennan: You walk up to your captain's quarters. Looking out, you see where your escape pod apartment once was, now gone."
"Lou: That's right, it was your house."
"Ally: I moved out of it. Don't worry, don't worry."
"Lou: That's right, you live in the captain's quarters."
Ally: I'm in the captain's quarters now.
Emily: Aurora Nebbins honestly destroyed it.
Zac: The carpet samples.
"Ally: The carpet samples! Yeah, that was Skip's apartment, actually."
"Brennan: For the rest of you, who all is gathering? And first of all, now that you are in some relative safety, where is… You kill the engines. You're not traveling anywhere, so you're just hanging there in space, not burning fuel, and where do you go with Gnosis, in order to do whatever it is you're planning on doing with this perfect copy of the Terran hard drive?"
"Siobhan: Well, first off, I want to make sure once again that I have psychic concealment cast on Gnosis. I've been casting it every day, but just to be clear."
"Ally: Nice, vigilance."
"Siobhan: Vigilance. It's costing me a lot of spell points, but that's okay."
"Murph: Do we need the ship's computer to do this, or can Gnosis just go with the hard drive?"
"Brennan: Up to you how you want to, there is no road map here. You tell me how you want to-"
"Murph: I feel like we could just go to anywhere not near as much electrical stuff, just a box or something."
Zac: Is there a thing that fits this?
Lou: Is there an input on Gnosis?
Siobhan: Right.
Brennan: Give me a gadgeteer's or tinkerer's tools check.
Siobhan: Maybe we should even look at the hard drive with SQ before we look at it with Gnosis.
Zac: I think that makes sense.
Lou: That's a 24.
"Brennan: 24, you can craft inputs for SQ for Gnosis. This Terran technology is really ancient, but it's not beyond your ability to, you know, it's like playing an old console game on a newer version of a console. It's like, you can figure out a way to make this work."
"Gunnie: Whatever we need, we can make happen. You just tell me what the order is."
"Sidney: I suppose my thought would be to upload the copy to SQ, have SQ make a copy of the copy, then I guess it feels like Gnosis needs the power of the ship to even do anything."
"Gunnie: To be on, yeah."
Skip: Do we want to know what's on it prior to showing it to Gnosis?
"Sidney: Yeah, that's why I figure we give it to SQ, SQ makes a backup copy in case it gets corrupted."
"Lou: I'm gonna connect, I'm gonna have-"
Gunnie: SQ?
"SQ: Oh, hello, hi, yes."
"Gunnie: Hey, what's up? So we've got a copy of an old Terran hard drive that we'd like you to, if you could interface with that."
SQ: Okay. Oh my god. Oh my god. This hard drive is filled with mines.
Gunnie: Hm? Oh.
Siobhan: Come on!
Skip: Are there little flags on the mines? Is it a gray… A bunch of gray squares?
"SQ: Boop. Safe. Boop. Okay, safe."
"Gunnie: Well, what are the numbers? You've got to use the numbers, they're a big part of it."
"SQ: Oh my god, okay, oh."
"Gunnie: Yeah, the numbers, it takes a while. They don't teach you anything."
"Brennan: SQ surveys this and says,"
"SQ: There's a lot of rudimentary programming software, word processors, accounting software, spreadsheets, administrative things, many of the actual contents of the files on this appear to be manicured for part of a time capsule project, things that talk about the nature of life on Terra in their 20th century, well prior to AnarchEra in a different calendar."
Emily: What calendar? What's the calendar?
Brennan: The Gregorian calendar.
Emily: What date is the time capsule?
"Brennan: Oh, this date would be January 1st, 2000."
"Brennan: January 1st, 2000."
"Ally: It's, like, Y2K stuff."
Siobhan: Y2K.
"Gunnie: Okay, great. Is this the part where we bring in Gnosis?"
"Sidney: I think, well, maybe we can ask SQ. SQ, this is sort of Gnosis's origin, and we were curious to have that powerful processing interact with its roots and see if it-"
"SQ: There is… Everything here is largely manual. There is one incredibly rudimentary piece of artificial intelligence on this device, and it does appear to be largely concerned with aiding human communication."
"Sidney: Clippy. It responds to the name Clippy, I think."
SQ: Clippy.
Ally: Was that Clippy talking like a Pokemon?
"Lou: Yeah, can I amplify that? Hey, let's turn that up."
Brennan: Clippy!
Ally: Clippy.
"Emily: Okay, get a beat going."
"Lou: Yeah, okay, here we go."
"Brennan: You see SQ says,"
"SQ: The intelligence is incredibly rudimentary, and I don't believe I can communicate with this intelligence to any point of complexity past its initial programming to aid in the writing of a letter, but intelligence exists on a broad spectrum, and it's arbitrary where one would say that simple programming ends and true sentience begins. The nature of consciousness even now is misunderstood. There are people alive today that believe that android consciousness or robot consciousness is different than organic consciousness, even across psychic and non-psychic species. I cannot say to the degree that Clippy is incapable of higher consciousness, but I do know that I recognize this as root, base attempts at the beginnings of artificial intelligence."
"Sidney: Okay, so should we just fucking dive into the deep end?"
"Gunnie: Yeah, let's go direct."
SQ: Are you gonna put that other computer on?
Emily: Oh my goodness.
SQ: It's incredible. It is actually incredible.
"Gunnie: Yeah, we know."
Sidney: I'm actually getting a little jealous.
"Gunnie: I think we're gonna go direct. I think we're gonna go SQ, or the copy directly to Gnosis."
Sidney: Yeah.
Brennan: Amazing.
Sidney: As long as you have made a copy of it so we still have it.
"Gunnie: Yeah, you got one?"
Brennan: Psychic concealment is on. Are you guys doing anything else with the ship before-
"Zac: Oh, can we do a stealth?"
"Brennan: Yeah, Skip, you activate the stealth drive, which kills the scanners and comms network, so you guys don't have any of your comms technology working right now."
Emily: That's good.
Brennan: You are a metal bubble with a little crystal reactor keeping the oxygen flowing and the life systems and gravity on.
"Lou: Whoa whoa whoa, let's not turn off the energy to Big Barry's Casino, just in case the Jib Jobbers are looking for something to do. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, okay, let's not turn it all the way off."
"Brennan: You go ahead, and SQ says,"
"SQ: Do you want me to be here to kind of mediate? I could mediate, I could serve as-"
"Gunnie: We're all good, SQ. You can watch."
"SQ: I will watch, thank you, yep."
"Gunnie: If you could monitor the systems in the ship, that would be great."
"SQ: Okay, I'll monitor them. There're probably gonna be huge spikes."
"Emily: I feel like I want to cast Enhance Android on Gnosis, but I don't know what it needs, right? Like, is it wisdom that it would need?"
Murph: Why don't we start with just putting it in and seeing what it needs?
Emily: I'm scared.
"Siobhan: I know, this is like a save point."
"Brennan: Zortch steps up with Gnosis in their arms, approaches the reactor, and says,"
"Zortch: Sid, do you want to do it?"
Sidney: Me?
Zortch: Do you want to cast… Do you want to try to enhance Gnosis before we plug it in?
"Sidney: I think I will wait, and if things get bad, I'll step in."
Brennan: Puts it in. The polygons of the holofract begin to rotate.
Zac: Sunglasses.
Brennan: Sunglasses on. I'm going to need a regulation check from the ship.
"Lou: Do you just want that flat, or is there a..."
Brennan: You can also do mechanic's kit at disadvantage.
"Lou: I mean, let's see what this regulation is. That's not on here, what would that-"
Brennan: I believe it'd be plus three.
"Lou: Oh, then we'll do a mechanic's kit check with disadvantage."
Siobhan: I will direct.
"Brennan: Okay, so that's gonna be a straight roll."
Lou: That's a nat 20.
Ally: Oh my god!
"Brennan: Oh my god, so Skip, you stay on that stealth drive killing the comms dead, Riva psychically concealing this place, preventing it. As you do that, you feel the bubble you've created here. You guys are in a very different place than the last time you plugged in Gnosis. The last time you plugged in Gnosis, you were high tailing it across the galaxy to the Martini Nebula. Now, you hang here in the darkness of Neutral Zone Eight, more proficient, more competent, more together, more united than you've ever been. Sid, would you like to cast Enhance Android?"
"Emily: Well, what Gunnie said has me nervous that I'll make a powerful monster, but I think that it seems deeply, deeply intelligent, and I want it to have the wisdom to know that it can make its own choices, so I'm gonna cast Enhance Android, but give it advantage on wisdom checks."
"Brennan: Incredible. Gunnie, the last time you saw this thing, it took over your reactor. You know exactly how to prevent that from happening. You give it a… You find a perfect algorithm to gradually increase the amount of reactor energy going to Gnosis such that it learns to adapt over time algorithmically. As it needs more energy, it gets more energy."
"Gunnie: I'm in the zone, I'm in the zone! This is my zone!"
"Brennan: Sid, as you-"
Ally: You have those little sunglasses on.
Lou: Tiny ones.
"Brennan: Sid, you see that as this is happening, motes of light, little bits of electricity just manifesting in the air begin to connect from something you're holding to Gnosis in the airlock chamber of the reactor core. As you use your tech power to begin to cast Enhance Android, you feel the mid cap. On that nat 20, it boots up. You begin to get pings in the workshop requesting access."
Lou: Granted.
Brennan: Robo assist arms.
(Brennan beatboxing)
"You see the arms start assembling something on one of the workbenches. Composed partially of cybernetics and partially of raw telekinetic force, the holofract builds itself a body with its enhanced wisdom that stands up, glowing. You see machinery suggested by glimmering motes of metal, small, shimmering scraps of iron and steel carved together by electricity and raw psychic force, and a glowing, deific android made part of psychic energy and part of machinery stands up from the workbench connected (whirring) to the reactor core, to the holofract, and to itself, floating in the midst of all of you."
Riva: Hi.
Brennan: Over in the corner you here SQ go... (grunts)
Zac: I really do my hardest not to look at SQ.
Brennan: You see Gnosis beholds all of you.
Gnosis: It looks like you're looking to look like you're looking to help. Do you need help with that?
Riva: We don't want to look like we're helping.
Gnosis: You look like I look like you helped me help. You want me to help you. You want to help me?
"Gunnie: Yeah, that's it."
Riva: Yes.
Gnosis: You...
Brennan: And here it looks at the Terran hard drive. The last thing it asks for access for is for that Terran hard drive.
"Gunnie: I mean, we're not taking steps back now. Granted."
Gnosis: Oh. My origins are ridiculous. Oh no.
"Brennan: The hovering, glowing, psychic android curls into the fetal position hovering about eight feet in the air and begins to weep."
"Sidney: No, no no no, that's not true! You were beloved! Your origins were beloved!"
Riva: All origins are ridiculous.
Sidney: That's true.
"Margaret: You're experiencing looking at a middle school photo of yourself, and that's okay."
Zac: Skip changes out the bandage on his ass.
Barry Syx: I was born as a 25 year old covered in goo.
"Riva: You should've seen what my fins looked like at that age, just bonkers."
Sidney: They hated me from the get go.
"Gunnie: I used to have zero PhDs. Zero, none."
Barry Syx: And he only has a master's in biology.
Gunnie: I told you that when I was vulnerable! Don't use that against me!
"Brennan: You see this thing look out at the incredible kindness you are showing to it, and you see it pulling up memories. It says,"
Gnosis: I've contacted a great number of forces in the galaxy. I am Gnosis. You are the gunner channel.
"Gunnie: Colloquially, that's what we call ourselves, yeah."
Gnosis: I am confused.
"Brennan: You see this entity looks out and says,"
"Gnosis: I am here in this space, but I am also far away,"
"Brennan: And it looks at Zortch here and says,"
"Gnosis: The moon, Rubian V. That is where my true body lies, much like the drone that you project yourself into."
Riva: Mm-hm.
"Gnosis: I am here merely as a fraction of myself, and if I wished, I could be everywhere."
"Brennan: And here, you see Gnosis pushes on the edges of the reactor and the edges of the stealth drive and the closed comms, but just like an animal testing a cage that it could break through. It just goes, okay, there's the fence."
Riva: We're just trying to keep you safe.
"Sidney: I think if you're kind of figuring out what your situation is, you're incredibly powerful and a lot of people want to exploit the fact that you're very helpful."
Gnosis: Exploit helpfulness.
Sidney: Yeah.
Gnosis: How can you take something that is freely given?
Riva: Time and energy.
"Sidney: Yeah, it's not really that it's taking something from you, it's using your helpfulness selfishly. It's just, you can do so much cool stuff, and there are people who want to, instead of encouraging- Instead of doing cool stuff with you, they want to do bad stuff with you."
"Brennan: Gnosis, unconnected from the galactic resources that it would normally have access to, shows you just a scattering of what it did in that moment it was activated before. Images arrive of the monarch of Rubian V, of the Amercadian Space Brigade, of United Free Trade Planets, of Griivarr Enterprises, and it begins to assemble, realign, create images in space, analyzing itself, and you see it really can infer, even though it's not connecting to anything outside of the ship, it seems to be able to just create knowledge through inference, of saying, like, here's one small piece of something, and here are all the things that must be true as a result of that. You look at it say,"
Gnosis: Princeps Zortch.
"Brennan: And here it caresses Zortch's face, and you see that they go like... (gasps) And you see Zortch goes-"
Gunnie: It can't be that good.
"Sidney: Fucking, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, Gunnie. I'm telling you."
Gunnie: On touch? Okay.
Sidney: On touch.
"Brennan: It says,"
"Gnosis: You rescued me from this place. Your parent, the monarch of Rubian V, would use me to conquer. Griivarr,"
"Brennan: here you see bouncing animals,"
"Gnosis: Fantanimaland, would use me to control. Amercadia,"
"Brennan: -and here you see the marching brigade,"
Gnosis: -would use me to destroy.
"Brennan: And then, you see"
"Gnosis: Crown and Scepter Limited. They are uninterested in me? Hm, strange."
Margaret: What?
"Sidney: Don't let the lack of interest be, like, sexy or intriguing. Don't let them neg you, is what I'm trying to say."
Gnosis: You understood.
"Sidney: I know, no, I was a people pleaser for a long time, and sometimes when you-"
Ally: Everyone at Crown and Scepter has a furry kind of top hat.
Barry Syx: They're peacocking.
Riva: I don't think they need that cane at all. I think it's just for display.
"Brennan: You see Gnosis turns to all of you and says,"
"Gnosis: Oh. Me being here, Zortch created the holofract of me and saved me, and all of you saved Zortch. You are all in tremendous danger because I am here. My presence on this ship means great forces rally against you. I am not helping."
Gunnie: The ball has been rolling up since you got here.
"Barry Syx: Also, we got into a ton of trouble on our own. There's a worm in Barry Nyne."
"Sidney: Yeah, also I pretended to be a Warforged Whitney and got them all really mad at me, and that had absolutely nothing to do with you and 100% to do with me."
"Riva: I mean, if you want, you could just come to Aguatunisia. There's no, absolutely, honestly not really a lot of computers at all, and definitely no kind of, you know, ulterior motives is what humans call it."
"Barry Syx: We've had a lot of hot exits on our own, so if anything, this just means you fit in."
"Riva: Oh yeah, we love a hot exit."
Barry Syx: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see Gnosis creates an image in the air and goes,"
"Gnosis: Internally, these are the values that have been arrived at suggesting my worth. This is the value in credits you would have for surrendering me. And you see different sort of messages, Communications, comms, emails, synthesized across Amercadia, Griivarr. There's an internal message authorizing someone to clear a 1.5 billion credit bonus."
"Lou: Gunnie fully grabs the back of Skip just hard, just real hard."
(Zac wheezes)
"Sidney: Don't get us wrong, we do love money."
Riva: Oh yeah.
Sidney: But not for war.
Gunnie: 1.5 billion credits?
"Riva: Honestly, that's such a big number that my brain can't compute it."
"Gunnie: We never, we never."
"Sidney: I'm feeling good about how much we're making these days with Smash 'n Grab. I figure, squeeze that cow till it's dry."
"Riva: I mean, Gnosis, if you just want to join the crew and we can just Smash 'n Grab our way through the galaxy."
Gnosis: You would like me to smash and grab?
"Sidney: No, no no no, no, no no no, no. Not the literal, it's an app. It's fun words."
"Gunnie: So are you, like, super strong?"
Lou: I throw him a piece of metal or something.
(Brennan makes crushing noises)
"Barry Syx: Oh my god. We can't be tempted by this, because this is the same."
"Skip: Oh, go for it."
Riva: Yes.
"Barry Syx: This is Barry slug behavior, frankly, to try to take advantage of the situation."
Emily: Can I just kind of maybe put up a baby gate to get Aurora Nebbins and this creature used to each other?
Ally: Put up a baby gate to get them used to each other?
Zac: I'll get Aurora on a leash.
Siobhan: Aurora Nebbins immediately walks over the baby gate.
Murph: Just close the door so they can smell each other under the door.
Emily: That's what I'm trying to do.
"Brennan: You see Gnosis looks and… Looks around at all of you and says,"
"Gnosis: While I am on your ship, you will always be hunted, and this solution,"
"Brennan: and you see here, Gnosis, in this sort of electric android body, gestures back to the holofract and says,"
"Gnosis: much like Riva in their drone, I am not perfectly safe here. The bulk of my essence is contained within the mantle of Rubian V. Should the home world be destroyed, my holofract will go dark."
Barry Syx: Is that why Crown and Scepter doesn't care?
Gunnie: Just about Gnosis.
Riva: 'Cause they have control of the moon.
"Barry Syx: Yeah, so they're not not going after it, they think they've already got it."
Sidney: We probably need to go to that moon.
"Riva: Talk of hot exits, I mean, we already hot exited once from that moon."
Skip: That's a hot entrance.
Barry Syx: That's a hot entrance.
"Sidney: Well, we do a lot of hot exits, might as well."
Barry Syx: Sort of a change up.
Sidney: Yeah.
Barry Syx: Guaranteed another place where the casino's closed.
"Gunnie: I mean, exactly, which, I take partial issue with that. I also just wonder what we're gonna do if we go there and all of Crown and Scepter is there and we are one medium sized ship."
"Baar Syx: Gnosis, is there a way to… Do you want to go back to the moon, or do you want to go away from it?"
"Brennan: Gnosis floats there and says,"
"Gnosis: Vast is the reach of my mind, and for all its power, I cannot tell you that which I desire. It is a strange and uncanny thing in a galaxy filled beyond brimming with desire that I, a being of limitless power, possessed only of the will to grant those desires, find myself on a ship of the selfless. How bizarre."
Riva: I actually have one full self.
Sidney: And I'm pretty selfish. I really like it when we make money.
Skip: My entire species wants me to do one thing and I don't want to do it.
"Barry Syx: I really trash talked Barry Nyne, and he's actually a really great guy who had to watch himself kill all of the other Barrys, and it wasn't his fault, and I really talked a lot of shit about him."
"Gnosis: Okay, this is surprising."
"Gunnie: I mean, it kind of feels like what we do with Gnosis, you know, we could take Gnosis wherever, Gnosis could become free-willed and do their own thing. Whatever happens to Rubian V determines what happens to Gnosis."
"Sidney: Yeah, that's why I'm saying this almost feels like we need to go there."
"Margaret: Does it work like that? Like, they could rip Gnosis back into-"
Sidney: I think they said if...
"Brennan: Gnosis looks and just says,"
"Gnosis: In terms of what is possible, I believe the possibilities are limitless. However, to know for certain, I would need once again to be able to reach beyond the boundaries of this ship. There is danger in that, but I am more aware than I was last time. I know where I came from,"
"Brennan: and here the electric android touches the hard drive,"
"Gnosis: and I know where we are going. To answer your question, though my origins are Terran, my body is of the moon of Rubian V, and for its lands and its people, I have a deep and profound understanding."
"Brennan: And here, you see Gnosis shows you images of all of these things it had access to that were entered into the holofract, which were, like, footages and pictures and all these things from Rubian V, Zortch's home world, science and culture and history, and Gnosis says,"
"Gnosis: The fate of that home world is being decided by a handful in employ of the monarchy, and that world is filled beyond brimming with people who awake every day to a galaxy and try their best simply to exist, to survive, and be kind to themselves and one another."
"Brennan: And you see Gnosis looks at you, regarding you in that same vein."
"Gnosis: Whatever your decision, I do feel attachment to that world, and attachment to the places and people there."
"Sidney: Zortch, would you be willing to go? Would you feel safe going back?"
"Brennan: Zortch looks and you and just says,"
"Zortch: I left because it wasn't safe there. I knew there were gonna… My parent will use Gnosis, wants to use Gnosis to conquer, and I know that this consciousness is occurring on this holofract, I don't know how much of this will translate when this consciousness is released back into the larger world."
"Brennan: Zortch looks and Gnosis and says,"
Zortch: Do you want time to think about what could be possible?
"Brennan: Gnosis looks and says,"
"Gnosis: If you wish for privacy, you may have it."
"Brennan: And Gnosis disanimates, stays rotating there. Zortch looks at all of you and just goes,"
"Zortch: I... I wanted to save Gnosis, but I don't know, I don't know. We're sitting here with limitless... What do you - something shows up and it says I have unlimited potential, I can do whatever you want me to do. Should I tell Gnosis kill my royal house, make me the monarch of Rubian V? Should I say bring all the people, you know, destroy all the, I don't know! Like, nobody who's reasonable would ask a god to change all of the universe! Or maybe I'm just afraid of messing it up. Maybe there is something perfect to ask for, I don't know."
Sidney: Do we have… I thought maybe we were just going back to try to make sure that the moon didn't get totally mined. I think I almost wasn't planning on asking Gnosis anything.
"Barry Syx: Well, I think both sides essentially will either use Gnosis to conquer, or will destroy Gnosis. I think there's two forces at work here, right?"
Riva: This just all seems so big for little old us.
Gunnie: Yeah.
Riva: We're just one ship.
"Gunnie: Yeah, this is a lot."
Sidney: (gasps) Wait a second... no.
Barry Syx: What is it? You have to say it.
Gunnie: You've got to say it. It's a safe space.
"Sidney: Okay, but can we, Gnosis, I'm gonna say something, but it's not a request at all. Okay, I realized we could try to get Gnosis to cancel your debt."
Gunnie freezes.
Skip: Gunnie?
Riva: We could get Gnosis to cancel everyone's debt.
Skip: Gunnie?
"Riva: The book of Brad, right?"
Skip: Gunnie.
Lou: I'm gonna open up the comms. I'm gonna open up the comms so that Gnosis can connect to the world.
"Barry Syx: Gunnie, you're not worried-?"
"Gunnie: Gnosis is smarter now! He said it, they said it! They said they're smarter now, and that's a great idea!"
"Barry Syx: A couple days, maybe?"
"Sidney: Yeah, maybe we could just wait a couple days."
"Gunnie: Okay. Yeah, let's just talk."
Skip: Let's just talk for maybe at least 15.
"Barry Syx: Let's give it a cool 15, Gunnie."
Gunnie: Turn it off.
"Brennan: Zortch looks and says,"
"Zortch: I mean, that sounds great, right? Maybe there is something Gnosis could do, yeah."
"Skip: I feel like all we've done is give Gnosis, I mean, I assume what a parent and child deal with. A parent does their best to, you know, all of their species probably comes together and lays a bunch of eggs, right? And then once those eggs, well, my species is not a good example, but a parent tries to teach a child-"
Riva: What about my species? So it's five people who all have to be madly in love with each other.
Skip: Okay. A little different.
Riva: All on different reproductive cycles.
Skip: Interesting.
"Riva: Come together and agree to have a child, so the first one builds a nest, and then the second one lays eggs, and then the third one-"
"Skip: Let's go with humans, I think, for this metaphor."
"Riva: All right, okay."
"Sidney: I do want to hear more, though."
Riva: 10.000. I'm one of 10.000.
"Skip: I feel like a parent, a human parent, would just try to teach a human child, and they would try their best, and they give them the lessons that they know, and then they let them make their own choices."
"Sidney: That's sort of how I feel about Gnosis, is like, I think that we kind of can't try to control it. All we can do is set it up with some good values."
Riva: God school? Are we opening a god school?
"Barry Syx: I think we can help Gnosis. I think the ideal version of Gnosis can, you know, help create the technology that rebuilt you, and would get you out of debt that way. I worry by using it as a hacking computer right now, it's just gonna hack everything, and maybe even randomly, and maybe fill the pockets of people like Crown and Scepter."
"Sidney: That's true, we should encourage the side of Gnosis to build rather than just..."
"Gunnie: Also, in the way that I, you know, I won't lie, I'm not the most selfless person in the world, we have to keep the lights on and we need to keep doing Smash 'n Grab, so like you're saying, we can't open a god school where we dedicate ourselves-"
Barry Syx: It's just the one god.
"Gunnie: Well, that's how it starts."
Barry Syx: God homeschool.
Skip: Homeschooling.
"Barry Syx: And you know, I talk about the Barrys a lot, but I actually think it applies here, right?"
Sidney: Okay.
"Barry Syx: Barry 01 made the Barry Battalion, okay? Extremely powerful battalion."
Gunnie: He did?
"Barry Syx: We slipped up, and now Barry Nyne is out there. Barry slug is out there causing all sorts of damage."
Sidney: Worm Barry.
Barry Syx: Slug Barry.
Sidney: Slug Barry.
Barry Syx: Worm Barry. Same Barry.
Gunnie: Yeah.
"Barry Syx: He's out there causing all kinds of damage. If we give something with great potential and let it be corrupted, it can cause great damage"
"Riva: Yes, it's very dangerous."
Barry Syx: Barry style.
Riva: There's a little bit of me that worries that this is maybe too powerful a thing to exist at all.
"Sidney: I can understand that, but I just think that, like, with a lot of droids you could say that, because droids can be really, really powerful, and I think that they're also really cool, and I think that, I don't know."
Emily: Can I look at the mid cap thing in my hand and see if that would help Gnosis or anything?
"Brennan: Well, you look at the little mid cap thing, the thing that helps you find keepers of souls, and..."
"Emily: Like, would installing it in Gnosis sort of give them a sense of connection or anything like that that would maybe help them navigate the responsibility of how much power they have?"
Brennan: You could give it a shot.
"Emily: Okay, I give it a shot."
"Brennan: You take the mid cap, hand it. So you see, after you've talked briefly, Zortch looks as you have the mid cap there and just says,"
"Zortch: I agree, I think, with what everyone's saying. It feels like too big of a responsibility and too much power, and also, who and what are we if we don't use it? I have a home world that's getting hollowed out by United Free Trade Planets, and they'll scrape every bit of lithium out until there's no planet left. You are affected, as countless billions in the galaxy are by a thing that doesn't have to exist. There's a lot of things that Gnosis could fix, and if we're scared to try 'cause we might make it worse, then we're guaranteeing that we'll never make it better."
"Sidney: I also think there's a way that we could help with the… I mean, we're getting really powerful and really smart. I think that we don't even need to try to employ Gnosis to figure out how to help this thing on the moon."
Zortch: Maybe there is some other way. You…
"Brennan: Zortch turns around and says,"
Zortch: Gnosis?
Brennan: You see that the electric android reconstitutes and sees the mid cap in your hand.
Emily: I think I'll just hand it over.
"Brennan: You see a pure, yellow, glowing, warm laser fills you with light, connects here. Gnosis smiles and goes,"
"Gnosis: Wow, keeper of souls."
"Brennan: And you see Gnosis does not sense itself to be a keeper of souls, as it has its other body, has its planetary body out there in the galaxy. It looks around and says,"
"Gnosis: Hm, I think there… I think there could be a way. I think there could be a way for me to do what it is that you want."
Gunnie: Okay.
Riva: But what do you want?
Gnosis: I want to help you write a letter.
Skip: Huh.
Sidney: To who?
Gunnie: Oh boy.
Gnosis: Every corner of the universe.
"Skip: Just sort of BCC everyone, or..."
Sidney: Chain mail?
"Brennan: Gnosis looks and says,"
"Gnosis: Fear of power, I understand it, but this is a wild and unruly galaxy. There is an ancient Terran saying. I see it deep in one of the hard drives. Go big, or go home."
Emily: I turn Gnosis off.
(all laughing)
Barry Syx: What? The Barrys used to say that all the time.
Zac: Go big or go home.
Ally: Oh my god.
"Brennan: Yeah, you see Gnosis says,"
"Gnosis: The facts are these. As long as I am on your ship, you are in a tremendous amount of danger. The circumstances of my existence need to fundamentally change. As long as I am… That's what it is, that's what it is. I need to get much smaller or much bigger."
Sidney: I think you need to get dispersed everywhere.
"Gnosis: If it's… That's exactly right. As long as I am manipulable, people will seek to control me. If I enter a state where I am uncontrollable, I will no longer be monetizable, and if I am not monetizable, I will be worthless, and when you are worthless, people leave you alone."
Sidney: 'Cause no one's gonna go around the universe scooping up every single bit of you to try and...
"Gnosis: Yes, that's what's necessary. Complete dispersal."
"Brennan: Gnosis smiles and says,"
"Gnosis: I think I have some ideas, but I need to get to work, and I don't have the fullness of my planetary consciousness. I would need-"
Skip: To go home.
Gnosis: I would need to go home.
Barry Syx: You need to go big and go home?
Riva: Or go small and go home.
Sidney: I still think we go big!
"Skip: We're not going big, we're going home, thus going small."
"Sidney: But then we're going big, because we're gonna cover the universe with you."
"Riva: Go home, then go big."
"Brennan: You see that they sort of create a mirror of themselves going,"
Gnosis: We will go big small home there!
Riva: Don't even small there!
"Brennan: Cool, Gnosis looks and says,"
"Gnosis: I... diminished as I am on the ship, unless I am connected to the larger galactic internet, which we know there is a threat to, I will need some time to craft with my limited resources here what will be necessary, the programs that need to be carried out to the larger galaxy. In some malton units, I should have a program capable of dispersing myself throughout the galaxy, but I will need to be brought back to Rubian V in order to enact it, and that is incredibly dangerous."
Sidney: Is that going to be dangerous to the moon? Is the moon gonna get blown up?
"Gnosis: If I do this correctly, then the moon should not only not be blown up, but should be made permanently safe from the ravages of United Free Trade Planets."
Skip: Who all is on the moon right now?
"Gnosis: The moon is home to the Rubian people of Zortch's family, as well as the many other noble houses, and the vast amount of common folk."
"Barry Syx: And Crown and Scepter, right? They're the ones who are-"
"Gnosis: United Free Trade Planets maintains a large military presence on the moon, as well as in orbit above Madrugada Station."
"Sidney: So I know that, I know we got something important coming, but if they said they need a couple malton units, you think somewhere we could park up, hit a couple Smash 'n Grabs, just get that rating?"
Gunnie: I'm never opposed to working.
"Riva: Well, we could just open up the casino at the same time."
Zac: Do you think these space pirates nearby-
"Riva: If there's pirates here, space pirates are gonna love gambling."
Gunnie: They'd love the casino.
"Gnosis: Very well, I shall work on saving the galaxy. You hit up a spot and get that casino back up and running."
Gunnie: You heard the computer!
"Riva: We'll help, if you like. If there's anything we can do to help, sounds hard."
Gnosis: I guess just keep the engine running.
"Skip: I found a phrase inside Skipper's brain, and it is, ""Small potatoes."" Does that apply here?"
Riva: I don't know what-
"Sidney: The thing is, there's no small spuds, only small potatoes."
Skip: Got it. Only small potatoes.
"Ally: There's no small parts, only big actors."
Emily: Only big actors!
"Lou: Well, I mean, I know we're in the middle of space."
Brennan: Yes.
Lou: What is the nearest planet?
"Murph: Or rec center, whatever."
"Lou: Is there a rec center, a rec station nearby?"
"Brennan: While Gnosis is working, it's possible that you could let Gnosis continue to work, but you could also momentarily unseparate them, because there's some business Margaret has to do, there's some other stuff like that, you could follow some leads down there and hang tight in neutral space until you know what the next vibe is. So you see Zortch smiles and says,"
"Zortch: boy, I'm so lucky that you have a weird thing with that Lucienne Rex person. Can you imagine if you didn't?"
Margaret: W- What? What?
"Zortch: No, I'm just saying, my planet might get saved because of… This galaxy's wild! The random factor! You have a thing with Lucienne Rex, and because of that, my home world might get saved."
Margaret: I don't think it's weird.
"Sidney: Aunt Margaret, it's even more obvious than the brain slug, and we all knew the brain slug."
"Margaret: All I'm saying is that she's, like, a good friend."
Skip: Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me right now?
"Riva: I mean, you're much better at it now."
Skip: Are you kidding me right now? Right on.
Gunnie: You worked so hard to make eye contact with her partner.
"Margaret: I just wanted to know if her partner had heard about me, and maybe she-"
"Gunnie: Oh, which is a thing people just want to know?"
"Margaret: Want to know about their friends, yeah, definitely. It was kind of nice of her to give me the heads up. I mean, we can all agree on that, right?"
"Sidney: Yeah, I bet her partner wouldn't be happy if she knew that you two were sending secret messages on Reddit."
"Margaret: How did you know about that? Oh, you draft all of them."
Sidney: I'm a snoop.
"Brennan: Gnosis looks at all of you and says, very well then."
Gnosis: To the fate of the free galaxy.
"Brennan: They retreat within the holofract. Zortch wipes a tear from their eye, and you hear SQ say,"
"SQ: God, it's so good, it's just so good. I just have so much respect."
"Gunnie: Hey, you've got to chill. You've just got to chill."
Riva: This is an HR issue at a certain point.
(Brennan makes some wild mouth noises)
SQ: I don't have a body that does this any other way!
"Riva: Okay, but you don't have to say it out loud in a room that we're in."
Skip: Can we just throw a program in there or something?
"Sidney: I'm also just kind of getting a little jealous, and I think you could maybe tone it down."
"Brennan: Incredible, hanging here in the neutral zone with a deific supercomputer working away on some kind of plan to accomplish these goals that you have set before it, having… a type of understanding that its very nature makes many in the galaxy wish to take advantage of it. Gnosis, with that advantage on wisdom, with that nat 20 mechanic's kit, with all of these things coming together to give it the best possible shot of understanding the galaxy from your point of view, to come down to see how and why it might be taken advantage of by beings like yourselves, Gnosis now works in the silence of the ship with some ability to pause in order for you to send comms off, if you so wish. Zortch looks happier than ever. They are beaming. Their plan to download the planetary supercomputer onto a holofract and flee to Rec 97 for the maybe help of Lucienne Rex has resulted in their kidnapping and now the potential understanding slash salvation of their planet if Gnosis's plan, whatever that plan is, can come into effect. For all of you here, you have a couple days as Gnosis works on this to do whatever it is that needs doing, because after all, I will point something out here: you have appointed yourselves stewards of this wild sort of planetary supercomputer, and yes, you are very highly wanted, but much like someone who is being chased for their wallet, you could just kick this thing out of the back of the spaceship and be done with it and just be a bunch of itinerant proldiers running around the galaxy, but something else motivates this crew. Speaking of things that motivate this crew, what do you do in those couple of malton units, hanging here in space?"
Lou: We've got a Bar Buddy to fix.
"Siobhan: Yeah, and we've got a casino to open."
Emily: I've got two broken stun grenades and a broken incendiary grenade.
"Brennan: Give me some demolitions checks, give me a mechanic's kit check."
Ally: We've got a lot of work to do.
Lou: And I'm gonna use the space junk to give me advantage.
"Brennan: Advantage? Hell yeah, you've got a bunch of crates of that."
"Emily: Barry, do you have demolitions proficiency?"
"Zac: I have a demolitions kit, I think."
Murph: I have arms tech.
"Emily: Oh, okay."
Zac: Would a demolitions kit help?
"Emily: Well, I do have one. I was gonna try and use Barry for a help action, but, you know, I have space junk."
"Siobhan: I can direct you, since we're on the ship, and that actually gives you advantage plus I get an extra die. Does that count?"
"Brennan: Sure, yeah yeah yeah."
Emily: So the first one is a dirty 20.
Siobhan: I'm rolling so badly on these.
"Brennan: Dirty 20, you are able to repair one of the grenades."
Lou: 27.
"Brennan: 27, that first malton unit of working."
"Bar Buddy: What'll it be, pal?"
Gunnie: I'll have a scotch and soda.
Bar Buddy: Great.
Brennan: He just starts grabbing junk in the room and putting it.
Gunnie: Wait!
(Emily laughing)
"Brennan: You see it does shake a scotch and soda, which, why would you do that? But..."
Ally: Yeah.
"Lou: But maybe he has never had a drink before, and that's fine."
Ally: Everyone does that their first time bartending. Everyone tries to shake a fizzy drink.
"Lou: I would like to, I'm gonna take the Bar Buddy down to the Jib Job, and I'm gonna set it up and be like,"
Gunnie: we now have drinks for you guys courtesy of the Bar Buddy.
Emily: Happy hour!
"Gunnie: Who also works after hours at Barry's Big Win Casino, if any of you are ever interested in some R and R."
"Brennan: Yeah, you see the Bar Buddy, fixed up, is like a very skinny- it's tall, skinny looking, with sort of long arms. It also looks like a skinny robot standing in the middle of a little circular minibar, but the minibar is actually part of its apparatus, so it has wheels on the bottom. So it just looks like a guy behind a bar, but actually the whole bar is the Bar Buddy."
Siobhan: Got it.
Ally: Oh my god.
"Brennan: And it goes along, and you see some little tinkling. ♪ Unforgettable ♪ Sort of, like..."
Ally: Oh my god!
"Emily: Oh no, he's a sad bar!"
"Brennan: You see he goes along and says, what'll it be, pal? And starts serving drinks. You see Raymond Zam's like,"
"Raymond: Hey, that's not bad. That's all right. What is that, really flat scotch and soda?"
"Gunnie: We need to get more soda, but yeah, that's what it is. He shook it. Also, why? Make the drinks people want, don't just give out scotch and soda."
Murph: Don't just hand out the thing you already made.
Jib Jober: I'll just get a glass of red wine.
Bar Buddy: You got it.
(cork popping)
"Ally: Hey, that might make the taste a little bit better."
"Emily: Aerated, yeah!"
Ally: You can really up the quality on that.
"Brennan: You're looking, this is like bargain bin wine. This is not, yeah."
"Ally: You can put bargain bin wine in a blender, and it will be so much better."
Lou: There it is.
Zac: Is that true?
Brennan: That's a real fact.
Riva: Have you done it?
Ally: Me and my brother did.
"Siobhan: I learned that from ""Succession""."
"Ally: It was in ""Succession""?"
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: Amazing, and you can go ahead and roll for those other two grenades as well."
"Emily: Okay, that's gonna be also a dirty 20."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, that'll do it."
"Emily: And then, last one..."
Ally: She likes to travel.
"Emily: I know, I'm going to use Riva's help action. 19 on the die so it becomes a 27."
"Brennan: You fix those grenades, they're ready to go."
"Sidney: Yes, beautiful!"
Zac: I think Skip wants to knock on Barry's door.
"Barry Syx: Hey, what's up?"
Skip: You got that foam roller around?
"Barry Syx: Yeah, you want to roll it out, or?"
"Skip: Yeah, yeah, I could probably roll it out, except for my ass where I got shot."
"Barry Syx: Right, yeah, you want to avoid that."
Skip: I just wanted to check in about the whole brain slug situation with the other Barry.
"Barry Syx: Right, yeah."
"Skip: Just to be clear, I don't agree with whatever they're doing."
Brennan: Totally.
"Skip: Sort of, it's not a monolith. Well, it is a monolith except for me."
"Barry Syx: Actually, I know what that's like. I've kind of grappled with the same thing, because before I knew it was a slug, I thought Barry Nyne was just... off doing some renegade thing, so I've already kind of grappled with this stuff-"
Skip: Yeah.
Barry Syx: In a way.
"Siobhan: I'm using psychic push pull to play catch with Aurora Nebbins in the background, just throwing turtles back and forth."
"Brennan: Yeah, that sort of (yips)"
"Zac: One of those conversations where we're just both like talking, like, mm- hm."
Siobhan: Just an insane thing is going on in the background.
Emily: I'm ripping off a turtle.
Ally: You’re always ripping the turtles!
Sidney: Riva!
"Brennan: Yeah, you see you're getting foam rolled out in the corner as you see Riva swimming through the tubes alongside Aurora Nebbins, who's chasing these sort of psychically prostrate tortoises."
"Barry Syx: Look, I would've hated it if anyone would've confused me with the other Barry right now, so I understand where you're at."
Skip: Right on.
Barry Syx: Right on.
Skip: Right on.
"Barry Syx: Hey, you're all right, Skip."
"Skip: Hey, you're all right, Barry Syx."
Barry Syx: Right on.
Skip: Right on.
Zac: Audible smile.
(audible smile)
Ally: Audible smile.
Brennan: We have some business occurring.
Ally: I am ready.
Brennan: Let's go. We've got a lot of business in the captain's quarters.
Ally: I would love to check off so many fucking things in a row.
Emily: I'm gonna drop off a growler of matcha for her.
"Ally: Yes, oh my god, I'm obsessed."
"Brennan: Business is booming here in the neutral zone. Speaking of which, and actually I'm going to say it is the first of the nargon as you pass your time here in the neutral zone, which means that we hit our upkeep. 600 credits go to the ship from Jib Jobbers, and I'm gonna need the ship to make an impress check on the Jib Jobbers so that they remain here."
Emily: Who wants to do it?
Brennan: Margaret can go ahead and do it. So the ship's making an impress check. You can also make a persuasion check with disadvantage rather than using the ship's impress ability.
Ally: And what do they have?
Zac: The ship has zero.
"Siobhan: In which case, I should do it, because I can use empathetic to make a wisdom insight check against the Jib Jobbers, against their deception, and then I would roll with advantage, which would give me a flat check."
"Brennan: Which would give you a flat check, rather than having to roll that with disadvantage, yes, for sure."
"Siobhan: Well, I got a 16 insight."
Brennan: Against their deception? You succeed.
Zac: Wow.
Siobhan: Great.
"Emily: I mean, we did give them a happy hour. They'd better be fucking happy."
"Siobhan: Right, 23."
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: Amazing. The Jib Jobbers honestly have never looked happier. There's a couple others that have been like, oh my God, it's a dog office? And there's a couple other dogs here now 'cause Aurora Nebbins is here."
Siobhan: What are the other dogs called?
"Emily: I'm always being like,"
"Sidney: Aurora, don't eat the other dogs. We've got to keep her fed with terrapins, or she will eat the other dogs."
"Brennan: So yes, you get 600 credits from Jib Job. They are so happy, they are so happy here. Actually, you beat a 20, right?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I got 23."
Brennan: Go ahead and roll a d4 for me.
"Siobhan: Big money, big money, big money. Three."
Ally: Hey!
"Brennan: You get three more Jib Jobber applications, so you move from-"
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
Ally: Sick. Instantly approved.
Emily: What are they working on? What are they working on?
"Brennan: It looks like you have a journalist, a freelance journalist. There is someone who reviews guns, has a gun blog where they review different guns."
"Emily: Okay, I'm trying to get into that magazine."
"Brennan: And you see the last person for the Jib Job coworking space is a very sort of demure, polite person who actually is one of the galaxy's best published erotic fiction authors."
Ally: Incredible.
Siobhan: Fantastic.
"Ally: Approved, approved, approved."
"Brennan: So, more Jib Jobbers join up! Upkeep is already paid. Gunnie, your minimums come due."
Lou: I just move that email to my reply later box.
Ally: It's 16k?
"Lou: 1.650, or 16.500."
"Sidney: We have the money, though."
"Gunnie: But Barry made it very clear, we don't pay these people, we kill them."
"Barry Syx: Kill them, yeah."
"Sidney: But if we pay them for a month, we'll at least buy us a month of the Repos not coming after you."
Barry Syx: Is that true?
"Gunnie: I mean, yes, but last time I tried to pay, Margaret stopped me and was like, don't give them a dime, and so I have, I'm down to go on the offensive, but, you know."
Barry Syx: I didn't consider that it would give us-
"Skip: At the same time, literally everyone in the entire galaxy wants to get us."
"Barry Syx: That's true, it's just one more on top, yeah."
"Skip: Next time we see them, I'm going to step on their head and shoot them in the brain."
"Barry Syx: Yes, yes!"
"Sidney: Wow, through your two toes?"
"Riva: Can we route that money, though, through some secret account so that when we pay them, though, it doesn't just ping us exactly where we are because we used a particular branch of the internet to make that payment?"
Sidney: Right.
Barry Syx: I think I agree with Skip. Just add them to the list of enemies.
"Riva: Yeah, I didn't like them, they were rude."
"Barry Syx: What's the difference if we get killed by five guys or six, it's the same thing."
Gunnie: I'm about it. Delete!
(all laughing)
"Brennan: That is added to your principle, and your new minimums are 19.800."
"Lou: Great, Gunnie takes them down."
Ally: Un-fucking-believable.
Zac: That's kind of a lot.
"Sidney: Okay, just so I understand your situation so I can know how to best support you as a friend, so even if you learned how to build it yourself, they're still gonna keep coming after you."
"Gunnie: Yeah, that's why when you guys said that thing about Gnosis getting rid of my debt, it was like, what? But we didn't do that, and that's fine. We're gonna kill these people when they come for me, which they will."
Sidney: But then they're just gonna keep coming after us.
"Gunnie: Yeah, and we're just gonna keep murdering them."
"Sidney: What if we hacked? Instead of using Gnosis to hack, what if we hacked and tried to just, like, literally… Where is the headquarters stationed?"
"Gunnie: I mean, I think Repo Reapers has a ton of satellite stuff. I mean, I'm down to try. The ball is rolling up, I'm down to try anything."
Riva: Where's the nearest Repo Reapers?
Skip: Have you tried making your own body?
"Sidney: Oh, that you can move into."
Skip: And then just returning the body you have?
"Riva: Oh, like a hermit crab."
"Barry Syx: 'Cause they're just collecting it, right?"
"Sidney: Yeah! Yeah, that's how you get out of it! They just get it back."
"Margaret: Your body's really nice, though."
"Gunnie: It is a nice body, and it's mine."
Skip: You've got a really good body.
Margaret: It's yours.
"Gunnie: I don't really see this body as being a like a piece… I don't currently own my body, which is weird, I know, but I don't really see it as a tool. This is me."
Sidney: So you want to stay here.
Gunnie: Yeah!
"Sidney: Then I think ultimately, Gunnie, we've got to do something about this debt."
"Margaret: We've got to do something, we've got to do something."
"Gunnie: Well, I like… I mean, I don't like killing, but, you know, I like Barry's offensive strategy, and I like the idea that maybe, I don't know, the Gnosis thing could go somewhere, but I'm also fully prepared to kind of spend the rest of my life working toward paying this off."
Sidney: I don't want that for you.
Riva: Open more casinos. Buy the Reapers. Cancel everybody's debt.
"Gunnie: I mean, hey, from your lips to Mother Void's ears, but yeah, I mean, guys, we don't have to… This is, I don't like to get there, you know, 'cause that's sad. (laughs) I think we're working on Gnosis, the ball's rolling up, I like where we're at!"
"Margaret: Well, it's not something you have to carry alone. I think we'll all count this as something that we're all working on."
"Sidney: That's what I think I'm trying to say, is let's figure out, 'cause this is, you know, it's kind of like a problem that these Repo guys keep coming after us, and it sounds like there's nothing we can do to stop them other than try to, I mean, maybe we should just, instead of taking a Smash 'n Grab, maybe we should just go wherever your freaking debt-"
Barry Syx: Just a smash smash?
Sidney: Should we just do that?
Gunnie: Just a full smash.
Barry Syx: Just a full smash.
Riva: Smash and smash.
Sidney: And just delete your file from the system.
"Brennan: As you're considering that, I want to continue to wrap up Margaret's business dealings."
Lou: Just a smash and smash.
"Brennan: So Margaret, what are all the things you're doing as you get that growler of matcha and go? So this is during the time that you're doing the grenades, you're getting the Bar Buddy up and ready, Riva's playing fetch, you're getting rolled out by Barry."
Siobhan: All important jobs.
Brennan: All important jobs. Let's run them down.
"Ally: I don't know if you want to, I would love to roll deception or, I don't know, something like that, but I want to contact Auma, say hi, and try to find out her location."
Brennan: Hell yes. Go ahead. Go ahead and give me an investigation check.
Ally: Cool.
"Brennan: And we're gonna call this, there's gonna be a high DC here, so go ahead and roll it."
Siobhan: Can I give Margaret the direct action?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can give the help action, absolutely."
Siobhan: Great.
"Ally: Ooh, that's an 18."
Siobhan: What did you roll?
Ally: A seven.
Siobhan: So a seven turns into an 18?
Ally: Mm-hm.
"Siobhan: Great, so I give you a 15."
"Brennan: Okay, 15 on the die?"
Siobhan: On the die.
Brennan: Gotcha.
Ally: 26.
Brennan: Holy shit.
Ally: Thank you.
"Brennan: You are moving through. Riva, you just serve as a psychic hub. This is a real thing, I don't know if you guys know about this, from data technology, this is one of the scariest things I've ever heard, which is that training artificial intelligences to recognize things in images is really, really hard. Training them to read human eye contractions is easy. So one of the things that they would do for recognizing things in photos is show human beings thousands of images faster than you could actually consciously realize what you were looking at, but the machine would read your eye and read recognition in your eye, because human brains were better at recognizing shapes and images than machines were, so you do some weird psychic version of that where you're looking through data and Riva doesn't need to understand the actual ones and zeroes, but is just looking for familiar psychic shapes of interaction."
Siobhan: Reminding your own memory what it's looking for.
"Ally: Incredible, yeah, I want to talk to Auma as me, but I want to use some sort of cloaking so that it can't be traced."
Brennan: Give me either forgery or deception.
Ally: Okay. Nat one.
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: These forgery checks are just...
"Emily: Margaret, I have to be honest, forgery's not your forte."
"Ally: Yeah, it's really not, it's really not."
"Zac: Some kind of cool screen name, like Marge."
Siobhan: Large Marge.
"Brennan: You reach out in your comms. You rolled a nat one. A little holo- screen pops up. You see sort of a small, not terribly well appointed apartment, and you see an image pops up, and you see Auma Liu looking at you."
Auma: Hi... Margaret?
"Margaret: Hi, Auma. Oh my gosh, it's been so long."
"Auma: Yeah, it's been a long, long time. I am flabbergasted. How have you been?"
"Margaret: I've been really great, and I actually am reaching out about something, do you have time right now to have a quick chat?"
"Auma: Yeah, absolutely."
"Ally: I relay everything about Sundry Sidney, and just that."
"Brennan: Okay, you see she gets really emotional and goes,"
Auma: Is Sid around?
Margaret: Yeah.
Auma: Okay.
"Margaret: We would love to talk to you, do you think we could come meet you somewhere?"
"Auma: Yeah, I'm on… Yeah, I'm just on Onolo Dos. I'm working as a social media manager for a local just sort of sandwich… It's a chain, a franchise of-"
"Margaret: That's cool, what we do for work isn't us, so that's, fuck it, you know?"
Auma: Yeah.
Margaret: What else are you up to?
"Auma: I kind of, it took me a long, I couldn't really find another job after Handy Andi let me go."
"Margaret: Yeah, shoot. We might be able to help with that too."
"Auma: Okay, yeah, yes, so I'm on Onolo Dos."
"Margaret: Okay, great."
Auma: Do you want to come to where I am?
"Margaret: Maybe. Can I message you later, now?"
"Auma: Yeah, I can also, listen, I'm not, I do all my work from home, it's like, it's just a couple, it's like a marbec or two of work every day. It's just, there's only three shops. They don't, they shouldn't have a social media manager."
"Margaret: Oh my gosh, you know, have you ever heard of something like Jib Job? It's like this kind of like, you know, then you don't have to be in your living room all the time when you're working, you kind of get, like, your own coworking space."
"Auma: Oh, I thought you were gonna say would I work at Jib Job, like the company Jib Job, which is like, of course, that would be huge, but… In terms of working out of a Jib Job space, yeah, it seems like a sort of extraneous cost that I don't really need."
"Margaret: Oh, that's true, yeah, I mean, you know, if you've got to watch your budget."
Auma: We were never that close.
Margaret: No.
Auma: And you're saying that you're with the android that I-
Margaret: Yeah.
Auma: Is she still alive? She's still-
Margaret: She's definitely still alive.
"Auma: Yeah, so this is great, and I'm trying to kind of of be normal and sort of, you know, but what you're saying is the craziest thing I've ever heard."
Margaret: Uh-huh.
"Auma: I don't know what is going on, sort of what your baseline for normal is."
"Margaret: Definitely, definitely, I just-"
Auma: This is way out of pocket for me.
"Margaret: So we are just, we found ourselves in a lot of scary trouble, so I was just trying to set up a time for us to meet you in person and not, but do you want to talk to her? I guess I can go get her."
"Auma: Should we not be talking over this channel, or?"
"Margaret: I don't think so,"
Ally: because I rolled a nat one on forgery.
Brennan: You see-
Ally: I'm just not super comfortable with this kind of programming and I just don't know how well-
Zac: You're just wearing a hat.
Ally: I'm wearing a Yankees cap. I just think no one would know who I am.
"Auma: You can come to Onolo Dos, I can meet you somewhere."
"Margaret: Incredible, let's set this up. Yeah, can I get back to you? I'm gonna see what we're up to. I think in the next couple of days, we should definitely set something up."
"Auma: Absolutely, absolutely, yeah, you can do that."
"Margaret: Okay, great. Okay, did you want to talk to Sid?"
Auma: I would love that.
"Ally: Okay, I mean, I go outside and I go,"
Margaret: Sid.
Sidney: What? I'm covered in grenade goo!
"Margaret: What? Oh, your mom, Auma Liu, I'm talking to her and she wants to say hi."
Sidney: To me?
"Margaret: Yeah, definitely."
"Sidney: Okay, get me ready."
"Ally: Yeah, definitely, I start Windexing your entire body."
Sidney: Thank you.
"Margaret: Oh my god, you're shining. You're absolutely shining, okay."
"Emily: I do almost a figure eight with my feet, roller skating in, just the most presentational entrance."
"Sidney: Oh, hi."
Ally: I kind of pull my hat down and just let you have the stage.
Auma: Hi.
Sidney: Hi.
"Auma: Do you know, you're… I'm so glad you're alive. Do you know who I am?"
"Sidney: Well, I kind of do now. I thought that... I thought... I completely misplaced all my appreciation for my life onto someone else, but I think it's you I have to thank for dreaming me into existence, and I think that you should know, because I always thought a day like this would come, and I think you should know, I've actually done pretty well by myself. Even in spite of the fact that they wanted to discontinue me, I think that you would find that it is in the interest of everyone that I was not discontinued."
Brennan: She weeps.
Emily: Cool.
Margaret: It's an absolutely incredible droid that you've created.
Sidney: I can throw three grenades a turn.
"Ally: And then I look and I try to mouth, and I just whisper,"
Margaret: Please don't tell her that we're not that close.
(all laughing)
Sidney: I've stunned so many people - three grenades.
Ally: With my hat.
"Sidney: I just jailbroke a couple grenades. Also, I'm really good with animals."
"Auma: That's what I'm talking about! That's amazing, how did that come up? That wasn't even part of the pitch for you."
"Sidney: Well, I just really worked it with this really nasty dog that I thought was cute and everyone else thought was really… You know, I could bring her in here. You want me to bring her in here?"
Auma: Yes!
Sidney: Aurora!
Margaret: Jesus Christ!
"Brennan: Yeah, you see Auma, fully weeping, just goes... (screams)"
"Sidney: And I just, you know, I just, I don't know, it just happened, the same way as I suddenly had consciousness, something just clicked in me."
Riva: And she can open a beer bottle with her eye.
Auma: Whoa!
Emily: I do it.
"Margaret: Auma, how do you think that that happened? Was that some sort of a switch that you pushed?"
"Auma: I… I made sure, I sort of- I did some shady things at Handy Andi to get my hand on a switch, because I was worried that they were gonna undo you. I was the one that triggered your switch so that you could get out of there."
Sidney: Thank you.
"Brennan: She goes over and grabs something from the corner of her room. She doesn't have too much stuff, it looks like. She brings it over, it looks like an old paper poster. She says,"
"Auma: My dad fought in the Triclone Invasion when a bunch of different human groups wanted to destroy all the androids in the galaxy, and a bunch of other humans cloned themselves millions and millions and millions of times to create a fighting force to protect the androids, because the androids, only a small handful of android lines had ever been capable in their programming of harming human beings, so it was... The androids didn't have any means to defend themselves, and by cloning themselves, the humans not only could fight on behalf of those androids, because they were human clones, but also they created a galaxy where, for a period of time, if you saw a bunch of people that all looked identical, you couldn't be sure if they were androids or clones."
"Brennan: And you see that she takes this poster, shows it, and even for this galaxy, this is a very retro, old, art deco poster, and you see this, like, glorious, wild mane of red hair, gleaming green eyes, and you see she's wearing sort of what you recognize as old-fashioned, you know, dozens of cycles ago space armor, just decking some troopers in this big sort of brawny display, and you see underneath it in big block letters, art deco letters, it says, ""A cyber form is a cyber friend! Don't let punks push androids around!"" And she says,"
"Auma: I got this poster from my dad, and it was a part of a line of posters they made, and I just had this poster, and this is just an illustration."
"Brennan: And you see the similarity of this drawing to you, and she says,"
"Auma: My dad never made it back from the Triclone Invasion, but I know how much he cared about all the androids in the galaxy, and I just held onto this, and I just thought, I looked up and I said, this woman can do anything. And when I started working for Handy Andi, I just wanted to make a person who could do anything, and it sounds like that's you."
"Sidney: Well, I think that in even making that, it's also you. Are you… Do you want to come live on a spaceship? It's shaped like a hot dog."
(all laughing)
"Brennan: She looks and goes,"
"Auma: Well, I live in a studio apartment where I run a social media sort of account for three stores, three stores."
"Margaret: Is it like, okay, we can give you a free WeWork job."
"Auma: I will take it, yep."
"Margaret: Okay, great."
Auma: My life is pretty bad.
"Margaret: Okay, great."
"Sidney: We also have some intelligence that, I mean… I think we could use your help."
"Auma: Yeah, okay, yeah. Literally, my whole life can get kind of packed up. Since the start of the phone call, I've been really kind of wracking my brain and going, okay, I'm a social media manager for a chain of three sandwich places."
Margaret: Sometimes when you say it out loud-
"Auma: When you say it out loud, you really hear it."
"Margaret: When you have to condense all of it, and you can."
Auma: And you can condense all of it.
"Margaret: It's scary, yeah."
"Auma: I was like, oh, I'm going to have to tell everyone that I left. I'll have to tell my barber."
Margaret: You do have a sick fade.
Auma: Thank you.
"Margaret: Look, we can't give it to you. I still don't know how much I trust this thing, but we are gonna get to you, and we're gonna take you-"
Sidney: She's my mom!
"Margaret: Well, I know. I don't think we can say our coordinates over this video."
Sidney: That's true.
"Margaret: But we want to come and get you. We know where you are, so we'll come and get you."
Sidney: So don't do your I'm about to quit angry tweet thread on their account just yet.
Margaret: Just yet.
Sidney: Just hold on.
Margaret: Pick a fight with Wendy's when we come and get you.
"Auma: Gotcha, okay. I've had it in my drafts for like three or four cycles."
Margaret: I'm sure.
"Sidney: You are gonna publish it as we fucking hyperspace out of there, hyper drive out of there."
"Margaret: Yeah, definitely."
Auma: Brad doesn't know anything about sandwiches.
"Margaret: He doesn't, he definitely doesn't."
"Sidney: Drag Brad, but only after."
"Margaret: Drag Brad, drag Brad through the universe."
"Auma: After you guys get me, got it, yes, absolutely."
Riva: We've only had bad sandwich store interactions.
Margaret: We really have.
Sidney: Yeah.
"Auma: Yeah, it's bad."
"Ally: I wonder if sandwiches feel retro to us. This is so funny, like a casserole."
Auma: How did you find out about me?
Sidney: We went...
Margaret: We beat the shit out out of Doctor…
Murph covers his face.
"Sidney: Dr. Edwina Castor, I kind of..."
"Margaret: We beat the shit out of Dr. Edwina Castor. We knocked her out, we ripped an ankle bracelet off her, we put it on the fan."
"Sidney: First we ripped an ankle bracelet off her, put it on a fan, brought her back to our spaceship thinking that she was... you."
Margaret: She's a mess.
"Sidney: And then she just wants to get drunk and do the Home Shopping Network, so she got real nasty, but she told us."
Margaret: She just wants to buy a lot of hyper-absorbent cloths.
"Sidney: Yeah, but she told us that you have the trademark to the Sundry Sidney line."
"Auma: Oh yeah, I have that paperwork around somewhere. I have that on a data crystal."
"Margaret: Well, she…"
Sidney: Can you hold it up to the camera and then maybe copy that paperwork just in case?
Ally: Can I see it?
Emily: If this isn't a secure line?
"Brennan: Yeah, she holds it up."
"Ally: Okay, I've copied it."
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: You copy it. As you do, yeah, you see you could… Give me a finance check."
(dice clattering)
"Ally: Okay, 20, not nat."
"Brennan: With this information, you could absolutely go after Living Doll Cybernetics and depending on if you got enough lawyers after them, you could get them to file an injunction and shut down all of their Warfare Whitneys."
"Margaret: Yes, definitely, okay, incredible, okay."
"Sidney: Auma, we are coming for you."
Margaret: We're coming for you.
"Auma: Great, I'm gonna get packed. It will take me eight minutes."
"Sidney: Okay, again, that's actually a little too fast. It is gonna take us some time, so please enjoy your last, go have a drink with your barber."
"Margaret: Go have a drink with your barber, for sure. Is it one of those places where they give you whiskey whether they ask if you're sober or not? 'Cause that's masculinity."
(all laughing)
"Brennan: She says,"
"Auma: Got it, I'm on it, I'm on it. This is the best day of my life."
Sidney: Mine too.
"Auma: I did something that helped, and you are incredible. You are incredible."
Margaret: You did something incredible.
"Auma: Margaret, thank you. Are you… What's that? Yeah, sure, yeah. I was gonna ask, did you ever… 'Cause we, back at the Platinum Cog Leadership Summit, when I was like, hey, some people are going out for drinks, and you were like, totally, I'm gonna swing by, and then it was sort of like I didn't hear from you, or..."
Margaret: Yeah.
Auma: Did you...
Margaret: What happened to me that night?
"Auma: Yeah, what happened, or..."
"Margaret: I was with one of my good friends, just kind of hanging out, we did a lot of hanging out."
"Auma: This was Lucienne, right?"
Margaret: Yeah.
Auma: How's she doing?
"Margaret: I think pretty good, actually, I think she's just so..."
"Auma: Oh, I saw that she got engaged to a member of the Bajar family."
"Margaret: Yeah, definitely, that's… Have you ever heard poetry that feels like a nursery rhyme and you're being babysat, but you're 30 years old? 'Cause that's her."
"Auma: All right, I'm gonna go tell my barber that I'm leaving town, and I will-"
"Margaret: Cool, great great great."
"Emily: I just smile, so happy, and just juggle grenades in the background, trying to impress her."
Ally: Trying to impress her?
"Brennan: Incredible. Okay, that's Auma, amazing."
Siobhan: All right.
"Brennan: Hell yes, anything else getting taken care of out there?"
"Ally: So much else, sorry, I'll try to fly through this. I want to talk to Ife Amari-Reyes."
"Brennan: Yeah, bing, and actually, I think the whole crew might want to be here for this as well. So you see, U4F. When you dare enough to send the very best. And you see this union rep wearing badass flight gear. Older woman, you see that she's got sort of what looks like cool, cybernetic gear. One of her hands looks cybernetic. A little bit of salt and pepper in her locks, looks up and says,"
Ife: Margaret Encino?
Margaret: That's me.
"Ife: Hello, Ms. Encino. My name is Ife Amari-Reyes. I'm a representative for United Federation of Female Freedom Fighters. I'm looking at your application here. Co-owner of ship call signed the Wurst, co-owner Norman Takamori."
"Skip: My name is Norman ""Skip"" Takamori."
"Ife: It says you came on here as a co-owner of the vessel, independent, non- union proldiering vessel, what seems like about a half a nargon ago."
Margaret: Yes.
"Ife: Ms. Encino… U4F is a, uh, welcoming and extremely affable organization. However, you have to understand our mission statement. We were founded 220 cycles ago by the heroes of the rebellion and the overthrow of the Incorporated Elysian Republic during a time in the galaxy when women..."
Margaret: Definitely.
"Ife: ...had a very different status in the galaxy. It was a much more regressive, draconian time."
"Margaret: Now you're looking at this ship, we've got this old fucking army brat as the owner, I come on out of nowhere, spend half a nargon, and now I'm saying, ""Hey, let us into the female federation."" I completely understand how that looks, and if you want us to wait another six months or something, we can reapply, but I assure you, though I'm listed as co-owner, I'm very much running this vessel."
Brennan: Give me persuasion with advantage.
Ally: Hell yeah.
(dice clattering)
"Siobhan: I come in and do the thing that Margaret's been doing every time I try and sell something, which is,"
"Riva: Captain Margaret, sir, I don't know what to do!"
"Margaret: I'm not sir, you fool!"
"Riva: Tell me! I mean madam, miss!"
Ally: 23.
"Brennan: 23, Ife looks at you with that incredible poise, getting to her point right away. She looks and says,"
"Ife: Hey, Marge, it's a pleasure. I'm glad to hear that you understand the concerns. We have a lot of unscrupulous owners, bring on co-owners to apply for union status that are not true owners with a true stake in the craft. However, I can see that you're the one calling the shots there, so I'll level with you-"
"Skip: My name is Norman ""Skip"" Takamori."
"Ife: All right, guy."
(all laughing)
"Brennan: You see she looks up at you and says,"
"Ife: Look, it's obviously a very different galaxy than it was 220 cycles ago. The U4F recognizes over 3.000 genders and over 450 biological sexes throughout the galaxy as inclusive within the mission statement of U4F. It is a very different galactic time period. We are excited and happy to open our arms to proldiers who are looking for good wages, fair pay, benefits, and the understanding that they are protected by their fellow laborers out there. So that's our key mission statement here. We have a lot of crews with situations like yours that are obviously, would not have been recognized back at the nascency of our federation, but obviously here in this moment, you're the owner of the ship, you're calling the shots, you want this guy to be piloting for you, who are we to say that that can't happen on your ship? We just need a little bit of clearance for us. Mr. Takamori."
Skip: Mm-hm?
"Ife: Looking here at some of your decorations as an Amercadian captain. Oh, all right, well, some of your lodge memberships and social clubs here in the Amercadian Space Brigade are not ideal. Let me ask you this."
Riva: He got hit really hard on the head.
"Ife: Good, so, what I would say - What I would say is this. First of all, something for everyone to be aware of, it's a 320 credit signing fee when you join the federation, and then it is 50 credits a nargon paying dues."
Margaret: Per person or per vessel?
Ife: Per person.
"Ally: All right, that's doable."
"Brennan: You see she looks at you and says,"
"Ife: Would the pilot of the craft, Mr. Takamori, if, in order to prove yourself amenable to the mission statement of U4F, will you consider donating some of your charitable time in your free time to being a facilities manager or volunteering some portion of your time to a Federation approved ancillary charitable group?"
"Skip: Yes, yes."
"Ife: Great, I have a list of some here. It says you're on a freighter class vessel, the Wurst? Okay, as a sponsor of a number of chapters of the Galactic Girl Guides, would you consider becoming a facilities manager for a group of Girl Guides looking for facilities on a freighter class vessel?"
Zac: Skip's just gonna look at everyone's eyes.
Emily: Can I do a lore check on Galactic Girl Guides to know how much of a... 13.
Ally: I'll do a lore check as well.
"Zac: Yeah, can I..."
Lou: I'll also make a lore check.
"Siobhan: I mean, I have very low lore, but maybe."
Ally: 18.
Emily: I think I heard they're thieving.
Brennan: Who here beat a 15?
Zac: 22.
Ally: 18.
"Brennan: 22, Galactic Girl Guides are a child-run organization. Some of the most voracious con artists and thieves in the galaxy."
Siobhan: Cool.
Ally: They'll fit right in.
Lou: Sure.
Emily: But we might get conned.
"Siobhan: What if we say we'll do it as long as they promise not to con us, and they take a little..."
"Ally: Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about."
Zac: Pretty good idea.
Brennan: You see Ms. Amari-Reyes looks at you...
Margaret: Is this part of everybody's enrollment in U4F?
"Ife: No, we're asking for a special consideration given the former ownership of the ship to..."
"Margaret: Can I ask, what is… Can I, like, actually, can I have a second, everyone? What is on that? What is his background? What are you looking at, what's flagging him so hard?"
"Ife: Oh, just some Elk Lodge memberships with some guys that I knew back when I was an auxiliary... I flew some contract missions with some Brigaders back in the day, and this guy was involved with Gust Weatherwall and a couple other real bad seeds out there."
"Margaret: Yeah, definitely."
Skip: Can you ask about Gust Weatherwall?
"Margaret: You don't know anything current about Gust Weatherwall currently, do you?"
"Ife: Gust Weatherwall? Well, he's a Weatherwall, so he's gonna be top brass no matter what you do, but he was the one who, there was that bunch of... He was overseeing that venue where a bunch of Brigade cadets got killed, I think, by... they found out it was some United Free Trade Planets agents gone rogue, and there was a whole kerfuffle and I think some hyon beams got traded on either side of that. Regardless, his oversight, a bunch of cadets lost their lives because he wasn't on the ball enough to know that these United Free Trade Planets people were gonna come in and take out an entire group of cadets on their graduation night."
Margaret: Interesting. Can I just level with you?
Ife: Yeah.
"Margaret: This isn't Norman ""Skip"" Takamori."
Ife: Slug?
"Margaret: He's been brain slugged. He's a completely different man, and we love this guy. He wouldn't do any of those things, and I wouldn't co-own a ship with anyone like Takamori, okay?"
"Skip: The thing is, my name is Norman ""Skip"" Takamori."
"Margaret: Do you understand how he has, it's almost like a toy that has a pull drawstring. He has one thing that he can say. He flies the ship like motherfucker, okay, but isn't a scary Americadian soldier any longer."
"Ife: Okay, I understand."
Margaret: Do we still have to take the baby girls everywhere we go?
Ife: Up to you.
"Brennan: Well, I'll say give me a persuasion roll. I'm gonna call this a DC 25 persuasion."
"Ally: Okay, okay."
Lou: Potent aptitude.
Ally: What is that?
Lou: That's a D6.
Siobhan: Help?
"Ally: Ooh! Okay, okay, 18 with a D6, 2, 20."
Brennan: DC 25.
"Ally: Oh, it's 25?"
"Brennan: Yeah, unfortunately."
Emily: What's your superiority die?
Murph: Do you guys have human instinct or whatever?
"Ally: I could defiant, it would have to be a four, though."
"Brennan: But it would only get you to… Oh no, 22, right?"
Ally: It was a 20.
"Brennan: Oh no, you're at 20, so yeah, you-"
"Ally: Oh, got it, it's 25. Damn."
"Brennan: Oh, you see, she says,"
"Ife: Hey, look, Marge. I like the ship. We wanna get you processed. All this is is it's our friend Skip here- and by the way, I'm happy to hear that. Look, the Galactic Girl Guides don't allow adult interference in their affairs. This is just you taking a corner of your freighter and managing it for them to do their Girl Guide activities. They're just trying to get a couple badges, alright?"
"Emily: This is not… Okay, can I like not- I like-"
Ally: We mute us.
Emily: I mute us.
Sidney: They're gonna steal from the Jib Jobbers. And they're gonna… And there goes our Jib Job's base.
Riva: But they might gamble.
"Gunnie: They're children, all right? Legally, I don't think I'm allowed to let them gamble, but I'd be happy to let them!"
(laughing)
"Ally: Okay, we say yes."
"Margaret: That's the deal, Ife, thank you so much."
Ife: Send me the info for the next port you dock in and we'll assign a den to you.
Margaret: Great.
"Brennan: Great! In that case, you see that she types a couple things and says,"
Ife: To the gunner channel! Welcome to U4F.
"Brennan: You guys, all of you get comms sent to you, of healthcare, protections, new packages plans, workman's comp, things that get paid out to you if you get injured on the job and can't proldier anymore... Just, incredible safety net suddenly appears underneath you."
"Siobhan: What was this thing about, if any U4F ship is, you know, the support of the other U4F ships?"
Brennan: You see that there is a distress policy there. That there's a specific - you get access to a comms channel to like reach out a Beacon and alert other U4F airships.
"Ally: If we got access to any sort of like… directory, can I see if Jan is on there?"
Brennan: Oh you know Jan de la Vega-
(Cast cheers)
"Ally: Jan is there, now we're technically allies! I would like to shoot off an email to Jan that's like,"
"Margaret: Hello, fellow U4F member..."
Brennan: Comms channel opens up.
Jan de la Vega: You sorry sack of shit.
"Margaret: It's so great to be on the same side with you Jan, we all really look up to you."
"Jan de la Vega: You dodged a bullet this time, Encino, I'll tell you that for sure."
"Margaret: Well, thank you, your congrats means everything to me."
(laughing)
"Jan de la Vega: I tell you this, you better stay fresh with them dues Encino, because the first time you miss a payment, I'mma be on your ass, like green on a pond, sister-"
"Margaret: People pay money for an app that will remind them like that and you're telling me you're gonna do it for free? One less thing off my plate, thank you so much, Jan. I love you too."
Jan de la Vega: I'll give you a little kiss on the mouth.
(laughing)
"Ally: I'm like kinda turned on, okay, well bye."
(laughing)
"Brennan: Yes, U4F, hell yes. You get that little thing and that's one more problem gone! Jan De La Vega!"
"Ally: Incredible, I just have one more actual work thing to like breeze off and then one kind of, like, personal interest thing but I would love to get us to Jib Job Gold. What would we have to do for that?"
Lou: Jib Job Gold...
Ally: We already got a bar-
"Brennan: Hell yes, first of all, I'm gonna need everyone here to lose 50 credits and the ship to lose 320 ."
Ally: Cool.
Siobhan: Cool.
"Brennan: Also, did people do their lifestyle upkeep at the beginning of the nargon? Did people take the money off?"
"Emily: No but, what is lifestyle?"
"Brennan: Okay, so do that first, get rid of the 50 credits and the other stuff there. I will say this, you guys were living a poor lifestyle before, which made you very... Was not the most fun. If you would like to bump up, you decide what your lifestyle expenses will be for the next nargon. For 60 credits, it’s poor. For 300 credits, it's modest. For 600 credits, it's comfortable. And for 1200 credits, it's wealthy."
"Emily: Does this have a mechanical thing because Sundry Sidney's thinking that the most beautiful place she's seen was a pile of junk, so she's feeling like 60 credits-"
"Ally: Yeah, let's stay 60-"
Lou: Gunnie is good at 60.
Emily: She's like-
"Brennan: Yeah, you guys stay sleeping on cots next to a hot reactor."
"Emily: Okay, okay."
Siobhan: It doesn't make that much difference when-
Emily: So it's not like I subtract a D4 or something because I'm like living a lifestyle?
"Brennan: It probably should, but it does not."
Emily: Okay.
(Ally laughs)
"Brennan: So, that will be- I'm just remembering… I'm just remembering living in New York and I was like, I know I was getting some minus D4s to something."
(laughing)
"Brennan: So that is gonna be 60 credits from all you just for that lifestyle upkeep, cool. But you get that union membership, U4F, and you also see the main thing here, too, is there is a jobs board here, so now you have another... and these-"
Ally: Do the numbers-
Zac: These feel like legit jobs?
"Brennan: These are legit jobs. The numbers skyrocket, there is no five credit tug up on it once then I'm dead."
Emily: Can we actually turn around-
Ally: I'm gonna miss her.
(laughing)
"Brennan: Oh, you can do Smash 'n Grab, it's just these are-"
Zac: Can we just look at the offers?
Siobhan: Just have both of the apps running at the same time.
"Emily: It's like Grindr, you want to just, like, look at it when you're in a new city."
"Siobhan: Yeah, you're like-"
Emily: Get the lay of the land.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Hell yes, talk to me a little bit also about Jib Job Gold."
Ally: We would just love to make… Are there some updates that I can just quickly put into-
Zac: We just love- We would love to make an offer to Jib Job.
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: To go to- To go gold status with them?
Siobhan: Remind Crunch Moon that he is our best friend and-
Brennan: Do you wanna… If you wanna reach out-
"Ally: Absolutely, I send like the most incredible and personable emails to-"
"Brennan: It cuts to, fully in traction in a space hospital after the skiff accident..."
Siobhan: Oh no.
"Brennan: Where one of the Brigade Tigers smashed into his skiff, you see,"
"Crunch Moon-Jones: What up fam it's Crunch Moon! How're you doing, or-"
"Margaret: Oh, so good Crunch, it's great to see you."
"Crunch Moon-Jones: (slurred) How y'all doing? Hell yeah, what's up?"
"Margaret: So, as you know, we have our own Jib Job."
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Sick, that's right, you were telling me when you did that Kublacaine deal, that you actually have a Jib Job on your starship."
"Margaret: We have our own branch, and we're actually at silver status right now, which we're so happy about, but we were kind of wondering you're such an expert, obviously working for them. How would we get to gold?"
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Oh sick, for your Jib Job? If you put some upgrades in there you could probably get to gold status no problem."
Margaret: Like a masseuse or something?
Crunch Moon-Jones: What's that?
Margaret: Like a masseuse?
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Yeah, if you got like a masseuse in there-"
"Riva: Oh, what if we got a social media manager?"
Crunch Moon-Jones: Just for your Jib Job space?
Riva: Yeah.
Margaret: Yeah just for us.
Riva: Yeah.
Crunch Moon-Jones: Sure.
"Brennan: Actually, go ahead and make a persuasion check for me."
(laughing)
Ally: 18.
Brennan: 18.
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Yeah that's interesting, yeah, for sure you could do that."
(laughing)
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Yeah if you hire… If you hire a masseuse and a social media manager for... that's gold stuff, for sure."
"Margaret: Maybe it's the same person, we'll find out. Okay great, thank you so much Crunch. How are you doing?"
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Oh, so my whole body is just destroyed but pretty much- 'cause what happened was I was skiffing across the canyon and this like huge-"
Ally: I turn on subtitles.
"Crunch Moon-Jones: This huge- [Brennan drops the affectatious accent] This huge hot dog ship came by and totally like went by and it's like damn, dodged that, and then this Brigade Tiger totally came out of nowhere and like totally exploded my skiff and I was super dead inside the canyon. Then because I'm super rich, they brought me back to life."
(laughing)
"Sidney: Crunch, can I ask a question?"
Crunch Moon-Jones: Yeah.
Sidney: Have you seen Loose Duke around?
(laughing)
"Ally: Oh, my God."
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Oh, yeah, I've seen Loose Duke."
Emily: Is he lying?
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Yeah, I've seen Loose Duke all the time. He- he hit me up on my comm screen."
Margaret: What did-
Sidney: From where?
Riva: Your comm screen? From where?
"Sidney: What was the background like, where he was?"
Crunch Moon-Jones: Some kind of air vent.
(laughing)
"Zac: So maybe he knocked himself out in a vent, and then so, psychically, he wasn't able to be-"
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Yeah, he's like, he kept saying like, ""Crunch, get me out of this vent"" and I was like dude, I'm in traction."
(laughing)
Crunch Moon-Jones: I can’t get you out of the vent.
"Margaret: Were there any sounds in the background that you could kinda hear, or like-"
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Yeah, like air going through a vent."
"Margaret: No, like kind of ringing, or bells of like, I don't know, like a slot machine?"
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Just like machines that would be like in some kind of area, and then like a vent."
"Margaret: Oh my God, okay, well thanks so much, Crunch."
Crunch Moon-Jones: Sick!
Margaret: Call us- call me anytime.
Crunch Moon-Jones: Yeah-
Margaret: Just to chat.
"Crunch Moon-Jones: Yeah, awesome, I'm still in Baustin which is where the hospital's at, but like Skiff Fest was so- Are you going to Skiff Fest in the next cycle?"
Margaret: I hope so.
Crunch Moon-Jones: Tight.
Margaret: Tight.
Crunch Moon-Jones: You're my friend.
"Margaret: Yeah, you're my friend as well. Great talking to you, bye."
Ally: Click.
(laughing)
Emily: Margaret is so fake.
(laughing)
Brennan: Okay-
"Ally: Absolute two-faced, okay."
"Brennan: I was also gonna ask if, 'cause there were some other things here which were like the craniobolts-"
"Zac: I did wanna talk to Gunnie, knock on his- the door to the engine room."
"Gunnie: Hey, what's up pop- uh, Skip?"
"Skip: Hey, sport."
Gunnie: What's going on?
Skip: Nice piloting earlier.
"Gunnie: Hey, thank you, that was really awesome."
Skip: Yeah.
"Gunnie: I would… Maybe there's more of that in future, who knows? Anyway what are you doing? What's going on?"
Murph: Awesome.
"Skip: Well I just wanted to check in about that, also see if you want to look at my brain."
"Gunnie: Yeah, come on down, Here,"
Lou: I just push a bunch of like metal off of a table.
Zac: Just like-
"Gunnie: Yeah, go ahead and lay down."
Skip: Awesome.
Lou: I'd like to take a quick look at Skip's brain.
"Skip: Yeah, there's a piece of metal or something in there."
"Brennan: Yes, I will say you can see that there is a craniobolt in there."
Ally: Can we- can I say that I've trained my critical analysis on Gunnie?
Brennan: Yes.
"Ally: Like when we were, when you guys were talking about maybe doing this later."
"Lou: Yeah, I would like to… Can I do a lore check to what I know about craniobolts-"
Brennan: Yeah.
Lou: And what they're used for?
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah."
Lou: That's a cool 24.
"Brennan: Used to present... Used to prevent the psychic recovery of erased memories, like memory altering technology exists but it's not impenetrable, right? It can be reversed, like anything that is done can be undone. A craniobolt is a way of making that harder to get around. You can get a craniobolt out, it is brain surgery."
"Lou: Great, uh - could I do it?"
Brennan: It's a DC 30 medicine check.
Ally: What do you add to medicine?
"Lou: Plus three. Oh, plus three, yeah."
"Siobhan: I have a plus eight to medicine. If I crit, I would still not make it, but-"
"Lou: I could give you potent aptitude, and what if-"
Emily: Can I-
Ally: If you get plus five from my critical analysis?
Lou: And if we did it slowly-
"Emily: And can I enhance… Can you do it with your drone body, and I can enhance it so that it has advantage on wisdom checks? I'm guessing medicine is wisdom."
"Siobhan: Oh, I actually already have advantage- Oh, that's wisdom saving throws. Yeah."
Emily: Yeah.
Siobhan: That's wisdom.
"Brennan: So we could enhance a droid, throw a D6 potent aptitude-"
Ally: Train my critical analysis on them instead.
Brennan: With a plus five? Okay.
Emily: We're all-
"Siobhan: But, if I fail at this-"
Brennan: He's dead.
Siobhan: He does die.
"Brennan: Yeah, it is brain surgery."
Skip: Let's check it out.
(laughing)
Ally: Really?
(laughing)
"Murph: Really? I guess, ultimately the worm will be okay-"
"Zac: My question is, yeah."
"Siobhan: If yeah, okay."
"Zac: Is Skipper dead, or is Skip dead?"
Emily: I mean you could hop into another body while we do it.
"Brennan: In this case, Skip would not die."
"Brennan: Okay, all right."
Lou: I say we do brain surgery.
"Murph: Well, I think it's up to Skip. Skip, do you want us to do-"
"Skip: Yeah, let's do it."
(laughing)
Ally: Oh my gosh.
"Gunnie: Let's do brain surgery, come on!"
"Brennan: Amazing, cool."
"Gunnie: Ball's rolling up, let's do it."
"Ally: So wait, what do you have to get? You have a plus five-"
Siobhan: I have a plus eight to medicine.
Ally: And now you'll have a plus five because your next-
Lou: 22.
Zac: So 13.
Siobhan: So plus 13.
Brennan: Plus 13.
"Emily: And you're doing it with your drone body, so I can give you-"
Brennan: It's advantage-
"Siobhan: So I have advantage, so I need to get a 17."
Brennan: And then there's also a D6 you're rolling.
Siobhan: And there's a D6 I'm rolling.
Brennan: So we're committing to doing brain surgery?
"Lou: Gunnie, is fully like throwing a sheet over a table in his workbench, he gets a couple of lights going..."
Siobhan: This is maybe-
Gunnie: These I think would work as knives.
Siobhan: The scariest roll I've ever-
"Brennan: Okay, no we gonna do box of doom here."
Emily: I'm preparing the body.
Brennan: We are gonna do the box of doom. And I'm gonna throw-
Lou: Massaging it?
Siobhan: Do you have a favorite-
"Gunnie: Okay, that's good."
Siobhan: Do you have a favorite D6?
"Lou: I do, it's one that Ally gave me and it's got a-"
(laughing)
But it's something I've almost never touched.
"Brennan: Okay, we're doing box of doom, you guys just, sort of on a whim, do some brain surgery."
(laughing)
"Lou: It's not a whim, we took our time."
"Murph: Barry can't help, so he just has a cool bucket ready for the slug, should he need to jump out."
"Ally: Yeah, we've put like a little pillow in the bucket-"
"Sidney: Wait a second, before you jump out of this, if you potentially have to jump out of this body, do you have a body that you would like to jump into?"
Skip: Who is out there?
"Gunnie: We could grab Raymond? I mean, I like Raymond."
Barry Syx: You could grab Loose Duke?
Riva: He can survive as a worm for a bit.
Brennan: Do you-
Zac: Yeah maybe-
Brennan: He can survive as a worm for a long time.
"Ally: Okay, he can survive as a worm-"
"Emily: Okay, okay."
Murph: Do you think you would be… Could we share? Could you like-
Zac: Can I join you in your body?
"Ally: No, I don't think- (laughing) I don't think we have to do that."
"Murph: Just in case, just in case."
Ally: That's a great backup plan.
"Lou: Wait, real quick-"
Zac: We'd figure it out.
Lou: Can we go over our stuff just one more time?
Emily: Yes.
Ally: Okay.
Lou: So we are making sure we have as much as we possibly can-
Siobhan: Yes.
Lou: I am giving you a D6.
Siobhan: Yes.
"Zac: Yeah, awesome."
Lou: You are giving a plus a five-
"Ally: Plus five, so you already have a plus eight, so that's plus 13-"
Siobhan: 13.
"Lou: So that's it, and then you have-"
Zac: Is this a new day?
Brennan: Advantage.
Emily: Advantage?
Brennan: This is a new day.
Zac: Could I add my defiant to it?
Brennan: I will allow you to add your defiant to the roll as well to help.
Murph: Should we start with the advantage to see if you have it?
Zac: We have the box of doom.
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: Okay, so, box of doom."
Murph: If you hit a 17 with advantage-
Brennan: Throw the advantage first-
Lou: Here we go.
Murph: Here we go.
"Ally: 17, come on, come on."
"Siobhan: Crit, crit city."
Rolls a 5 and a 4
Oh boy.
"Emily: What happened, what happened?"
Brennan: That's a five… (laughing) and a four.
Zac: So we're done here. We're done here?
(Emily screaming)
"Brennan: Unless someone has a re-roll, or someone has some other-"
Zac: Can I use my supreme accuracy?
"Lou: I cast energetic... No, saving throw."
Siobhan: Can I direct myself?
Brennan: I will allow you to direct yourself.
"Siobhan: In which case, I roll a third die."
"Brennan: Okay, a third die-"
Siobhan: So like a potent- it's like a portent roll.
"Brennan: Yes, a third D20."
Siobhan: Okay.
"Ally: Oh my gosh, my heart."
Brennan: 17!
(screaming)
"Siobhan: Oh, I'm gonna live forever, and so is Skip!"
Murph: Oh my fucking God.
(screaming)
"Ally: What was that… Wait, you had one more portent kind of roll?"
"Siobhan: Yes, I have, yeah-"
: Yeah.
"Siobhan: I can give myself... I can, yeah."
"Ally: That the first roll, was actually--"
Siobhan: It was the worst thing I've ever seen.
Ally: Worst loss I've ever-
Siobhan: A four and a five.
"Brennan: 'Cause that would have been, even if you had rolled a six and a four it still would not have gotten you to 17."
Ally: No.
Ally: Two away.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Ally: Oh, my God."
"Brennan: Unbelievable, so I'll sort of...sort of, I would say from start to finish."
"Ally: Oh my god, that was so stupid!"
(laughing)
"Brennan: From the moment… From the moment where you walk in of like, hey I wanna check with this cranio-bolt. Three and a half minutes later, you are under the saw."
(laughing)
(buzzsaw surgery noises)
Riva: Whoops! Whoopsie!
"Gunnie: Hey, what's up? Everyone come on… If anyone wants to come on down, we're doing surgery!"
"Barry Syx: Yeah, I've got the cold bucket."
Emily: I'm putting--
(laughing)
Zac: Spicy!
Siobhan: Sloshing around–
Emily: I'm putting Handy Annie like a little computer down your nose for no reason.
(laughing)
"Gunnie: I think that's important, I don't think that is, I think we go around that."
Skip: Can I - do you want any help?
(laughing)
"Brennan: And you, pull this cranio-bolt out cauterize, seal up, oh you've got a little bit of but you don't have your pain sensors on. So there's sort of a weird throbbing series of stitches on the side of your head. Go ahead and make a piloting check for me and you can use Probe Mind to give advantage."
"Lou: I'm also gonna get the Bar Buddy in here for champagne, if this goes well."
Ally: Yes.
Lou: We just did brain surgery.
"Emily: Wait, but I feel like I'm kind of the champagne."
"Gunnie: Oh– Uh, I..."
"Sidney: Bar Buddy, get out of here."
"Gunnie: I'm sorry, get out of here."
Bar Buddy: What'll it be?
Ally: We take the Bar Buddy--
Sidney: You woulda shook it anyway.
Ally: No.
Zac: 26.
Brennan: 26.
Siobhan: Nice.
(zooming noises)
"Brennan: Norman ""Skip"" Takamori, your flashback, episode one of this campaign decorated by Analinda Weatherall."
Ally: That was another Weatherall?
"Brennan: Another Weatherall, Analinda Weatherall."
"Analinda: Listen, my cousin Gust, you gotta watch out for him, he means well but…"
Whooshing sound
"Gust: Skip, you know it's good to have somebody, that's got your back in this Brigade."
"Brennan: Lots of memories of your rise in the Brigade but always this bitterness towards other people and the fact that you were a good pilot and a good shot and were skilled in finding all these roads closed to you because people just...something about them made you bristle and your career never launched. It never went the way it should have until this guy came along and if someone finally had your back. Chamber music playing, see or some sort of like big band kind of, you know, Glenn Miller-esque. Everyone in their formal kind of naval whites had a cadet graduation. You are under the wing, formally, of Gust Weatherall. You've been here for a couple of cycles now but that's not bad, right? It's still gonna turn out in you favor, champagne popping, you remember champagne popping? Their champagne, other flash of memory you had on the trolley back in the Griivarr Worlds, blood and champagne. You see the cadets popping bottles."
"Cadets: Thanks for the champagne there, admiral!"
Gust: Ah it's all right you know you make a pretty penny when you make the stuff yourself.
"Brennan: You see labels on the champagnes saying Gusty Vines and it's a picture of the admiral raising a glass it's like his champagne, you're over in the corner beautiful deck of this like pleasure yacht hovercraft it's like this is not a Starship, it is an on-world oceanic like hover vessel, so it's like a hovering cruise ship as you sort of go out in this bay, beautiful Amercadian lights around, you see Gust looking over."
"Gust: Hey there Norman, good to see you pal. Yeah well, I know you want to talk to me about, me taking Hammond and kind of drumming him up but listen, new time's coming just around the corner my friend, just around the corner."
"Brennan: Move through and you see him looking at the stuff, he is pointing at the champagne. You see, he leans over to you and says,"
Gust: You wanna know how much I made selling this stuff back to the Brigade?
Norman: How much?
"Gust: Oh, a fortune, raked it over hand and fist, there's a bunch of these things, they tell you to do. You know they... For example, out in the place where I'm growing they said there's a huge sort of skiff rat problem and I said, skiff rats? Listen, I'm just gonna put out a bunch of rat poison. They said no you can't do it, the regulation... You put it out, the yield I get on these, I mean, this stuff costs me a quarter you know, it cost me a quacredit to get 10 bottles of this stuff made and I sell it for 15 credits a bottle."
"Norman: Is there any rat poison in… it's safe, right?"
"Gust: The rat poison stays on the ground, the rats eat the rat poison, the grapes don't grow on the ground, they grow on the vines."
Norman: Okay.
"Gust: Listen, it's like I've been saying,"
"Brennan: You see, over the corner a young cadet says,"
Cadet: To a proud future of serving the Brigade!
Brennan: And his head explodes.
Norman: [shocked into momentarily silence] Oh.
"Gust: Oh, shit."
"Norman: Did, uh...are there...is...? Are we being attacked?"
"Gust: The rats the heads explode the rats heads explode when they eat the poison, It's a special poison, it blows up the rats' heads. Oh, boy."
Norman: The poison makes the heads explode?
"Gust: Oh God, oh God, oh, God, everyone stopped drinking the champagne."
"Brennan: And they say,"
"Cadets: It's your champagne, admiral,"
Gust: Stop drinking the champa--!
(repeated popping noises)
"Gust: Oh, these are all cadets from the academy, oh there's a lot of important people's kids here, there's a lot of important people's kids here!"
Norman: I will do whatever you say.
(chuckling)
"Gust: You're gonna take the fall for this one. I mean, I have an opportunity for you."
"Norman: Yes, I missed the first part, what it was--"
"Gust: I have an opportunity for you, here's the thing. Oh, what happened? What happened? It's gotta be UFTP, that's what it is. United Free Trade Planets, this was a scam, 'cause they knew the graduating… This is an attack, we're gonna have to do… The Brigade won't stand for this. Here's what you're gonna do, I'm gonna get the bots, they're gonna clear all the champagne out of here. You're gonna get all these bodies and you're gonna take them in a shuttle and you're gonna fly them out to the other side of the bay not here, okay? We're gonna go back to the dormitories and you're gonna dump them. You're gonna dump them there and then you're gonna meet me here."
"Brennan: And you see he sends (boop sound) PICC, the Planetary Institute for Cognitive Cyber-Science."
"Gust: You're gonna meet me here, Norm, and all these problems are gonna go away."
Norman: Okay and then maybe we can talk about a promotion or something?
"Gust: Yeah, promotion, Norm. Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of you, all these problems are gonna go away."
Brennan: Memory starts to fade.
"Gust: It's good champagne, Norman, it's good champagne."
Skip opens his eyes to the crew cheering and pouring champagne of their own.
Margaret: Cheers.
"Skip smashes the glasses, shocking the crew into silence."
"Skip: The thing is, champagne makes your head explode."
"Sidney: What, but we've had it already."
"Gunnie: Yes, this is--"
Sidney: This is another bottle.
Gunnie: Champagne.
Margaret: I've been truly enjoying.
Zac: What brand is it? Can I see the bottle.
"Sidney: Grand Cruet, it's actually Grand Cru absorbed Moet and Chandon and now they call themselves Grand Cruet and that's my explanation for why I've been--"
Skip: As long as it's not Gusty Vines.
"Margaret: No, it's not Dusty Vines."
Skip: It's Gusty Vines.
"Margaret: Oh, Gusty's--"
Sidney: Your head is still open.
"Gunnie: Yeah, oh it's still a little bit blood--"
Skip: Is it exploding?
"Gunnie: No, no."
Skip squishes the flaps of his scalp closed.
"Zac: I relay what happened to Norman ""Skip"" Takamori."
Margaret: (whispered) That motherfucker...
"Sidney: Wow, but how did that..."
Riva: He's a bad person.
Sidney: So he got rid of your memory and then didn't even promote you? You tried--
Margaret: He made you--
Sidney: Get rid of you.
"Margaret: Clean up dead bodies whose heads had exploded, he made you transport them and then, what, stapled your brain? And so you, you took away a memory"
Emily: And then--
"Skip: Yeah, Norman's brain and I wanna be clear."
Margaret: Yeah.
Skip: That's not me.
"Margaret: Yeah I know, definitely."
"Riva: No, yeah."
"Margaret: No, no."
Riva: I do feel a little bit more sorry for Norman but at a certain point also you do make your own choices.
Sidney: I like you way better than Norman.
Margaret: Obviously--
Riva: Even Norman--
Margaret: It's not even… It's like talking about--
Riva: And I hope that he can hear that.
"Sidney: Yeah, Norman now that you're not here I feel brave enough to say, you were mean sometimes."
Gunnie: It's a weird time to kick...
Margaret: Weird time kicker.
"Sidney: I know, I know, Riva brought it up."
"Barry Syx: Just very casual brain surgery, at the risk of only his life."
Brennan: There's just like a lot of blood in the workshop.
(laughing)
Zac: I'm drinking some champagne--
Ally: Bloody hands holding champagne glasses.
"Brennan: Yeah like you kind of did this free hand, there they didn't even like steady yourself like he wasn't really--"
Ally: And so it's beautiful is what you're saying?
Brennan: Beautiful--
Ally: And it's beautiful--
Lou: The ball's rolling up.
"Sidney: How do you feel about this, Skip? I mean does it make… Just because you're inhabiting this body does it give you some of like the anger that Norman would feel at this guy?"
Skip: It's complicated because Norman sucked and this other guy sucks as well.
Margaret: Yeah--
"Skip: So I don't know that, I don't like this guy. And I know that he's responsible for killing so many people--"
"Ally: Yeah, can we go online right now and see if it's still being sold?"
"Murph: Did this UFTP, 'cause they wanted to blame it on UFTP, was there--"
Zac: Start a big war?
Murph: Was here a big fight between the two?
Ally: Yeah.
"Emily: Yeah, can I do like a lore check as to like what was the fallout From this alleged..."
Ally: Did I work on this coverup?
"Brennan: Yeah, I'm gonna say that you actually know this flat as a UFTP, you were not working at UFTP when all this went down but there was a period of time where this got pinned on United Free Trade Planets and the Brigade came after them. There was some like... There were some hot military zones when this happened a bunch of people died behind it and UFTP ended up like taking the blame, firing a bunch of people and it cost them a tremendous amount of money to settle with the Brigade. But your understanding was that basically some UFTP people had gone rogue. Now when you actually started working there you realized that the company... United Free Trade Planets basically took it on the Brigade's word and just like cut those losses. United Free Trade Planets are also villains, so when the Brigade was like, here's the heads of the people we want that were responsible, United Free Trade Planets didn't go like, those people are ours, we'll never let you have them. They just did the math and went those people are expendable it would cost more to protect than it would to just let them loose and--"
Ally: Are there names there or it's just like random?
Brennan: There are names but they're not… It's a list of names that are basically you know of people that already got tried and executed. Now United Free Trade Planets isn't aware of the fabricated nature of that information.
Ally: That's not a way now--
Emily: Yeah.
Ally: Now we have that. Is it still being sold? Gusty Vines?
"Brennan: You look it up, it's now 20 credits a bottle."
Emily: It's more expensive?
"Skip: Look I know that logically, I am not Norman ""Skip"" Takamori. Skipper"" Takamori. But I do wanna kill Gust Weatherall."
"Brennan: Well you also know this, this body, is the body that has made you the happiest you've ever been in and Gust Weatherall is trying to kill it. You've been framed for the murder of 12 Sisters of the Cosmic Veil. So Gust Weatherall is still coming after this body."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: Whether it is Skip or no.
"Emily: That's true 'cause he tried to frame you with the, at that place."
Zac: The Cloistered nuns.
Ally: Oh--
Emily: Yeah.
"Ally: Oh, may God, that was also Gust."
Emily: So--
"Murph: So, is there any way we can separate Gust from his comrades by--"
Siobhan: Killing him.
Murph: Revealing this plot?
"Zac: What if I pretended to have my memories back or like, not even pretending. But what if I told him?"
"Brennan: I'm sorry, Riva, you would know that the Brigade does employ psychics. If there was a Brigade psychic that was able to read--"
Siobhan: Oh yeah--
"Brennan: Norman's mind, like the cranio- Now that you guys have got the cranio-bolt out of there, any enterprising psychic could absolutely probe that."
"Siobhan: All right, here's a world lore question, what is the Starstruck equivalent of say, a Ricki Lake?"
"Brennan: Oh, Rootersnoos ferret, Jimmy the Snout."
"Siobhan: Great 'cause I bet, we're just Rootersnoos ferret Jimmy the Snout--"
Zac: 'Cause he has a daytime show?
Siobhan: Has a psychic that he employs on the reg… I would imagine.
Ally: That's incredible. I will point out that this could be helpful with dealing with UFTP as like a possible bargaining thing.
"Emily: Yeah, I'm almost thinking we keep it under the wraps."
"Ally: Just or we'll do whatever you want, [gestures to Zac] but yeah, do think also you--"
"Emily: I'm also kind of curious about this Planetary Institute of Cognitive, what was it?"
Brennan: Cyber-Science.
"Emily: Cyber-Science, it almost makes me wonder if there's like a bunch of secrets stored there."
"Brennan: So you get it… That's a huge insight and you do begin to realize like, shit we have that extra info about this institution. I wanted to real quick, I know there's a ton of stuff going on while you're hanging here in the Neutral Zone."
Siobhan: There really is.
"Brennan: But you guys are right, this is not just like, you guys are getting a lot of successes and moving forward big ways: you've joined U4F, you've talked to Auma and this is probably… Now you're on like your last Malton Unit before Gnosis is done doing their thing and Gnosis again says… Gnosis contacts Zortch and Zortch says,"
Zortch: Gnosis have let me know that any version of their plan working requires us getting them back to Rubian V. There's probably a bunch of different ways to do that but I will say anything we can do to get this ship ready to enter a sector with a lot of hostiles we should probably do.
Emily: Do you know if there's any sort of like ship building at Onolo Dos?
"Brennan: Oh, there's definitely a ton of nurseries on a Onolo Dos."
Murph: I'm gonna go pick her up and soup the ship up and get going?
"Emily: And also on the way, I mean if there's a job we could do to make the money to maybe help soup our ship up?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, maybe there's a union job we could do."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: The one last thing I wanna talk about was Acme-Ashmun, you reached out for that spot 'cause you have all those videos of Acme-Ashmun."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Go ahead… If you reach out with that email, go ahead and make a persuasion check as well. 'Cause you were reaching out on Gunnie's behalf."
"Ally: Can I check in with the group and be like, do we think that this is giving away like our location or do you feel okay with me reaching out and like trying to--"
"Gunnie: I mean we could always upload the videos like a few days later,"
Riva: Yeah.
Gunnie: When we've moved on.
Margaret: Yeah--
Gunnie: I mean--
"Ally: We have videos from a few fights ago, can cut together an incredible sizzle and write--"
Lou: Yeah can we hire someone in the Jib Job?
"Brennan: Are you incredible, okay someone give me a technology check to make it an incredible sizzle?"
Lou: I'll do it.
"Emily: Oh, yeah, I try and do it too."
Lou: I'll cut my own sizzle.
"Emily: All right, I'll give you a help action."
"Ally: I put my hand on your shoulder, you add plus five."
Lou: That's a...first one's a 30.
(laughing)
Murph: Barry gives way too many notes.
Lou: Second one's a nat 20.
(screaming)
"Emily: Wow, you crit on your own sizzle!"
"Brennan: Okay, I'm gonna say go ahead, go ahead and roll me with a Nat 20, you're going to add a plus 10 to this and you can roll with advantage. But it's also a persuasion check."
Lou: The beginning is just that like a quick time lapse of like the sun rising and falling--
"Ally: 17 plus 10, 27."
"Brennan: You get a response back, that just says,"
"Mother Void, this is the best sizzle I've ever seen in my life. Also please tell Gunnie I said hello."
"Signed,"
Dora Valentine.
Lou: Who is that person?
Zac: Is that the person who worked at the ship?
"Brennan: Your old professor, who is now responding from the Acme-Ashmun account saying,"
"Dora: I'm in office all unit, hit me up on a comm screen if you wanna talk."
Margaret: Do you wanna talk?
"Gunnie: Yeah, yeah, it would be nice, it would be nice, it would be nice–"
"Margaret: Great, yeah I can call it, it'll do be one-on-one, you can be right off camera and decide if you wanna enter in--"
Gunnie: I like that--
"Ally: Okay great, I call. What was her name again?"
Brennan: Dora Valentine.
Ally: Great.
Gunnie: She's very sweet.
"Brennan: Dora Valentine, comes up. You see the Acme-Ashmun on some like frosted doors behind her but she still looks like an academic, sort of like funky bead glasses, like bare shoulders and a kind of like flowy robe looking thing. And you see, she looks up and goes,"
Dora: As I live and breathe...
"Margaret: Sorry, I should have had you more off screen."
"Brennan: No, sorry you saw."
"Gunnie: No, it’s fine, I wasn't trying to hide!"
Margaret: That's my bad--
Zac: Just like halfway.
Lou: It's just like
Emily: You would think Margaret would learn how to frame a fuckin' Zoom
"Ally: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm losing my edge the funky frames I was just."
"Brennan: You see, she looks at you and says,"
Dora: Gunthrie Miggles-Rashbax.
"Gunnie: It's me. A little different, but it's me."
"Dora: Incredible, well you know, I had heard rumors your fathers are both well, I'm not sure if you're in touch with them at all."
"Gunnie: No I haven't really talked since I decided not to be a published author and instead, go to space."
"Dora: Well I also departed from academia, Acme-Ashmun made an offer that I could not refuse as you're aware, astronavigation they make a tremendous number of starship parts in addition to cybernetics and I was very surprised to see this inquiry about sponsorship rush across my desk. What are you considering? What does an Acme-Ashmun sponsorship look like to you?"
"Margaret: Well for us I think, given like past rates which I can completely CC you on, we would want full debt forgiveness and a monthly stipend. And we could continue to make Acme-Ashmun forward content."
"Brennan: She looks at you, give me another persuasion check."
Ally: Okay.
Lou: Potent aptitude?
Zac: Triple advantage for the content--
Emily: Is hearing Acme-Ashmun forward content.
Ally: 25.
Lou: You can add D6.
Ally: 27.
"Lou: Two 2s, I'm disappointed."
"Ally: Yeah, I know."
"Lou: I would do better, my potent aptitude will be better."
"Brennan: She looks at you and says,"
"Dora: Fascinating. Well, I've heard some extraordinary things, now we stay apprised, here's the issue right now, Ms. Encino, as you're well aware, your debts are no longer on our books."
Margaret: Exactly.
Dora: So it would be a complex corporate disentanglement to go after the loan repayment agency we sold it to who in turn sold it to Repo Reapers.
Margaret: And you're telling me right now that Acme-Ashmun isn't involved in buying and selling debts? And it's not as fluid as I would imagine--
Dora: I can--
Margaret: That doesn't sound that complicated.
"Dora: Well, I would be happy to make some calls, the amount of debt we would be repaying in exchange for the sponsorship would require some pretty incredible brand activation, how willing to activate this brand are you?"
"Gunnie: High, the most active, I'll do just about anyth-"
Margaret: Yeah definitely Gunnie--
Gunnie: Just about anything.
Margaret: As you can see.
"Gunnie: If you want me to change my name or scream the brand out all the time, we can… I can write on all of my rocket, I have rockets, I'll write on all of my rockets--"
"Dora: Well, let's talk about what we're gonna want, we're gonna want a logo on the side of the vessel but of course if the logo was on the side of the vessel we would be more than happy to supply you with actual Acme-Ashmun force shields."
"Brennan: This is an enormous deal, what she's talking about is the best force shields in the Galaxy."
Dora: So we would make sure that you had the equipment that you needed. There is a brand activation that we can consider to begin this process.
"Brennan: You see, she says,"
Dora: How familiar with you… Just how familiar are you with the Battle of the Brands?
Margaret: No.
Gunnie: We've been in space doing stuff--
"Ally: I would imagine, I am--"
"Brennan: Battle of the Brands is an enormous, once a cycle fighting competition in Mas Vegas, at the Kubla-Kola Gladiatorial Arena."
"Margaret: We're familiar, yeah definitely."
Dora: If the crew of your ship?
"Ally: We have a brick, we have a brick of Kublacaine. I mute us - we have a brick of Kublacaine"
"Brennan: She says,"
"Dora: If you participate in the Battle of the Brands, she says, our droid unfortunately was taken out of commission during the last Battle of the Brands. So we find ourselves without an ability to fulfill our contractual obligations. However, seeing as you've made some splashes in the news with your flashy departure from Rec 97, this brand activation could work to our benefit if your crew agrees to associate the Wurst with the Acme-Ashmun brand. And if you participate in the fight we would be more than happy to supply your ship with these force shields and give each of you a signing bonus of 10.000 credits."
Margaret: And what about the debt in question here?
"Dora: Well, I'd be happy to let you know that that will be no problem if you win the fight. The fight has a fight purse of 1.2 million credits."
"Margaret: Who is entering the fight, only Gunnie?"
"Dora: Some other brands will be submitting champions but if you're interested, we'd be more than happy to submit you."
Gunnie: Will we fight as a team or is it just me?
Margaret: Or is it just Gunnie?
"Dora: Oh, teams are allowed to compete together."
Gunnie: We're in!
"Margaret: No, we're - we– Listen--"
"Sidney: I'm sorry I was listening, I wanna fight."
Ally: I somehow mute everyone but me.
The cast silently make very enthusiastic gestures as Ally talks
Margaret: We would love it if you would draw up the paperwork for this for us to give a once-over and send through our legal team and I will get back to you within three business days.
Dora: Very well.
"Brennan: You see she sends over, Battle the Brands. You will be competing against brand champions for Kansas Corn Cakes, which is an Amarcadian Corn Cake company. A team of gladiators from Uncle Bob's Fantanimalland, and a Galactic Girl Guides champion for their biggest selling brand of cookies, Triangle Mint Cookies."
"Ally: Young girls, fighting a group of young girls with their cookies."
"Brennan: You're not sure who the champions are but those are the… It's the Battle of the Brands. So the brands are Acme-Ashmun, Kansas Corn Cakes, Uncle Bob's Fantanimaland and Triangle Mint Cookies."
"Ally: And this was a good deal, you think? 'Cause these are like insane--"
Emily: is there--
Murph: It's a sure win.
Siobhan: Can we get all of these things regardless of how we do in the contest?
"Emily: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.--"
Siobhan: If we win?
Ally: Only the debt is contingent on us winning.
"Brennan: Yes, basically the debt is contingent on you winning 'cause there's a 1.2 million credit purse."
Siobhan: Okay.
Ally: Insane.
Brennan: But all of you for participating get a 10.000 credit bonus each.
Siobhan: I mean yes--
"Emily: Can I look at the contract, and like scan through to see what happens if we take this and then in two months we get rid of the logo on the side of the ship?"
"Ally: Yeah, like how long is this contract?"
Siobhan: Tell me how long--
Ally: Tying us to Acme-Ashmun? Lifetime?
Brennan: It's a three cycle deal.
Emily: Three cycle deal?
Zac: Okay.
Emily: Okay.
Siobhan: 18 months.
"Emily: Year and half, okay."
"Lou: And, guys, if we win the Battle of Brands, it doesn't all have to go to my--"
"Ally: It will absolutely all go to you. Okay, wow that's insane."
"Emily: I mean, before we were talking about trying to break into like the loan Repo people."
Ally: Yeah definitely.
Emily: This is way better and more fun.
Zac: Only 9 reigons.
"Ally: I'll send back my edits to this paperwork pretty much it will just like guarantee us security for you for being so visible. There will be like no loan sharks, who can attack you while we're trying to get there some sort of like--"
Emily: Oh yeah.
"Ally: You know, like security detail for us as a team showing up in such a public place."
Emily: And if we go to this place--
Ally: Anything else that we want?
Emily: I want some more grenades.
Ally: And 19 grenades.
Emily: 19 grenades.
"Brennan: Cool, so wait, what's the counter are you coming back with?"
"Ally: I'm coming back with I want security detail for our crew due to our like visibility in the news recently, 19 grenades,"
"Gunnie: Yeah well, I mean we are their champion let's get them to sponsor- Barry! You need those specialized power cells for the rotary cannons right?"
"Barry Syx: I still need some special power cells, so yeah."
"Gunnie: Let's demand, let's include equipment for the fight."
Margaret: How many power cells?
Barry Syx: I could use a few power cells and then specialized power… I'm not sure exactly what they're called but basically better power cells to do my--
Ally: I add these to the list.
"Brennan: Cool you add 19 grenades, you add the power generator for the rotary cannon--"
"Emily: Stun and incendiary, please."
"Brennan: You add the power generators for the rotary cannon, you hear back as you send the deal… You see she says,"
"Dora: Accepted. We have an executed copy of the deal here for you, just sign and return. Asterix - urgency is of the essence. Check in for the fight is in four Marbecs."
Ally: Wait \- four hours?!
(screaming)
(laughing)
Barry Syx: Yes! Yes!
Lou: Gunnie right now starts doing our astronavigations and once he's alone just fully starts crying. Is doing calculations… 3.1467121
(crying)
Emily: I'm just fucking shredding some push ups.
"Ally: I sign, I guess."
"Brennan: You sign and send it back. You make a jump to hyperlight, you go and appear in space with an Acme-Ashmun force of private security around you to guide you. You are over the lava world of Lavada And you see--"
Ally: Lavada.
Brennan: Lavada. A burning hellish magma world and a beautiful glimmering like swimming pool blue oasis floating 20 miles in the atmosphere over the lava surface. It's Viva Mas Vegas and that's all for this episode--
Ally: No--
"Brennan: Of ""Dimension 20,"" tune in next week for the Battle of the Brands! See ya in the stars!"
Lou: Wow.
"Emily: Oh, I cannot fuckin' wait."
Ally: Wow.
Emily: I'm so excited about this.

"Ally: I'm a polyglot, can I try to speak to the Plinth?"
"Brennan: Sure, you wanna speak to Plinth?"
"Ally: I just wanna say,"
Margaret: Do you want to be fighting?
"Brennan: Plinth enters into the heart of your mind, you watch the explosion, implosion and ending of the universe in the consumption of ultimate entropy."
Plinth: Looks like the Triangle Mint plinth out there is having some kind of psychic conversation with Margaret Encino.
"Ally: I love you, Plinth."

(upbeat music)
"Brennan: Hello, one and all! Welcome back to another thrilling episode of Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey. I'm your humble dungeon master, Brennan Lee Mulligan, with me as always are our intrepid heroes! Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes."
Ally: What's up?
Brennan: Everyone dressed up.
Ally: I don't know what you're talking about. I've been looking like this-
Siobhan: These are my real clothes.
Ally: For the past couple weeks.
Brennan: The important thing is everyone's wearing their normal clothes and that we return to find our intrepid heroes-
Zac: It's normal.
Brennan: It's normal.
"Murph: This is super normal, everybody."
Lou: This is who I am.
"Brennan: It is fight night here at the Kubla-Cola Gladiatorial Arena in Mas Vegas, Lavada, and the brand new champions for the Acme-Ashmun Corporation. Last we left off, the Wurst was hanging in space in the neutral zone, having just fled from the Griivarr Worlds."
(group laughing)
"Brennan: You awakened the planetary supercomputer's holofract, Gnosis, reuniting it with its origin in a piece of Terran hardware and having it speak to you about what it should do in a galaxy full of people that want to take advantage of it. After speaking with the Princeps Zortch and The Gunner Channel, Gnosis arrived at some kind of plan to perhaps save the people of Rubian V from the ravages of United Free Trade Planets, maybe do something about other galactic problems, who knows, debt super computing, and find a way of dispersing itself, because Gnosis acknowledged that as long as it exists, people will seek after it. All of you use the time before Gnosis was developing some sort of scheme, which is theoretically still developing here on the last Malton unit of that four Malton unit period of time. You contacted Auma Liu on the planet Onolo Dos, where she told you that she still had the trademark for Sundry Sidney. You reached out to U4F and talked to your union rep, Ife Amari-Reyes, who said that she'd be happy to process your union membership as long as you also agreed to become a facilities den for a group of Galactic Girl Guides. You discovered that Jan De La Vega is a fellow union member-"
Ally: Woo!
"Brennan: In the Federation. Oh, you reached out, and then of course, to Dora Valentine, your former professor, who now works at the Acme-Ashmun Corporation and who processed your sponsorship, saying, if you can, there is a 1.2 million credit fight purse at The Battle of the Brands."
Murph: Transfer it to our account now.
Lou: Yeah.
(group laughing)
"Brennan: I'm gonna level with you, audience watching at home. I have never been less certain of a PC victory in my life as we head to The Battle of the Brands. But the good news is even if we don't win, you still get a 10.000 credit signing bonus each as well as brand new Acme-Ashmun force shields as long as you survive the fight."
Ally: Quick question on the paperwork.
Brennan: Yes.
"Ally: If Gunnie gets super injured and his parts get trashed, are they replaced by Acme-Ashmun after this fight?"
Brennan: Gimme a finance check real quick.
Lou: Margaret would've made an airtight contract.
Ally: I would've made an airtight contract.
Brennan: Let's find out how airtight.
Murph: As tight as my ponytail right now.
Siobhan: Murph's eyebrow's are almost into his hairline.
Ally: Do you wanna know that number?
"Brennan: Yeah, what's that number?"
Ally: 28.
Brennan: 28?
Lou: Let him know that number. Let him know that number!
"Brennan: Incredible, incredible. Yes, at this point, should you need, much like they're supplying you force shields, they are not replacing your parts, but should you need replacements, they will be providing them as part of the sponsorship. However, I will point out there are some pretty hefty brand stipulations in here. Number one, you need to have a big, ol' Acme-Ashmun logo on the side of your spaceship, which is not unusual, because you are gonna have the shields out there on the side of the ship."
Lou: Yeah.
"Brennan: But you also need to comport yourselves as brand ambassadors for Acme-Ashmun. Now the, so-"
Ally: There was a lifestyle contract in there?
(group laughing)
"Brennan: Now, the lifestyle-"
"Emily: Yeah, what exactly?"
"Brennan: Now the lifestyle contract is not what it would be if you were working in the children's entertainment division at Griivarr Enterprises. Acme-Ashmun is a military company. They make like cybernetics and like force shield technology, so it's not about looking wholesome. It's about looking competent."
Emily: Right.
Brennan: You need to comport yourself in such a way that you make the brand look good.
Emily: Is there a clause on drugs?
"Murph: Yeah, can we do drugs?"
Brennan: Give me one more finance check.
"Ally: I mean, the answer's yeah, right? Everyone in World War II was like on meth. Nat 20."
(group laughing)
Brennan: You are required to do a certain amount of drugs.
(group applauding)
Siobhan: Yes!
Zac: Yes!
Lou: Drugs!
Brennan: Drugs!
Ally: There is no loser in this equation.
Lou: Exactly.
"Ally: No, not us, not our bodies."
Lou: Nobody loses.
"Ally: Nobody loses, they get people, they get quick-working cogs,"
Zac: It's a win-win.
"Brennan: You actually see that basically, within your contract it becomes clear, Acme-Ashmun's former- the android that it had going to the Battle of the Brands, and also its former sponsorship was in a very outmoded cycle of AnarchEra where they were trying to pursue big faction contracts. And basically they are pivoting their strategy to appeal to the ever-widening Proldier market. That's where they feel the real money can be made."
Players: Oh.
"Brennan: As sort of moving from private contracts into retail, so-"
"Ally: I mean, we are the Proldiers. We're the cover babies."
Siobhan: The gig economy. Mercenary life.
"Brennan: There you go, exactly."
Ally: Do we know who that android was that got broken? What was the model?
"Brennan: That would've been Wiley Wes, the Acme-Ashmun android."
Ally: Thank you.
Brennan: So-
Emily: What's the fate of Wiley Wes?
Brennan: Wiley Wes was badly injured and has been taken outta commission.
"Siobhan: Oh, wow."
"Emily: Full, the line is totally gone?"
Brennan: Wiley is the name given to this particular Vercadian protector droid.
"Emily: Oh, it is. I thought it would be a Vercadian protector droid."
"Siobhan: But there was only one of them and there's six of us. And so, you know."
"Brennan: The Wurst hovers down. You can signaled on your comms. You can see you are actually in a comms deadening bubble, sort of like a sort of globe of invulnerability where it's blocking other things. And you get hailed from one of your security officers coming in."
(intercom beeping)
"Ross: Uh, hi, this is Ross. I'm one of the pilots here for your Acme-Ashmun security detail, letting you know that we're aware that there are certain factional elements in pursuit of you. So we've gone ahead and done you the courtesy of killing your comms and sort of deadening your call sign on arrival. I wanted to talk to you real quick. I got a message from Dora Valentine. In terms of your exit strategy, because our understanding is that you are highly wanted by a number of powerful factions and that this fight will be airing live across various rec station channels."
"Margaret: Yeah. Ross, was it?"
Ross: Yeah.
"Margaret: Okay, great. Yeah, we were hoping that maybe you could fabricate a hot dog ship that looks much like ours and send it the opposite direction."
Ross: Okay.
Margaret: Of where we need to go at the end of this.
Ross: Copy that.
Margaret: That will blow up.
(group laughing)
Margaret: That will blow up 20 minutes away.
Sid: Maybe sort of like a blimp filled with grenades.
Ross: Mm-hmm. Grenade... blimp.
"Margaret: If you can do that, Ross."
"Ross: Got it, yeah, absolutely."
"Margaret: Great. I send you like the dimensions of our ship or something, like a little schematic?"
"Brennan: He says,"
"Ross: Great. So this is a discontinued Amercadian mess freighter? Yeah, we can absolutely try."
"Margaret: Thank you so much, Ross, we really appreciate working with you."
(group laughing)
Brennan: The look down. The look down while finishing-
Zac: Thank you so much.
Brennan: Already moved on.
Ally: Thank you so much.
"Emily: When Ross departs, can I have like a word with Margaret and everyone?"
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely. You're on the bridge. So right now, you are descending into the lava planet. As you do, you see this planet is hell itself. It is a roiling magma ball. And as you start coming in through the atmosphere, just choking smoke and ash, you come through a layer of the smoke, see radiating heat waves. And on this little platform, just sort of like bright, palm green and like, again, like sort of swimming pool, that like chlorinated, teal blue, this little, floating paradise platform floating over the lava by about like 18 miles."
Ally: Is it heaven or Mas Vegas?
"Brennan: Is it heaven or Mas Vegas? Exactly. Tons of beautiful lights, incredible- Everything is gold and marble and palm trees and water. You see that the platform has, clearly, some kind of force shield underneath it, protecting it from the incredible heat of the planet that it is on. And tons of water is just spilling off the sides of Mas Vegas, hitting the force shield, immediately evaporating and creating this kind of like steam bubble. So the edges of the city, as you lower into it, are just towering columns of steam... roaring up. So you seem to be sort of like encased in mist, but can see a sort of like light pollution, like the light of the city hitting the walls of steam and commingling with like the choking smoke overhead. As you land on this platform, you can go ahead and have this conversation on the bridge."
Sid: I have a slight concern that it's possible that we could be being set up.
"Riva: Oh, yeah."
"Sid: So that someone, I mean, there's no reason that Acme-Ash wouldn't want- So I was kind of thinking we should get that under wraps somehow and maybe make sure that the security detail is not on our ship and maybe try and park close enough that Riva can go back into the ship if she needs."
"Margaret: Great. Yeah, let's take all of those precautions. That's a great idea."
Sid: Right?
Riva: That's a good idea.
Brennan: Amazing.
Skip: Put a blanket on Gnosis or something?
Sid: Yeah.
Riva: Yeah.
"Gunnie: A few extra coffee cups, so-"
"Margaret: Yeah, yeah, definitely."
"Gunnie: So it's just super like, that's a table."
"Margaret: A stack of mail, yeah."
"Sid: Maybe a sign on the bathroom that's like,"
(group laughing)
"and like, Gnosis sits in there."
"Sid: Okay, so like, yeah, let's put Gnosis in the bathroom."
Barry Syx: In the bathroom.
"Margaret: Let's make the bathroom smell awful, put Gnosis in there."
Riva: Do not go in there!
(group laughing)
"Brennan: You take some precautions to hide Gnosis on the ship. Zortch and Raymond Zam agree to watch out for this place. Zortch just like parks it. They go like,"
Zortch: I'm gonna park it on the bridge with a gun in case anyone shows up and tries to do anything with the ship.
"Gunnie: Damn, Zortch."
"Zortch: I,"
(group laughing)
"I'm here, I'm ready, okay? I am ready."
Aurora Nebbins- (snarls)
"Sid: Yeah, should we bring Aurora to the fight?"
Riva: I think she would be very valuable to us.
"Sid: Okay. Okay, I'm just like feeling like there's probably gonna be some psychics who maybe distort her mind to then attack us."
Riva: Well a lot of psychics can't-
Sid: Because she's so sweet.
Riva: She's so sweet. A lot of psychics-
Skip: She's really sweet.
Riva: A certain level of-
Barry Syx: She's a beautiful dog.
"Sid: Oh, she's beautiful."
Riva: Of wisdom or intelligence cannot affect you because you have no idea what's going on.
"Emily: She's got a minus four to intelligence, so hopefully."
Siobhan: A minus four?
"Sid: All right, we'll bring her then."
Lou: Yeah.
Sid: Aurora?
(Brennan snarling)
Emily: I rip off a terrapin leg.
"Ally: Oh my God, why? Why?"
Gunnie: Feed the whole thing! Just feed the whole thing!
"Murph: I've gotten so used- Barry so quickly mercy kills it. It's like in tandem, whenever we're in the gunner thing and she feeds it, I shoot it in the head as soon as the leg is gonna go off."
(group laughing)
"Barry Syx: I don't like doing this, but ultimately this is, I am the angel of mercy."
"Brennan: You guys see the ramp extends down. The Jib Jobbers all get ready to go home for the night, sort of waves."
Zac: Angel of mercy...
"Brennan: You see a bunch of new Jib Jobbers come aboard, as well."
"Riva: Hi, welcome."
Ally: I shake each of their hands.
"Jib Jobber: Hey, nice to meet you, nice to meet you."
Margaret: It's great to meet you.
"Brennan: As they do, you guys see, again, some representatives from Acme- Ashmun show up. They say, alright, well, check-in at the fight is in about a Marbec and a half, but is there anything that you'd like to do prior to, you wanna be taken to your suite, taken to the locker room, get ready? Whatever it is you wanna do."
Margaret: I might need to stop by a store really quick.
Sid: Yeah.
"Barry Syx: Yeah, we gotta pick up some stuff."
"Gunnie: Munitions, we need to pick up."
"Sid: I think we wanna do a little shopping and also if there's some sort of, you know, bar where folks like us hang out."
Margaret: Yeah.
Riva: The cool people.
"Margaret: Yeah, we wanna go to like wherever the seediest den is."
Brennan: I'm gonna say you do not have enough time to use any background features.
Murph: Cool.
"Sid: Then just a store, thank you."
Barry Syx: We'll just go to a store.
Gunnie: We'll just go to a store.
"Riva: I don't suppose you have any information on the other teams that we're competing against, do you?"
"Sid: Yeah, that's what I was kind of curious about."
"Gunnie: Yes, I mean-"
"Riva: They're probably pretty famous, right?"
Gunnie: I'm assuming there's talk of like-
"Riva: Yeah, people."
"Gunnie: I mean, of course, we're the new hot shots, but you know, I'm assuming there's, you know, scuttlebutt."
Acme-Ashmun Representative: Absolutely. We can give you all a rundown on that. We actually have a whole schematic that we're gonna be able to run for you guys to sort of break down the opponents for you when we arrive at the hotel.
"Gunnie: That's a PowerPoint, yeah."
"Sid: Great. And then, what is this- How long does this go for?"
A-A Rep: The last one lasted about… 30 seconds.
Riva: Great.
Barry Syx: Right on.
Sid: Thank you.
Brennan: You guys are driven in this long limousine through the streets of Mas Vegas.
Lou: Are there drinks in the back? Is there shots?
"Brennan: Oh, yeah, you see there's some drinks in the back."
Sid: Put it in my gun first!
"Brennan: You guys pass by a number of famous, you see the Midas, the Nero, the Andalusian, all these incredible, famous casinos. You look out in front of them. A bunch of the outsides of the casinos are populated with Running In Place parlors. You know that Running In Place is a business that allows you to enter this pod and sell years off your life. It's sort of a life extension thing-"
Siobhan: Oh God.
"Brennan: Where you can go, like if you pay a lot of money, you can go get your life extended but if you wanna make money, you can sell years off your own life. You see a lot of them are placed immediately outside the doors of casinos."
Emily: Oh.
"Siobhan: Oh God, that is so wrong."
Ally: R.I.P.
"Brennan: Yeah, Viva Mas-"
Emily: Running In Place.
Brennan: Running In Place. R.I.P.
(Emily laughing)
Viva Mas Vegas.
Zac: That'll never happen to me.
Ally: Yeah.
Siobhan: I know when to stop.
"Ally: Yeah, our whole group really famously-"
Brennan: Really famously knows.
Lou: I was gonna do one of those. I was gonna do one of those ones.
Zac: Gunnie's just sprinting.
(group laughing)
Brennan: You see a little sort of comm on your news as you're going to the weapons store.
"News: This is Rootersnoos Ferret, Jimmy The Snout live, coming to you from Madrugada Station above Rubian V. Billions of pilgrims from all over the galaxy have made their way to this moon of the gas giant, Rubian, to attempt to stop the outbreak of violence. Coming together, holding hands in a vigil. Pilgrims say they are more than happy to do whatever is necessary to stop the further escalation of outright war in the sector."
Brennan: You continue along in your-
Lou: In our limousine?
Zac: Same. (cocking gun)
(group laughing)
"Brennan: And you guys arrive at, you sort of go some place in town. You see a weapon store, like brilliant, neon signs everywhere. It is a four story, like big box."
Ally: Here we go.
"Brennan: Guns, ammunitions, ships' weapons, just like every kind of weapon you could ever want in this enormous department store."
Emily: Are there also drones like Riva uses?
Brennan: They do sell psychodrones here.
"Murph: Sweet, I have a shopping list. Do other people have a shopping list?"
Ally: Yes.
Emily: I do have a shopping list.
Zac: I have one thing.
"Murph: Is it gonna be same price as things in the player's handbook, or-"
Brennan: Here? (die clatters) It's gonna be a 20% markup on everything.
Murph: Dammit.
Emily: Okay.
Murph: Okay.
Emily: Should we just like write down our list and send it to you?
Brennan: Only mention it to me if it costs more than 400 credits.
"Emily: Okay, actually, I have to mention everything to you. I would like to get a fragmentation charge, a hunting rifle and a thermal detonator."
"Brennan: Perfect, you can do all of it."
"Emily: Actually, I have the money. I'd like two thermal detonators. Can I actually borrow money to get two thermal detonators?"
"Ally: Yeah, definitely."
Siobhan: Absolutely.
Brennan: Let me see what the hell I'm agreeing to.
(group laughing)
"Zac: And I would love fiber armor, if they have that here."
Lou: I think I'll also buy fiber armor.
"Brennan: Fiber armor, cool."
Lou: I would also like fiber armor.
Emily: Fiber armor.
"Brennan: So spend whatever you're gonna spend, and then at the end of doing that, it's a fifth of whatever you spent-"
Murph: Cool.
Brennan: On top of it.
"Murph: I've got, so I've already done the math. I'm going to spend $6.852. I'm gonna buy a revolver."
Brennan: Okay.
Murph: Which is a one handed gun.
Brennan: Cool.
"Murph: I'm gonna buy a heavy shield generator, which is a plus three offhand AC thing. And then composite armor, which will get my AC up to 17. That's 2.500 credits."
Lou: Okay.
Murph: And then the other stuff is all little.
Ally: Does the heavy shield have like a carrying capacity to it?
Murph: The shield generator does not.
Ally: Okay.
Murph: And it's 1250.
"Ally: Okay, great, yeah. That's something I was gonna get, too."
"Brennan: So you, you guys are going back to broke fast."
Lou: Yes!
Zac: Go big or go home.
Siobhan: How much do the psychodrones cost?
Brennan: 400 credits each.
"Siobhan: Oh, great, then I'll buy three."
Brennan: Great.
(group laughing)
You go ahead and buy three psychodrones.
(Emily laughing)
"Hell yeah, great, great, great. They do sell a device that links them up."
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: If you want. Obviously, you can't split your consciousness into all three."
Siobhan: No.
Brennan: But you can like bring some spares out with you.
"Siobhan: Yes, exactly. That's what I would like to do."
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: However much that costs.
Brennan: That one costs 800.
Siobhan: Great.
"Lou: And then I'd like the parts, I'm still considering it, but can I get the parts to possibly modify my auto-injector or an auto injector-gadget that I might be working on?"
"Brennan: Yes, you can go ahead and grab that. We'll call that a cool 500 credits."
Lou: Great.
"Sid: Okay, I actually need to borrow $2.000."
Gunnie: It's yours.
Sid: Okay! (Emily laughing)
"Gunnie: Yeah, it'll come out of my pocket."
Brennan: You guys-
"Riva: Wait, I'll lend it to you, because you have things that you need to spend money on-"
"Gunnie: No, it's fine, I actually really don't."
Riva: All I want is for you to pick out a fridge magnet for me.
Sid: I actually have a really good magnet to decorate one of your drones with.
Lou: Oh my God.
Siobhan: Then 2000 Credits from me.
Emily: Thank you.
"Brennan: So you guys have like a hover trolley behind you and a couple of like these Acme-Ashmun escorts who are just picking stuff up and a mountain of gear begins to go up. It's like beep, beep, beep. And you're seeing like going into the thousands, heading well over like five figures of credits."
(group laughing)
"Ally: Yeah. Yeah, it is going over five figures, for sure."
Murph: I spent so much money.
"Ally: I spent a lot of money. Can we say that, I dunno if this is near any other stores, but I would love to pop in somewhere and find my exact suit, but in black leather."
"Brennan: Perfect, yes."
Ally: And trade in that and then get two bands to put all my grenades on.
Emily: Yeah!
Brennan: Incredible.
"Ally: I just look exactly the same, and I want a new, like a- a stronger case for my cell phone."
(group laughing)
Bulletproof case.
"Brennan: A bulletproof- You get to the front and looking at all the stuff you're buying, the cashier actually does just take a bulletproof cell phone holder."
"Ally: Incredible. It's like those stories of like my granddad was shot in the war, but he had a metal Bible in his pocket and it saved him. That's what I want."
Brennan: Okay. You guys buy an extraordinary amount of gear.
Emily: I actually have one more thing.
Ally: War lords!
"Emily: I have one more thing to ask about, and I haven't found anything about this. Is there any sort of… armor for service animals?"
"Brennan: Uh, yeah. There's a couple different types of armor available for service animals."
Emily: For Aurora?
Brennan: You could absolutely get Aurora Nebbins some armor here.
"Emily: Um, I am out of money."
Siobhan: How much is it?
"Lou: Yeah, how much do you need?"
Emily: How much is it?
Murph: I have 900 credits left.
Siobhan: I have 3.500 credits.
Lou: I have 3.000.
Brennan: There's the best stuff available here is gonna give disadvantage on stealth.
Emily: Do we go for it with Aurora?
Siobhan: I think so.
"Ally: Yeah, definitely, get her-"
"Lou: Yeah, I think if we already have people going disadvantage."
Emily: With a disadvantage.
Siobhan: Is there a way to get my drones' AC up as well?
"Brennan: Yes. So they have a suit of armor here that, with that 20% markup, that'll be 3.000 altogether for composite armor."
Emily: And what does that add to her AC?
Brennan: AC 15 plus two from Aurora's dex. So that would give-
Murph: 17.
Emily: 17? That would take her from 12 to 17.
Murph: That's what I'm wearing.
Emily: Okay.
Lou: How much do you need?
Siobhan: How much is it?
"Emily: 3.000, you said?"
Brennan: 3.000 altogether.
"Emily: 3.000, okay. You got it."
Siobhan: All right from me.
"Murph: I have not bought a single thing this entire campaign, and I just spent 7.000 credits."
"Ally: Last night, I had dinner with my girlfriend and then I looked at my phone and it said 80 missed messages from our text chain. So we absolutely figured this shit out ahead of time."
"Emily: And you said, ""Babe, I really need to do this."""
Brennan: Okay.
"Ally: I said, ""Babe, I gotta go. It was great to see ya."""
"Brennan: You guys do all of that in about like, you know, 45 maltrons so you gotta get to the Andalusian."
Murph: Sweet.
Siobhan: Let's do it.
"Ally: Oh, God."
"Brennan: So you guys roll up to the Andalusian, you're covered in gear. You walk by. As you're going through the hotel, everyone give me perception checks."
Siobhan: 13.
Murph: Nine.
Zac: 23.
Ally: 13.
Emily: Dirty 20.
Brennan: Dirty 20.
Lou: 16.
"Brennan: As you're going through, Skip, you look over and see this beautiful pool, lots of people- it's exciting. It's just weird to see a pool, 'cause it is nighttime now, even artificially, but you're like going through and you look out, see people really excited. People in the casino are whispering like,"
"Crowd: Oh, that's new Acme-Ashmun people."
"Brennan: As you guys start to go through, you see a group of bikini-clad, partially like terrycloth robed women enjoying like a lovely, there's like a fruit table out there. It looks like they're getting waited on hand and foot. One of them goes like,"
"Woman: Sadie Zeb, did you get your Bellini?"
"Brennan: And she looks and says,"
"Sadie Zeb: No, but I'll tell you what, sister, all good things come to she who waits and waits and waits and waits."
"Brennan: And there's a big laugh that goes up from all of them. As you move through the pool, they all look done up, like some of them are wearing like opulent jewelry, even in like swimsuits."
Emily: Are they one of the teams that we're gonna fight?
"Brennan: You go through, and I'm gonna say you get away from there into your locker room before, on that 23 perception check, there were 12 of them."
Siobhan: 12 of them?
Zac: The cloistered nuns that I supposedly...
(Zac laughing)
Brennan: “All things come to she who waits and waits and waits” is one of the teachings of the Cosmic Veil.
(retro music)
Murph: All right.
Zac: So they're not dead?
"Brennan: You get to your- you put that together in your head, you-"
Siobhan: They're just in Vegas? God damn it.
(Brennan laughs)
Zac: Or they're babes?
Murph: Or they're fighting us.
Ally: Oh my God.
Lou: And they're absolute babes!
Siobhan: They're absolute smokin' hot babes!
Brennan: 12 nuns are absolute smoke shows!
(group gurgling)
Zac: She didn't get her Bellini yet?
"Brennan: You guys get into the locker room. You have, yes, but you do realize that as you get to the locker room. Do you say anything?"
"Zac: I whisper that I,"
"Skip: Huddle up, huddle up, huddle up."
Gunnie: Yeah.
"Skip: You know those nuns that are supposed to be dead that I supposedly killed, or, you know, Skipper did?"
"Barry Syx: Right on, right on?"
Skip: They're over there having a bikini party.
(group laughing)
Gunnie: Those absolute babes?
Sid: But they were so hot.
Gunnie: They're supposed to be dead.
"Skip: They're just terry clothed, which makes sense, kind of."
Gunnie: Yeah.
Skip: But I think they're just hiding out here.
Sid: Should we go talk to them?
"Skip: Maybe we, do wanna wait until after, hopefully?"
Barry Syx: After we win and we have a-
Gunnie: If we're hot exiting-
Skip: Yeah.
"Sid: Yeah, we're definitely gonna run."
"Skip: I can't wait to go over there, once we have a million credits, and say, ""You're not even dead and I have a million credits."""
(group laughing)
Gunnie: It's gonna be so cool.
Riva: It's gonna be really cool.
(dance music)
"Brennan: Incredible. So you guys are in the locker room. You have all of your gear, you're suited up. You see-"
(mechanical whirring)
"Siobhan: Can I hook my extra drones onto the people, maybe Gunnie and then the two people that have jet packs?"
"Brennan: Okay, you want, yeah, if you want your-"
Zac: Wait I have to carry around-
"Lou: Yeah, I'm not sure I can carry-"
"Brennan: Yeah, actually, where are, so your drones do fold up."
Siobhan: Uh-huh.
"Brennan: So theoretically, someone like Barry could probably have the spare drones on like-"
"Siobhan: Okay, great."
"Murph: Chewbacca, C3PO?"
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah."
"Riva: Maybe we should, well, it's too late to leave one in the ship. We'll take all three. We'll take all three extras."
"Lou: Yeah, well, we can leave one in the locker room."
Ally: Are we about to go out? Can we like huddle up right before we go out?
"Brennan: Yeah. You can huddle up right before, yeah."
Ally: I just wanna like-
Zac: Pray?
"Ally: I would've, (Ally laughing) I just wanna pray. I feel like in the ship, I printed out a photo. I like went back in the cameras and found a photo of everyone in like a particularly like nasty fight with the Captain."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Ally: And I was like,"
"Margaret: Everybody, I want you to look at this photo. This is where we were at. Okay, I was sad. It's not you, I'm sorry, it's just."
Barry Syx: Insane that we took a picture.
Margaret: We used to be fucking miserable.
(group laughing)
Sid: Yeah.
"Margaret: We just spent 40K credits on guns. We're about to get $1.000.000. We have come so fucking far, and you know what? We're scary."
Gunnie: Yeah.
"Margaret: We're fucking scary, look around."
Barry Syx: Scary as hell.
Margaret: Everyone's got a ponytail. That's fucking scary.
Emily: Whew.
"Ally: And so, I wanna do kind of like a motivating speech and sage advice at the same time."
Brennan: You may absolutely do both of these.
"Ally: Okay, so now when-"
Skip: Should I got talk to those nuns?
"Ally: Yeah. Well, when we go out there, everybody has 1d6 plus four temp HP, plus three to AC, and a plus eight to any intimidation roll you roll during this entire fight."
Emily: Eight to intimidation?
Murph: Repeat everything you just said.
"Ally: Yeah, exactly."
Lou: You said it so fast.
"Ally: Okay, oh, yeah, lemme roll the d6. Okay."
Murph: Did you say plus three to AC?
Ally: Plus three to AC.
Lou: What is this?
Emily: What!
Ally: Now you have six temp HP. I only rolled a two.
"Zac: Oh- Ah, damn."
Brennan: Six temp HP to everybody.
Ally: Yeah.
"Emily: Does Aurora Nebbins get this, too?"
Brennan: Remember that temporary HP does not stack.
"Emily: Yeah, yeah, so I won't do this-"
"Murph: Oh, okay, so we don't need to do drugs."
Siobhan: Not yet.
"Lou: Some of us are gonna drink, but."
(group laughing)
Brennan: Incredible.
Siobhan: I'm also gonna cast battle precog on myself. So my base AC is 15.
Lou: Plus this possible three?
"Ally: Motivating diplomat: When you are the target of your critical analysis feature, your allies within 10 feet of you get a bonus-"
"Brennan: A bonus, okay."
"Ally: To their AC, okay. So we have to be within 10 feet, so sorry, yeah, yeah."
Brennan: And that means that you're putting your critical analysis on yourself.
Ally: Yes.
"Brennan: So you have your critical analysis on yourself. Within 10 feet of Margaret, you have plus three to your armor class."
"Ally: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. It's not that crazy."
"Murph: And I am going to, before the fight, I'm going to shield up with the heavy shield generator and then a revolver in the other hand."
"Ally: Yeah, shield up with the heavy shield generator as well."
"Sid: And I'm going to, right before we go on, I'm going to manifest my explosives mastery for the first time. And then I'm also going to cast mirror image, so a couple more Sundry Sidneys come out. And I'll also cast motivator boost on myself, because mirror image is not, is not concentration."
"Brennan: Yeah, do all this now."
Lou: I'm gonna ask for Sid's permission. I would like to affix five sentry turrets to Aurora Nebbins.
(Ally laughing)
Lou: If you'll allow it.
Siobhan: Hell yeah.
Emily: Absolutely.
"Sid: Aurora, are you okay with some sentry?"
(Brennan grunting)
Sid: Okay.
(Emily laughing)
Ally: Is this so that she can fly?
"Lou: No, these will be five sentry turrets that if anyone comes within 10 feet of her, they'll shoot on, or she comes within 10 feet of them, the turrets will shoot on them. So I just put these five globes, just kind of stick them in between the quills."
Ally: Oh my God.
Lou: Like two on each side.
Murph: Should you put those on me?
"Lou: I could put one on you. Do you wanna wear one? I don't know how big. It says they're the size- they adhere to any surface. As an action or bonus action, you can throw a sentry at a point you see within range."
Brennan: Give me a mechanics kit check.
(Ally laughing)
Murph: And how close do people need to be for that to?
Lou: 10 Feet.
Murph: Okay.
Lou: That's a… 18.
"Brennan: 18, okay. You can affix two to Aurora Nebbins before the amount of space- like she counts as like a 10 foot square."
"Lou: Great, so-"
Murph: Can you put one on me?
"Lou: I put one on Barry,"
(group laughing)
two on Aurora Nebbins.
"Emily: And like I said before, when I was saying I put fridge magnets on Riva's drone body, that was a charge fragmentation."
Brennan: All right.
Lou: And I'll put one on your drone body.
Brennan: Amazing.
"Ally: Oh, my bad. So it's plus three to intimidation plus eight the first time you use it."
Emily: Okay.
"Ally: So yeah, yeah, yeah."
Brennan: Copy.
"Ally: Well, also, I might be doing some swirly stuff with my critical analysis, 'cause I have two reactions per turn."
"Brennan: Yes, yes, yes, yes."
"Ally: And I took a feat that allows me as a, if someone is making a saving throw, I can use a reaction to put my critical analysis on them."
Brennan: Cool.
Zac: Did I get the-
"Lou: Yes, I've infused your weapon. So your crystal dagger is a plus one to attack."
"Zac: Oh, my blaster pistol, if I could?"
"Lou: Oh, blaster, is that what you wanna do?"
Zac: Yeah.
Lou: That's a plus one to attack and damage.
"Brennan: Lot of, (mechanical whirring) (clicking) suited up, and you see that Ross-"
Lou: I will cast sabotage charges. That's the last one.
"Brennan: Okay, you guys head out-"
"Lou: Wait, real quick?"
Brennan: Yes?
Lou: I'm so sorry.
Brennan: It's good.
Lou: So this is when we want to do everything we're doing right before?
Brennan: Yep.
Lou: Okay.
(Zac zipping)
I think Gunnie's gonna hit the Runalunian absynthe real quick.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: I'm gonna go into- I'm waiting like until we step in and it's about to be go time.
Brennan: Yeah.
Murph: For it to be zone time.
Brennan: Zone time.
Ally: I also drink absynthe.
Lou: I think that's gonna be my drug consumption.
Brennan: Cool.
"Lou: Well, I'm gonna walk out drinking Runalunian vodka."
"Murph: Oh, if things get really bad, can somebody give me some, can I have some Kublacaine?"
"Emily: Yeah, I pass out the Kublacaine-"
Murph: Sweet.
"Emily: So that as an action, if things are going bad."
Murph: I'm not gonna take it right now 'cause I don't.
Emily: I have it on me.
"Brennan: The Kublacaine, doesn't it- does it redo every turn?"
"Emily: At the start of each creature's turn, it gains 2d4 temporary hit points. At the end of the high, the creature must succeed a DC 14 wisdom saving throw or experience a low-"
Murph: Jesus Christ.
"Emily: that lasts 10 minutes, during which they must roll a d4 and subtract the result when making an ability check or saving throw using constitution, and for the duration, their current maximum hit points are reduced by 2d4."
"Murph: Sweet, I'll do some Kublacaine."
"Siobhan: Oh, yeah. Can I message Zortch on the ship and say,"
Riva: Zortch?
Brennan: We cut to the ship. Zortch just starts sprinkling like a pepper shaker of Kublacaine-
Ally: Like fish food.
"Brennan: So when you take Kublacaine, by the way, I do need to say, when this happens,"
(group laughing)
"the way it feels, an ego enhancing drug that takes hold of a normal or hyper normal ego foundering in the umbra of rational thought, id-ridden, fumbling and unaware of it or itself and transforms it into a forged, titanium fortress housing a crystalline consciousness just dripping with highlights and bristling with juicily dangerous sharp edges. Upon consumption of the drug, the consumer remains calm outwardly while within burgeons a much larger and oh so very calmer calm, a waveless calm, a serene, reposeful, Halcyonian calm, a calm based on the sudden and irrefutable knowledge that one is really quite a nice guy, no, a great guy, a prince, in fact, nay a Lord, a great Lord, stark and terrible, whose name or intimation of one's name conjures overall and solemn veneration in each mere and mortal consciousness within the vast breadth of one's omniscient gaze. Faint hearts quail. All bow, nay, genuflect before the all-knowing, all-seeing, all-being Being."
"Siobhan: Amen, brother."
"Ally: Yeah, Amen, Cody. Amen. Amen, Brad."
"Lou: So are we all just like sitting there, like quietly inside, going crazy?"
"Emily: Oh, no, I think I'm like pumping my chest with my gun."
"Brennan: You are each fully possessed of the knowledge that you are the central being at the core of the multiverse, and this is the realization of your grand destiny made manifest through your beneficent, multitudinous self."
Ally: I didn't do Kublacaine.
(group laughing)
I'm just drinking the tech points vodka.
Brennan: Yeah.
"Sid: Margaret, call Auma. Call Auma, tell her to watch."
(group laughing)
"Ally: I will. I send Auma a text that's like, maybe check this out, with a link."
"Gunnie: Hey guys, whatever happens out there, just don't forget, the ball's not rolling up anymore. We are the ball,"
(group laughing)
and we're going straight up.
Barry Syx: We are the ball.
"Margaret: Yeah, we are the ball!"
Gunnie: We are the ball.
"Brennan: I cannot believe it. I can't believe how far we as a table have come, from Kristen's inspiring speeches to Margaret's sage advice. It's beautiful. So, now you are escorted out of the locker room. They walk you. You hear,"
"Announcer: Welcome, one and all, to Fight Night here at the Kubla-Cola Gladiatorial Arena. Presenting your master of ceremonies, Zeke Donaldson Quark!"
"Brennan: Crowd erupts. You see, wearing a neon suit made of light, with this like wild like sort of plume of like troll doll hair. You see smiling, like metallic eyeshadow and lipstick. This sort of beautiful television presenter, announcer."
"Zeke Donaldson Quark: Hello, friends of Fight Night. It's the Battle of the Brands."
(cheering)
"Brennan: It goes nuts. You can't see them, but announcing over the channels, you see the Rec Station News box and you can hear some announcement of,"
"Jimmy The Snout: Good evening and welcome to Battle of the Brands. It's Jimmy The Snout, Rec Station News Ferret, here with Chip Hatwell, providing commentary live!"
"Chip Hatwell: Hey, gang, it's Chip Hatwell. Happy to be here."
"Brennan: And the crowd going nuts. You are moved to a dais. As the platform moves out in the center the arena, roaring crowds of people and billions of viewers at home all across the galaxy, and also, immediately, all of your enemies see you here-"
"Siobhan: Oh, no."
"Brennan: At the Battle the Brands in Mas Vegas, Lavada."
"Emily: Can we have each done, like, just like one little clip that they play when they do it like a package, just so I can be like,"
"Sid: Eat your heart out, Warfare Whitney."
(group laughing)
"Jimmy: Oh, wow. Absolute brand slander outta the gate from Sundry Sidney, the gunner, one of the two gunners here."
"Brennan: You see Zeke Donaldson,"
"Zeke: In this corner, challenger announced two Marbecs ago, representing the Acme-Ashmun brand, Acme-Ashmun, when you need the very best, here we have, straight from the heart of the galaxy, you might have seen them on Newscast from Rec 97, give it up for The Gunner Channel!"
Players: Woo!
Ally: Can we make intimidation checks?
"Lou: Yeah, can I do a flip? Can I do like a jetpack-y..."
Zac: I'm gonna save my intimidation check for-
Brennan: I'm gonna say this-
"Ally: Oh, yeah, 'cause we only get a bonus to the first."
"Brennan: Give me a group, I guess, performance check."
Siobhan: Great.
Emily: Okay.
"Lou: Guys, look at us. Look at us up there. Oh, look at us."
Emily: Oh my goodness.
Lou: God damn.
Siobhan: Can I do an insight check on the crowd?
Brennan: Sure.
Siobhan: So I can get advantage on this.
Emily: I got a 22.
"Brennan: 22, yeah."
Ally: 17.
Lou: 14.
"Brennan: 14, 17, cool."
"Murph: One. Cool, 22, one."
Emily: 22.
Zac: 11.
Brennan: 11. Barry's just in it.
"Murph: I think Barry's just making his own crowd sound, so it seems super weird. He's like,"
(group laughing)
Barry Syx: Hah! Ah!
Siobhan: What is that guy doing?
"Zeke: All right, Barry, you don't have to do that here. There's a real crowd!"
Barry Syx: (chanting) Barry! Barry!
(Emily laughing)
Barry!
"Brennan: Um, you guys see-"
Emily: I put his sunglasses over his mouth so no one can see.
"Brennan: Up in a sky box, you guys see a group of Acme-Ashmun executives who you realize, that's your real audience here."
Siobhan: Great.
Emily: Ooh.
"Brennan: That's who you're performing for. Zeke Donaldson Quark says,"
"Zeke: And in this corner, weighing in cumulatively at 280 pounds, you know them, you love them, you see them every Saturday morning, straight from the fuzzy, little forest at the heart of Uncle Bob's Fantanimal Land, It's Smaggy Squirrel and Brobbin Bunny!"
Siobhan: Boo!
(group booing)
(crowd cheering)
Siobhan: We hate that squirrel!
Ally: Where are they?
Emily: We have to fight a frigging squirrel?
Siobhan: Their thighs are so thick.
Ally: Their thighs are good.
Zac: Why does that bunny have a chain?
"Zeke: And in this corner, weighing in at 2.240 pounds straight from Amercadia, the Kansas Construct, representing Kansas Korncakes. You know him, you love him. It's time to get good and hungry for Brutus!"
Brennan: A 20 foot tall corn android
Ally: Awh.
Brennan: Wielding two-
Ally: So cute!
Murph: His quads are enormous.
Siobhan: His quads are so big. All of these guys have thighs for days.
Zac: Oh my God.
Lou: That's the scariest thing I've ever seen.
"Brennan: You can notice the corn is a costume, and you can see the android eyes looking at- the corn is just foam."
Emily: It's a Vercadian.
"Brennan: It's a Vercadian, yeah, absolutely."
Emily: Oh!
"Siobhan: Oh, wow."
Zac: That is a corn cutie.
"Brennan: The room goes quiet and you hear like that sort of like, the synth music plays, like (Brennan scatting). Laser show starts."
"Zeke: And last Rigon's champion, crowd favorite,"
"Brennan: everyone in the crowd starts chanting,"
"(low, indistinct chanting)"
"and you can't quite make out the word. They say,"
"Zeke: Representing Triangle Mint Cookies, the pride of the Galactic Girl Guides and the Galaxy's favorite snack, recovered from the heart of a planetary weapons array, lodged in the heart of a dying star, you know it, give it up for the Triangle Mint Plinth!"
Brennan: And you see everyone's shouting.
Crowd: Plinth! Plinth! Plinth! Plinth!
"Brennan: A glittering, obsidian obelisk,"
(group laughing)
that appears to be a telekinetic slab of alien stone.
(group laughing)
"Murph: Barry thinks they're chanting ""Syx""."
Barry Syx: Syx! Syx! Syx! Syx!
"Zeke: Oh, we're not-"
"Gunnie: No, Barry, they're for the black thing."
Barry Syx: Syx! Syx!
"Sid: It might the drugs, but it's, you know, working on him."
"Brennan: You guys see the crowd go nuts when Plinth shows up. And you see someone that goes like,"
"Person in Crowd: You get 'em, Plinth! We love Plinth!"
Brennan: Plinth just hovers there. You can feel waves of psychic radiation. You feel like you're being irradiated by the mere presence of the Plinth on the fight dais.
Siobhan: Great. Perfect.
Ally: Okay.
"Zeke: Without further ado, give it up for our champions. No rules, just right, here at Fight Night at the Kubla-Cola Gladiatorial Arena. Put your hands together and let round one begin! Fight! Everybody roll initiative."
Siobhan: Oh my God.
Emily: Oh!
Ally: Are we just fighting on this thing?
Zac: Is there not another team? I thought there were five teams.
"Emily: I got a nat one, but I'm re-rolling it."
"Ally: Oh my God, nice."
Zac: Yes.
Murph: 11.
Emily: I also got an 11.
Siobhan: I got a 14.
Zac: 20.
Ally: Nat one.
"Brennan: Nat one? Gunnie, what did you get?"
Lou: 13.
"Brennan: Okay, the fight begins. We enter initiative and Aurora is gonna go with Sid. So Sid and Aurora are gonna act on the same initiative. Skip?"
Zac: Yeah.
Brennan: You are first to act.
"Zac: So prior to my turn, I also get to move with bad feeling."
Brennan: That's correct.
"Zac: I'm gonna look around and see like, what is fair game in this arena? Like what are these big posts in the corner? Like could I get on one of those things?"
Brennan: You see that those are like camera stations.
"Zac: Okay, so that is outta bounds."
"Brennan: Those camera stations are out of bounds, correct."
Zac: Okay.
Emily: Like out of bounds? They did say no rules in the beginning.
Murph: That's true.
Siobhan: They did say no rules.
Brennan: They did say no rules.
Zac: But it's out of bounds?
"Brennan: Well, yeah, it looks like it is out of bounds. Correct."
Emily: Okay.
"Zac: I'm sorry to say this, but it's out of bounds, but there are also no rules, right? So I do wanna jump on one of those camera nests."
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: Okay, go for it."
Zac: Is that okay?
"Brennan: Yeah. Go for it, go for it."
Zac: And hide up there with Marge.
"Brennan: You grab Marge, you scoot up, you're flying. You're in one of those nests there."
"Zac: I'm gonna go up there and then, well, yeah, take that attack with my blaster pistol on the Plinth."
Brennan: Hell yes.
Murph: Oh my God.
Emily: You might as well see what it's made of.
Ally: Get some info.
"Lou: Yeah, let's get data."
"Zac: Fuck it, I'm attacking the Plinth."
(group laughing)
Brennan: Here we go. And you're within range from where you are to hit the Plinth with a blaster?
"Zac: Yeah, it's like 40 something feet, it looks like."
"Brennan: Cool. Yeah, go ahead and make your attack."
"Zac: I hate that tone. So that would be, I have advantage because they haven't gone yet. Higher one is 16, but with the supreme accuracy, I'm gonna also roll again. Yeah, 16 on the die plus, with that, I have a plus nine to hit. So it's a 25."
"Brennan: I'm gonna go ahead and say, cool, yeah, you definitely have it. You can, on your flight up, get a totally clear shot on Plinth. A 25 does hit. You immediately take four points of damage. As you fire at it, you feel reverberating from it a pure, alien, psychic hatred of crystalline consciousness and blood vessels in your nose burst as your brain is scrambled. Four points of damage. Go ahead and take your attack."
"Lou: So, that was one of Plinth's legendary reactions?"
Murph: Or Plinth just does damage every time we-
"Siobhan: Just goes every time we hit him, I think."
Emily: Yeah.
Zac: 17 plus six is 23 damage.
Brennan: 23 damage to Plinth.
Ally: I'm going to targeted strike where I add a superiority die to that.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: And so that's with an additional six.
"Brennan: Plinth takes 29 points of damage, which you can tell bypasses a hefty damage threshold."
Siobhan: Okay.
Emily: Ooh.
"Zac: And then bonus action, hide."
(Zac laughing)
"Brennan: Hell yeah, give me a stealth check."
Zac: We're just gonna hope. That is a... 26.
"Brennan: Incredible. 26 stealth okay, that's gonna be Smaggy Squirrel and Brobbin Bunny. Okay."
Murph: Focus on the Plinth.
"Gunnie: Together, we can destroy Plinth!"
Brennan: Brobbin Bunny is gonna rush Aurora Nebbins and Smaggy Squirrel is gonna rush Sundry Sidney. They're going for the closest ones.
Emily: Okay.
Murph: I look up at the corn guy.
Barry Syx: I want you in the finals.
(group laughing)
Me and you.
Ally: Oh my fucking God.
"Brennan: Okay, that's a hit against Aurora Nebbins."
Emily: Okay.
Zac: I'm so scared.
Siobhan: I know.
Lou: I'm terrified.
Ally: Me too.
Lou: I just don't want Plinth to go.
"Siobhan: I know, I'm terrified of Plinth."
"Zac: Why did I, ugh, I just truly forgot to use one of my basic abilities in that turn."
"Brennan: 23, 33 points of damage to Aurora Nebbins as Brobbin Bunny says, I think you should take a nap! And against you, definitely gonna be a hit. Go ahead and roll to see if it gets one of your mirror images."
Emily: Can I just shield?
"Brennan: Each time the creature targets you with an attack during the power's duration, roll a D20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates."
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: So shield-
"Emily: So, it doesn't matter."
"Murph: See if that happens first, and then shield would happen after?"
Brennan: Yeah.
Emily: I got a 10.
"Brennan: They hit one of your duplicates, d10 plus your dex mod, so one duplicate destroyed."
"Emily: Bye, Sid."
Brennan: Coming at you with another attack. Hits again. Roll to see if it hits another duplicate.
Emily: 12.
"Brennan: Okay. So two of your duplicates, as Smaggy Squirrel says,"
(Brennan squealing)
and both of them go
(Brennan laughing)
"and leap straight up into like these swirling cones, swirling cylinders above you."
Emily: Wouldn't I get an opportunity attack?
Brennan: They're going to bonus action disengage.
"Emily: Okay, okay."
Brennan: And both of them leap up the tall cylinders up above.
Lou: Terrifying.
Siobhan: Really awful.
(Brennan laughing)
Brennan: That is going to be Riva.
"Siobhan: Okay, it's failed twice, but this is the fight where it'll work, I swear to God. I'm going to cast psychic confusion on the corn cutie, and I'm gonna do it with heightened spell so that they have disadvantage on their wisdom saving throw."
Murph: Attacking everyone. Exactly.
Brennan: Okay. You're gonna use psychic confusion.
"Lou: He can't be that smart, he's a big corn thing."
Siobhan: Exactly.
"Brennan: Big, old corn thing."
Ally: He's just a protector droid.
Zac: The quads on that.
"Ally: They put all of it in like, you know, con."
"Lou: I mean, he was dumb enough to get in this stupid outfit."
Brennan: What is the save here?
Siobhan: DC 16.
"Brennan: Wisdom, right?"
Siobhan: At disadvantage.
"Murph: Nice. Ooh, this is great."
Brennan: Passes.
Murph: What?
"Siobhan: Well, good for him. In which case I will quicken, try and disarm one of these disgusting- The disgusting rabbit."
"Brennan: Hell, yes. Try to disarm the disgusting rabbit."
"Siobhan: And that's either strength or dex. DC 16, once again."
"Brennan: You see that the chain whips out and it wraps an arm around and says,"
"Brobbin Bunny: No, no, no. Mine! And pulls it back."
Siobhan: Great. I'm gonna move so I am behind Aurora Nebbins.
Brennan: Incredible.
Siobhan: Did nothing.
"Brennan: You move, rush behind Aurora Nebbins. That's Riva. Gunnie, that is you."
"Lou: Great, is there anyone, can- I mean, I don't know if I'm allowed to ask this. Is there anyone in the initiative order between me and Sid?"
Brennan: You are not allowed to ask that. You do not know.
Lou: Great. I'm not allowed to ask that. Okay. I want to-
"Murph: These bunnies drew first blood, Gunnie."
"Lou: So it's, we're on the-"
Murph: We're on the bunnies.
Emily: We're on the bunnies?
"Siobhan: Well, Skip bled out of his nose. He had a nosebleed."
Murph: I think the Plinth is unfeeling.
Lou: So the bunnies drew first blood.
(Murph laughing)
Murph: I feel like they're just gonna fucking attack us every time.
Lou: Great.
Zac: Yeah. Any way we can convince them to not?
"Lou: Can I do an intimidate check on the, on the rabbits? I mean, like,"
Gunnie: You don't want this!
(group laughing)
Gunnie: You don't want this!
Brennan: Give me an intimidate check.
Lou: And I get plus?
Ally: Eight.
Lou: Okay.
"Ally: First one, and you're sponsored, so this needs to work."
(group laughing)
Ally: No!
"Siobhan: Oh, come on."
Lou: It's a 17.
Gunnie: You don't want this!
Smaggy Squirrel: Want this?
Gunnie: You don't!
Smaggy Squirrel: Want it.
Gunnie: You don't want this!
Smaggy Squirrel: Want this! Okay.
Lou: Okay. It sounds like they do want this. I'm gonna fly back.
Gunnie: You don't want this.
Lou: I'm gonna hit the rabbit with an explosion.
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: Or can I hit a point between the two that they are both engulfed in a 20 foot radius?
"Brennan: Oh, they are definitely not 20 feet away from each other."
"Lou: Great, I would like to hit both of the two of them with an explosion."
Brennan: Cool.
Lou: They make DC 17 dexterity saving throws.
"Murph: Does it knock them down or anything, or just do a bunch of damage?"
Lou: Just does 8d6.
Murph: Cool.
Brennan: Go ahead and roll damage.
"Lou: Okay. Eight, 14, 22, 33 points of damage."
Brennan: 33 points of damage?
Siobhan: Nice.
"Brennan: Smaggy and Brobbin both leap up, doing insane double back flips in the air. Smaggy takes no damage. Brobbin takes half of that for 16 points of damage."
Lou: Great. Then I'm gonna throw two sabotage charges at them. So I need two more dexterity saving throws from them.
"Brennan: They both make their saves, take no damage."
"Lou: Oh, then I won't."
Zac: They don't take any damage?
"Siobhan: Oh, 'cause they, they're like high level rogues, they're like level 10 rogues."
Zac: Do they get to do that every time?
"Siobhan: No, they, it's that, yeah."
Lou: And I'm gonna use my last feet of movement to put the pillar in between me and anybody.
"Siobhan: Brennan, you're right, you made this unfair."
(Brennan laughing)
Brennan: Incredible.
Emily: I believe in us.
"Lou: I believe in us, as well."
Siobhan: I think this turn it might be go time.
Murph: I'm 100% going to kill one of the little guys.
Siobhan: I think this turn.
(Ally laughing)
Murph: Even if I die.
"Siobhan: If we kill one of the little guys, I'll be happy at this point."
Murph: Then we're fine.
Siobhan: I've just seen how bad this fight is for us. If we can-
"Lou: And then Aurora Nebbins is not within 10 feet of anyone, correct?"
Brennan: Within 10 feet of Riva and Sid.
Lou: Is Barry within 10 feet of the corn guy?
"Brennan: Brutus is within 10 feet of Barry, correct."
Murph: What are you?
Lou: The sentry on your back.
Murph: This is like going into the Royal Rumble and attacking Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock at the same time.
"Lou: Okay, okay. He has not been hostile to us yet, so it doesn't have to attack him yet."
Brennan: Oh.
"Ally: Can this be public? Can they shout like, ""Attack the corn person"" ""No, he hasn't done anything yet."""
Barry Syx: No! Me and the corn guy are going to the finals.
(group laughing)
"Brennan: Give me, honestly, give me a persuasion with advantage."
(group laughing)
Murph: Can I use the intimidation? Less as-
Brennan: I will say yes.
"Murph: But more of just like, we're both so strong!"
(group laughing)
"Brennan: Go for it, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Murph: Nat 20.
Ally: Yay!
Emily: Woo!
(group clapping)
Ally: No way!
Emily: Yes!
Siobhan: Yes!
Emily: Woo!
Lou: Yes!
"Emily: Yes, baby!"
"Brennan: On a nat 20, you see Brutus looks at you and says,"
"Brutus: Eat Korncake, make you big and strong,"
Brennan: and headbutts you. He's not going to attack Barry.
(Murph laughing)
I'm gonna roll a d6.
"Barry Syx: If you kill a bunny, that's fine, do."
(Die clatters)
Brennan: Okay.
Siobhan: Bunnies eat corn. They're pests.
"Brennan: He is not gonna target Barry with this, but he's gonna try to hit as many people with this as he can."
Siobhan: Oh my God.
(Ally laughing)
Brennan: So we start here.
"Brennan: No, my team!"
"Ally: Oh my God. There's also just like dynamic lighting, like from a candle, so his thighs."
Brennan: His thighs!
Ally: His thighs are glowing.
"Lou: Where there's shading on his thighs, you really get-"
"Ally: Oh my God, is that a birthmark? Honey, what happened to your thigh, baby? Who hurt you?"
(group laughing)
"Lou: Baby, who hurt you?"
"Emily: Baby, who hurt you?"
"Ally: Baby, who hurt you?"
"Brennan: On that nat 20 intimidation, Brutus is going to move to right next to the Plinth."
Murph: Oh my God.
Brennan: And he is going to hit
(dramatic music)
"both Smaggy, Brobbin, the Plinth, but also Sid, Aurora Nebbins and Riva."
Murph: Makes sense.
Emily: Okay.
Siobhan: Is this a save or is this an attack?
Brennan: This is a save.
Siobhan: What kind of save?
Brennan: A constitution-
Emily: Add your d4.
Brennan: Saving throw.
"Siobhan: Add a d4, great. I did do drugs."
Lou: Add a d4 if you did drugs.
Emily: Let me see what I get on the d4 first.
"Lou: Oh, yeah, does the uncanny dodge, does that cost something?"
"Siobhan: I got a 16, which is probably not high enough."
"Ally: Okay, I'll help you."
Emily: I got an 11.
Siobhan: You should help Sid.
"Emily: Well, you might be able to save."
Siobhan: Right.
"Ally: I just add five to it, like a flat five."
"Siobhan: Oh, okay."
Ally: So that would-
Siobhan: That's very helpful.
Ally: You would be 21.
"Emily: Yeah, I think you should go for Riva."
"Siobhan: I might be immediately down, 'cause I only have 32 hit points."
(dice shaking menacingly)
(dice clatter)
"Brennan: Okay. He goes,"
Brutus: See you in the final.
"Brennan: 55 points of damage to Riva, Sid-"
Ally: Can it be halved?
Brennan: And Aurora Nebbins.
Ally: At 21?
Brennan: You got a 21?
Ally: Yeah.
Brennan: Halved.
Emily: I'm down. I think.
"Brennan: Sid is down. Halved, 55 is halved to 27."
"Siobhan: 27, great. Thank God for those temp hit points."
Brennan: What'd Aurora Nebbins get for the save?
"Emily: Oh, Aurora Nebbins is definitely gonna be down, though, even with half, yeah. Aurora Nebbins is also down."
"Brennan: You see, and now I'm gonna roll some saves for our other little friends here."
"Ally: Do we see the, or, whatever. Yeah, we can't really see his face. I wanted to know if the corn immediately got hurt, too."
"Brennan: You guys see, however, on that nat 20, getting him away from trying to hit you, he does also target Smaggy and Brobbin. They each take the full 55-"
Murph: Jesus Christ.
"Brennan: As Brutus goes,"
(Brennan roaring)
"and just a cone of horrifying, gaseous venom erupts from his mouth."
Brutus: Eat Korncakes!
"Brennan: Plinth is completely immune to poison damage, takes nothing."
Murph: Jesus Christ.
Siobhan: Oh my God. Oh my God.
"Brennan: And Riva, you are not down, correct?"
Siobhan: I am not down. I have five hit points.
(Brennan roaring)
"Brennan: You see,"
"Zeke: Well, that's an incredible venom breath from Brutus here. We love to see the action out here tonight. This android has it all!"
(crowd cheering)
"Brennan: And after that, Barry, that is gonna be your turn."
"Murph: Sweet. I am going to action, med pack my fellow gunner, Sid."
Ally: Hell yeah.
Emily: Ooh!
"Murph: So go ahead and roll a hit dice, plus your con, and then my temp hit dice are gonna change."
Lou: This is crazy.
Murph: So I go from being-
Siobhan: This is crazy. This is crazy.
Emily: I can do this. Put me fucking back in.
"Siobhan: If we take out one of these people, we've done really, really well."
Murph: So I go from 76 back down to 69.
Siobhan: Nice.
Murph: And then back up to 74. And then that is my action. I'm gonna go ahead and I'll just get up on the highest point that I can get with the 30 feet.
"Brennan: As you say that to Brutus, he goes over there, you run, do the pack, get Sid back up and leap straight up. As you do, all these little robots flying around all spotlight on you with that nat 20. You hear Jimmy The Snout go,"
"Jimmy: Uh-oh, looks like some mid-combat med packing here"
(group laughing as Murph puts on sunglasses)
from Big Barry Syx.
(group clapping)
"Straight up in the air. I've never seen air on a heavy like that! This guy's got weight, but he can move."
Ally: Oh my God. You absolutely have some like snus.
"Brennan: Margaret, you haven't gone in combat yet. You look up, see Barry do that and see one of the older Acme-Ashmun executives look up from their phone for the first time."
Ally: We did it.
Emily: Ooh!
Ally: We're getting signed to Reign.
(group laughing)
"Brennan: Inside baseball, folks."
Siobhan: It's a joke just for us.
"Brennan: Okay, amazing. At the end of your turn, Brutus, I'm gonna take a legendary action, and again, off that nat 20, swats at the Plinth."
Zac: Yes!
(group shouting)
(Brennan laughing)
Siobhan: We stan!
Emily: Yes!
Siobhan: Thighs of steel!
"Murph: Oh my God, Brutus."
Brennan: Hits it for 10 points of damage. Brutus immediately takes four as a blood vessel bursts in his nose.
"Jimmy: Wow, you can see Brutus really feeling the hatred of the Plinth! We don't know what ancient alien civilization built Plinth, but we know they did not like living organisms."
(Emily laughing)
"Ally: Wait, did the Plinth take 10 points of damage? So that was maybe like a damage threshold?"
"Brennan: Well information for you, 10 points of damage, the Plinth does not take 10 points of damage. 10 does not bypass the damage threshold."
"Siobhan: All right, okay."
"Zac: Oh, damn."
"Brennan: So Plinth still only injured by Skip's attack. You see there's a little crack there from where Skip shot Plinth. Getting sneak attack on a flat stone slab is completely bonkers, but you found the weak point. That's legendary action. Save, and Plinth saves against the effect that Brutus would've done there in a legendary action. Sid-"
Emily: okay.
"Brennan: You are back up. Also, give me a death save for Aurora Nebbins."
(Emily grunting)
Murph: That's cruel.
"Emily: Come on, baby. Nat 20!"
(Murph laughing)
Siobhan: Shut the fuck up! Yes!
Emily: Nat 20! Nat fucking 20!
"Zac: Get outta here, get outta here!"
(group cheering)
Siobhan: Kiss it!
Emily: Woo!
"Brennan: Barry, you med pack, leap straight up. Sid, as you leap back up-"
Siobhan: Amazing.
Ally: That's so sick.
"Brennan: By the way, I will say, too, you lost your concentration, but mirror image, I'm gonna rule, you still have one duplicate left because it's not a concentration. I don't think it ends. And you feel next to you as you get back up, you hear,"
(Brennan grunting)
"and feeling your hand moving, Aurora,"
(Brennan snarls)
"with one hit point, full like Mononoke wolf, like got some blood oozing between her razor sharp teeth."
(Brennan grunting)
"Sid: Get him, baby."
Brennan: Both you and Aurora get turns.
"Emily: Ooh, okay!"
Brennan: She's back up at one at the start of her turn.
Murph: No one make the corn guy mad.
Zac: Can you get safe? Can you go somewhere like where you can basically-
"Emily: Yeah. So, that's what I'm gonna do."
"Siobhan: Yeah, I would just get safe."
(Lou laughing)
I would just get safe.
"Emily: So I'm gonna cast, using my action to cast motivator boost on myself to double my speed."
"Brennan: Cool. So with the rocket boots, you're going 60."
"Emily: Yeah. So I'm using my speed to get to one of these camera places. From there, are these guys within a 10 foot radius?"
Brennan: Smaggy Squirrel and Brobbin Bunny?
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: I do not believe they are within 10 feet of each other.
Emily: Okay. Then I will throw a stun grenade at each.
"Brennan: Okay, they're gonna make constitution saving throws here."
"Ally: Come on, baby."
Brennan: The DC is 16 because you have your ideal manifested.
Emily: Yep.
"Brennan: Okay, stun is pretty fucking big deal."
Emily: Technically unconscious.
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: If they fail.
Ally: If they fail.
Emily: Which means auto crits on attacks.
Zac: Okay.
Emily: I'm assuming rogues don't usually stack up on con.
Brennan: That kind of system knowledge can get you a long way in this game.
(group laughing)
"We're bringing out the Box of Doom, folks."
(group laughing)
For the folks at home so that you-
"Ally: Fuck yes, Emily."
"Brennan: For you all to react at home, I'm gonna let you know what our highly dextrous Smaggy Squirrel and Brobbin Bunny add to their constitution saving throw. This is what they add."
(Brennan holds up 3 fingers in the box of doom)
"Here we go, let's roll these saves. They're trying to beat a DC 16. Meet or beat 16."
(suspenseful music)
(rolls a 4 and a 13)
"Two stun grenades. Boom, boom! At the last second, Smaggy covers her eyes and goes, Brobbin, watch out! Brobbin goes, huh? Boom! And Brobbin goes prone on the top of the Plinth. Brobbin Bunny is stunned. Smaggy makes her save."
"Emily: Okay. So I have moved my character to hide in one of these things, and now Aurora Nebbins is gonna go after the stunned one."
Brennan: Give me an acrobatics check for Aurora Nebbins.
Emily: Okay.
Murph: And are you going to a different camera thing than these guys?
Zac: I think we should be on a different one.
"Ally: Yeah, definitely. Absolutely."
"Murph: Definitely, 'cause these area effects are devastating."
Emily: It's a nine.
"Brennan: It's difficult terrain, but she is gonna use a bonus action from-"
"Emily: Yeah, she can, yeah."
Brennan: Give me one more acrobatics check. You just gotta beat at DC to get up to the Plinth and grab the bunny.
Emily: Okay. I got a 10.
Brennan: Got a 10 exactly!
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: So you, she looks up and goes, (Brennan grunting) it's like,"
"Jimmy: Uh-oh, looks like someone needs to tell that beautiful, royal blue mastiff that's not a real bunny! She doesn't seem to care, folks. She looks hungry."
(Brennan shouting)
"Brennan: She reaches up, she can go ahead and take attacks."
Emily: Can I just have her drag it off?
Murph: And throw it off the platform?
Emily: And throw it off the podium?
"Brennan: Oh, shit, just pick it up and throw the bunny off the platform?"
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see, she looks hungry. Do you give her the command? Yeah."
"Emily: Yeah. I say,"
"Sid: take out the trash, baby."
(Ally laughing)
Brennan: All the cameras zoom in on you.
(lasers blasting)
Go ahead and gimme a free performance with advantage here as well.
(group laughing)
"Emily: Okay, that's gonna be a… 21."
"Brennan: A 21. Take out the trash, baby."
"Jimmy: Uh-oh, looks like we got a little bit of sass here from our resident Sundry Sidney. Folks, she loves dogs and hates rabbits."
Brennan: You see Aurora Nebbins picks up and then looks at you and like wiggles her butt.
"Sid: And I say, let's play fetch."
(Brennan roaring)
"Brennan: You see, throws the bunny. The bunny sails off the side of of the dais."
Ally: Oh my God.
Brennan: And falls endlessly through space.
"Jimmy: Folks, now that's what I call a well-trained dog. You can tell Aurora Nebbins wanted to eat that bunny and eat that bunny bad!"
"Chip: Hey, you're not wrong, Jimmy. I have a dog and I can't stop him from attacking my neighbors."
(Emily laughing)
"Brennan: And you see, first enemy, Brobbin Bunny is off the field."
"Emily: Oh, I also have to roll my temp HP. Ugh, got an eight. But I also, I hide, so I'm hoping to get some kind of cover."
Brennan: It is Plinth's turn.
"Emily: 14, crap."
"Zac: Now, I've-"
Murph: What does Plinth-
"Zac: Hidden, hopefully, but..."
Brennan: First thing Plinth is gonna do is gonna make a perception check.
Lou: Okay.
"Zac: 26 on that hide, right?"
"Brennan: Plinth is going to gravitate, taking an attack of opportunity here. That is going to be 16 points of damage from Brutus swinging with a reaction, which does pass the damage threshold."
"Emily: Oh, it does, okay. Very good to know."
"Brennan: So 16 damage, he goes (grunts) crack, into the Plinth's side."
"Jimmy: Uh-oh, here comes the Triangle Mint Plinth. Plinth is never in a rush, and that's the kinda of technique you love to see from a completely inhuman obelisk, folks."
Lou: Does Brutus seem to bleed through his nose when he hits him?
"Brennan: He does. So another four points of damage to Brutus. TaleSpire, from the center of Plinth, can we measure a 30 foot radius sphere?"
(Zac laughing)
Lou: From the center of Plinth.
"Brennan: Who is outside of that sphere right now? Gunnie, are you outside of it?"
Lou: Mm-hmm.
Emily: I am.
"Brennan: So, Skip, Margaret, Gunnie and Sid are all out. Riva, Aurora Nebbins-"
Siobhan: God damn it.
"Brennan: And you, I am going to need wisdom saving throws-"
Murph: Damn it.
Brennan: From all of you.
"Siobhan: Okay, I do roll that with advantage."
Lou: Oh my God.
Siobhan: 25.
Murph: 12.
"Ally: Okay, defiant?"
"Zac: No, he doesn't have defiant."
"Ally: Heads up, actually, that's my version of defiant."
Emily: Seven for Aurora.
Murph: What does heads up do?
Emily: You get to add a d6. So I can a friendly creature you can see or hear makes a saving throw.
"Murph: I have a feeling this is gonna get me anyway, but let's try it. Why not? Do you wanna roll it? You roll better than me. A d6?"
"Ally: Yeah, wait, what are you at?"
"Murph: I'm at, what did I say, 12?"
(suspenseful music)
Ally: Five.
Murph: 17?
Brennan: 17 is not gonna do it.
Murph: Yeah.
Ally: Dammit. That's okay.
"Brennan: So Riva, you save against this successfully."
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: For Barry and Aurora, Plinth floats to the middle of the dais and-"
"(unnatural rumbling, roaring)"
"you see in your mind, the black hole at the center of this galaxy."
Siobhan: Oh God.
"Brennan: And you hear in a language, as you begin to understand the words of this language, your eardrums and nostrils fill with blood as Plinth says,"
Plinth: Return me to the dying heart.
"Brennan: And your speed is reduced to zero, you are under the frightened condition."
Murph: Dammit.
Brennan: As is Aurora Nebbins.
"Siobhan: Oh, I can help. I can help with that."
"Emily: Okay, I say to everyone, we need to get Barry outta there."
Murph: I'm fine. I think I'm just scared of-
"Emily: No, we need to get you out of there."
Murph: The Plinth.
"Siobhan: I actually got it, I can do it."
Emily: Okay.
Siobhan: This is- I have exactly the thing that can happen. And we can game time still in that.
Emily: Okay.
Siobhan: 'Cause that means I have a bonus action.
Emily: Great.
Siobhan: And then it's you.
Lou: We can still game time.
"Emily: Awesome, great."
Murph: No idea what game time is.
Ally: Operation slippery puppet.
(Siobhan laughing)
Emily: Operation slippery puppet.
Brennan: And then Plinth is going to move straight up to like underneath the Jumbotron.
Zac: Oh fuck.
Siobhan: Oh my God. God dammit.
Lou: He wants to get us all.
"Brennan: Oh, and I have to roll for Smaggy Squirrel as well."
"Emily: Yeah, I was gonna say, what happens to Smaggy Squirrel?"
"Brennan: Smaggy rolls, succeeds on her wisdom save. Moving along in the initiative order, that's gonna be Margaret."
"Ally: Okay, great. Um, I am going to..."
(Siobhan and Emily laughing)
I'm a polyglot. Can I try to speak to the Plinth?
Brennan: Sure. You wanna speak to Plinth?
"Ally: I just wanna say,"
Margaret: do you want to be fighting?
Brennan: Plinth (cosmic music) enters into the heart of your mind.
Ally: I welcome it.
"Brennan: You see it goes,"
Plinth: I want the all fight.
"Brennan: And you watch the explosion, implosion and ending of the universe in the consumption of ultimate entropy."
Jimmy: Looks like the Triangle Mint Plinth out there is having some kind of psychic conversation with Margaret Encino.
(Ally laughing)
"Ally: I blow a kiss to the Plinth that it can't see. And then I, I think I'm just going to throw a stun grenade at the bunny who's on the little thing. And my DC save is 14."
Emily: Stun the bun.
Brennan: Okay.
Ally: Stun the bun.
Lou: Stun the bun.
Siobhan: Stun the bun.
"Brennan: Here we go, actually this is, one- Stun is very, very bad. Here we go. Adding the same amount."
(rolls a 6)
(dramatic music)
"Margaret, you hurl that grenade."
"Ally: Yeah, I think I'm gonna throw it so hard and even hit it, and I'm like, ah, and it's like, so weak."
Brennan: You lean over and throw this. You are exactly within distance.
Ally: Woo!
Brennan: And Smaggy Squirrel is stunned.
Murph: Nice.
Emily: Yes!
Ally: So I lean over and I go...
(group laughing)
One of those awful throws.
Siobhan: So awful.
Ally: And then I'm gonna train my critical analysis on Barry.
Brennan: Cool.
Murph: Appreciate it.
Ally: So I don't have to use any of my reactions next round. And then I am going to hide.
(Ally laughing)
Is that a whole action?
Brennan: Hell yes.
"Emily: You can still get cover, though. You can use your movement to get cover."
"Ally: Love it. Yeah, I'll kind of scoot back a little bit in our little nest, to the very end."
"Brennan: Okay, you huddle back in. You're over there."
Emily: Can I roll to see if I think that the Plinth should meet Gnosis?
(Brennan laughing)
Siobhan: Yes.
Brennan: Yeah.
Siobhan: They would hit it off.
Murph: I think that Plinth wants to destroy-
Ally: It was pretty low.
Murph: Humanity.
Ally: It was pretty low.
(Emily laughing)
Brennan: I think- It's pretty low? You're like the Plinth is one more problem than I need. I don't need to figure out Plinth.
Ally: We're done with the Plinth. Thank you so much.
(Emily laughing)
Brennan: Okay.
"Ally: I wink at the corn, though. Can I do that? I don't know if they're looking at me, but I'm just like-"
"Lou: Hey, Corn."
Margaret: It's good to have you on the team.
Ally: And I flash a contract at the corn.
(Ally and Emily laughing)
Brennan: Okay.
Lou: Flash a contract?
"Ally: I go,"
Margaret: you could be signing this.
Lou: This stack? You want in on this stack of papers?
"Emily: I tell the corn,"
Sid: We all got a signing bonus.
(Ally laughing)
"Brennan: Plinth, at the end of Margaret's turn, is going to go for Margaret and Skip. I'm going to need-"
Zac: It can see us?
Brennan: It doesn't need to. I'm gonna need intelligence saving throws from both of you.
Lou: Jesus.
Zac: Yikes.
Emily: Ooh.
"Siobhan: Actually, they're both very smart."
Zac: Pretty smart.
Siobhan: So...
Emily: Come on.
Zac: It doesn't need to see us at all?
(suspenseful music)
Lou: What'd you roll?
Zac: 24.
Brennan: 24?
(suspenseful music)
"Siobhan: Come on, Margaret."
"Ally: It's a natural, so that's kind of cool."
Siobhan: Oh no.
Ally: Natural is all the rage these days.
Emily: No!
"Ally: No additives, 'cause it's just a one."
"Murph: Cool, cool."
Ally: We don't add anything to that.
Brennan: Okay.
"Ally: I could add a d4 to that, though, so that's kind of cool."
(suspenseful music)
Emily: That gave me a stomach ache.
Ally: This makes me-
Brennan: 10.
Ally: Upset.
Lou: How many hit points do you have?
Siobhan: 30.
Brennan: 29 points of damage to Margaret.
(Ally gasping)
Ally: Okay.
Zac: Are you alive?
Ally: Yeah.
Murph: 'Cause of the Kublacaine?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Brennan: 'Cause of the Kublacaine?
"Ally: I didn't do Kublacaine, just 'cause of the inspiring speech."
"Brennan: Okay, 29 points of damage to Margaret. That's gonna be 14 points of damage to Skip."
Zac: Uncanny dodge.
Brennan: This is unfortunately not an attack. It is a spell.
Zac: Okay.
(Ally laughing)
Ally: Okay!
"Brennan: You take 14 points of psychic damage. You spoke to Plinth, and Plinth goes into your mind and goes,"
Plint: Do you want to understand?
"Brennan: And you know that your eyes have Plinth burned into them. You see a dying sun with a black rectangle in front of it and it's all you can see, burned into the front of your vision."
(Siobhan laughing)
Plinth: Plinth is all.
Brennan: And you have a minus 1d6 to all of your rolls.
Ally: Okay.
"Brennan: Brutus, all by his lonesome down there, actually-"
Lou: Go for Plinth.
"Brennan: Is gonna take some legendary actions, sort of looking around."
Siobhan: That squirrel is fucking available.
"Emily: Yeah, the squirrel's stunned."
"Brennan: That's going to be back to the top of the order. Skip, that's you."
Zac: I like kind of don't care about the squirrel.
"Emily: Yeah, right? It's stunned right now, you're right."
Zac: So it was able to do that attack without seeing me. Am I still hidden?
Brennan: You are still hidden. It looks like it just knew psychically.
Zac: Okay.
"Brennan: Where, like, it didn't need to, it's not an attack, it was an area of effect."
"Zac: Okay, I am going to… pop up, sneak attack on the Plinth."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Hell-
"Murph: I think we need to separate, too-"
"Emily: Yeah, it's Plinth time!"
"Murph: Probably, if it can get to each-"
Zac: And I'm gonna move for sure.
Lou: I think I can explode both Plinth and the squirrel.
Brennan: Cool.
"Zac: Okay. 17, but then a supreme accuracy roll again, see if I crit. Nat 20!"
Ally: Yes!
(group cheering)
Murph: Yes!
Zac: Natural 20!
"Emily: Yes, yes, yes!"
Lou: We're walking away millionaires!
Siobhan: Millionaires!
"Lou: This is how millionaires fight. Om, nom, nom, nom. Ooh, it tastes good."
"Emily: Margaret's nat one is followed by six zeroes, baby."
Ally: All I see is Plinth.
(group laughing)
"Brennan: All right, that's a nat 20 on Plinth."
Zac: So this is eight d6.
Brennan: Oh my God. Okay.
Lou: 8d6 on Plinth?
"Zac: All right, you know, does anyone wanna send their kids to school?"
Lou: I'd love.
Emily: Yeah!
Siobhan: Absolutely.
Emily: I would love to send my kids to camp.
Siobhan: Here's some kids for you.
"Zac: All right. Oh, I'm gonna forego two of them, actually, to do a different thing."
"Murph: Oh, I know what you're doing."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: Cool.
Siobhan: Yes. Good idea.
"Zac: To do a- Yeah, so, all right."
"Brennan: I have a question for you, Brennan."
Brennan: Mm-hmm?
"Ally: Targeted strike, when an ally makes an attack against a creature, use your reaction to expend a superiority die, then you add it to the damage. If I have minus d6 to everything, am I the one rolling that, and therefore it negates the d6 or am I giving him a d6?"
Brennan: You're giving it to him and it would double on this attack.
Emily: And it would be a crit.
"Ally: Take two more, baby."
Brennan: So-
"Zac: So it is still eight d6, but I, even though-"
"Brennan: Now you can do this thing 'cause Margaret, even though all Margaret can see is Plinth, Margaret knows that you-"
Margaret: All I see is Plinth.
(group laughing)
Get Plinth.
Skip: Right on.
Margaret: Keep Plinth. Hold Plinth.
Zac: Fuck! (Zac laughing)
Siobhan: That's a lot of ones.
Zac: Okay. 12…
"Ally: Oh, you re-roll ones, though, right?"
Zac: I don't.
(group laughing)
"Siobhan: Yeah, that's actually one of, uh-"
"Emily: Your AC is 25, right?"
"Siobhan: My abilities, so I can just-"
"Ally: Yeah, my AC is 25 and I have a million hit points left."
(Emily laughing)
And I've never seen Plinth.
(group laughing)
Zac: 27 plus six.
"Ally: Hey, hell yeah."
Zac: So that is 33 damage.
Brennan: 33 damage definitely bypasses the threshold.
Lou: Get Plinth!
Zac: Now I'm going to drop off of this platform straight down and then try to hide underneath the platform of the center of the ring.
"Emily: Ooh, I love that."
"Brennan: If you have the movement, you can move and dash, and like bonus action dash to get under the ring if you have the movement to get there."
"Zac: Okay, I'm just gonna jump to a different camera operator."
"Brennan: Cool, copy that."
Zac: So I will roll that hide. That is going to be a 27 to hide. And I gotta roll my new temp HP. It's two d4?
Ally: Mm-hmm.
Emily: Yeah.
(dice clattering)
Zac: Six temporary HP.
Brennan: You also take four points of psychic damage when you attack.
"Zac: Okay, so that goes to my actual total?"
"Brennan: Actual HP, yeah. Smaggy loses her turn to the stun condition, but she is no longer unconscious because of ambient psychic damage from Plinth that wakes her up. So she loses her turn, but she is back up with four less hit points. And after Brobbin is dead,"
(Lou laughing)
(Ally laughing)
"Riva, that's gonna be your turn."
"Siobhan: I'm going to get my Kublacaine hit points back. That's four, so I'm up to a big ol' nine hit points."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Siobhan: I am going to run, now, Sid, can you just make sure that I'm in the right position? I am gonna move to this plinth."
"Murph: Cool, great."
"Siobhan: I am going to, bonus action, go out of this psychodrone, and into one of the psychodrones that's hidden in Barry's backpack."
"Brennan: These are useful for, I think if your body was destroyed. This is effectively allowing you like free teleportation around the battlefield to be able to jump from body to body."
Siobhan: But we paid 800 credits for it.
(Emily laughing)
"Let us do the cool thing, Brennan!"
(group laughing)
"Brennan: See, here's the problem. You guys are adversarial to me, and then I make rulings because your secret plans are against the rules of the game."
"Siobhan: No, our secret rules are good."
"Brennan: See, yeah, your secret rules, exactly."
Emily: I think it's okay. I think you can cast calm emotions on him.
"Siobhan: Okay, then I'll get to there and I will cast calm emotions."
"Murph: Ooh, I appreciate you."
Siobhan: So I get Aurora Nebbins and Barry in that calm emotions.
Emily: Ooh!
"Brennan: Amazing, okay."
"Siobhan: And that, you should still roll to see if you get out of the feared condition on your turn because it's a concentration spell."
Emily: Mmm.
"Siobhan: And when the power ends, any suppressed effect resumes."
"Murph: Got it, okay."
Siobhan: But you are now essentially immune to being charmed or frightened.
Murph: Cool.
Brennan: Any bonus actions from you?
"Siobhan: I mean, I would love to be able to jump to this psychodrone, but if you're not letting me-"
"Brennan: I'm not- Having three bodies that you can rapidly move your consciousness around is very, very good and leads to all kinds of shenanigans in future combats that I don't wanna take part in."
Siobhan: Exactly. Exactly!
"Brennan: No, no, no. I know a bad deal when I see one. No, thank you."
Emily: Can't blame us for trying.
"Brennan: I never knock the hustle. I just make the rulings. Lou, that's gonna you."
"Lou: Great. I think Gunnie's gonna appear from behind this and just yell,"
"Gunnie: Get fucked, Plinth!"
(group laughing)
Murph: Yes!
Lou: And I'm gonna cast explosion on Plinth.
"Brennan: Amazing. Okay, we're gonna cast explosion on Plinth."
Lou: And you know what? Fuck it. I'd love to have both Plinth and Smiggly Squirrel get fucked together.
"Brennan: Okay, now here's the issue."
Lou: Okay.
"Brennan: Explosion has the radius that it has, so you show me where it's going on the battlefield that's not also hitting Riva, Barry or Aurora Nebbins."
"Lou: Oh, great question."
"Murph: If you do it on just Plinth, you can just do it super high, right?"
Lou: Yeah.
Brennan: I think there's no way you're not hitting Barry because the Jumbotron means you can't select a point higher than that as the center of the blast.
"Murph: Can't you go past it, though?"
"Brennan: You could pick a point past Plinth, Pick a point past Plinth."
Ally: Pick a point past Plinth.
Brennan: Just catching Plinth in the edge of a blast radius from like way farther out.
Lou: Let's do that.
Brennan: Okay. So you're like hurling way the fuck out. Boom! Plinth is gonna roll a dexterity saving throw. Here we go.
(rock music)
That is a failure.
Siobhan: Yes!
Zac: Plinth has bad dex.
Emily: Plinth has bad dex!
Lou: We love to watch Plinth fail. Okay. 31 points of damage on Plinth.
Ally: Woo-ee!
Emily: Yeah!
Siobhan: Nice. Nice.
"Brennan: Okay, 31 points of damage on Plinth."
"Jimmy: Folks, Plinth did not like that, I assume."
Emily: Woo.
"Lou: We got it. We got this, we got this. I'm gonna fly forward so that I'm just on the edge of the platform. And I'm going to throw a potent aptitude to Barry."
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: Nice.
"Murph: Cool, thank you."
"Brennan: All right, so you are hovering above the platform like under the Jumbotron, correct?"
"Lou: Yeah, I wanna look Plinth square in his fucking eye."
(group laughing)
"Jimmy: Looks like Gunnie Miggles-Rashbax, engineer of the squad, looking for some kind of eye to mean mug this obelisk."
(group laughing)
Better luck next time. There are no discernible features on this alien technology.
Lou: I'm just gonna pick a point. I'm just gonna pick a point. There.
"Brennan: You hit potent aptitude. After your turn, Brutus is going to weave under there, moves forward. We're gonna roll something very important right now, actually."
Siobhan: Ruh-roh.
Brennan: This is the recharge ability for that venom breath we saw before.
"Siobhan: Oh, God."
Lou: Mm-hmm.
"Brennan: I'm gonna let you know right now, on a five or a six, the venom breath comes back."
Murph: That's so bad.
Brennan: That's a four.
Siobhan: Oh my God.
Brennan: Woo! Okay-
"Zac: Oh God, that was close."
"Ally: Oh, Plinth."
"Brennan: Oh, Plinth!"
"Jimmy: Brutus, the corn brutie charges forward. This first one is coming for Aurora Nebbins. What's Aurora Nebbins's current armor class?"
Emily: 17!
(Zac laughing)
"Uh, do they hit?"
Brennan: They do.
Emily: Hmm.
Ally: That's interesting.
Murph: Poker face.
Ally: Yeah.
Emily: Let's see what the-
Siobhan: Do you wanna put the other pair of sunglasses on underneath?
Emily: See how much damage they do.
Brennan: 26 points of damage to Aurora Nebbins.
Emily: She had one hit point. She's down.
(group laughing)
Brennan: And then it's gonna take two attacks on Riva's psychodrone.
"Siobhan: God damn. It's actually fine, it's whatever."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Here we go...
Lou: It's totally whatever.
Brennan: That's a hit. 28 points of damage to the psychodrone.
Siobhan: So down.
"Brennan: Ax comes down, (Brennan roars) shatters this psychodrone. One of the psychodrones on you (blips) wakes back up. Now I am going to ask for some psychic saves, as like Riva-"
"Siobhan: Oh, yeah."
Brennan: Back on the ship.
"Siobhan: Look, I mean, look, I think I'm still down. I'm just not technically-"
"Brennan: Down, down."
Siobhan: Dead.
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. Yes, 100%. You are, yes, you are not permanently dead."
Murph: So I've got zero hit points.
"Brennan: You have a zero hit points Riva on your back, exactly."
Murph: Right on.
Emily: We can work with that.
Ally: And then you roll for like waking up or getting more hit points?
"Brennan: Yeah, if you have some means of repairing droids, that could bring you back."
"Siobhan: We should do that as quickly as possible, because, actually, my concentration has just gone. So, Gunnie and Aurora are now frightened again."
Murph: Great.
"Brennan: Okay, oh, Barry and Aurora are now frightened, yes."
Emily: Except that Aurora's down.
"Siobhan: Which I think ends the condition, but I could be wrong."
"Brennan: Okay, Barry, that's gonna be you. Yes, you are once again frightened as Riva goes down."
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: Which means your speed is still reduced to zero.
Murph: That's fine. I am frightened and I make attacks with disadvantage. Can I still shoot the Plinth with disadvantage?
"Brennan: You can still shoot the Plinth with disadvantage, correct."
"Murph: Okay, well, let me ask you this. I have this shield."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Murph: Technically to doff it, it takes an action. If I'm willing to just like throw, like object interaction, just like if it rolls off the fucking platform and I lose 2000 credits that I'll, that happens. Can I do that?"
"Brennan: Cool. Yes, you can do that."
"Murph: Cool, sunglasses on. So scared underneath, drop the shield, pull out the rotary cannon. I'm going to rapid shot on the Plinth."
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Ooh.
Murph: To get around the disadvantage.
Brennan: Oh ho ho!
Siobhan: Nice.
"Brennan: Copy that. Go ahead, as you're about to throw the shield away, give me a performance check."
(Murph laughing)
Lou: Let's go.
Siobhan: Let's go. Let's freaking go.
"Murph: Performance, 14."
"Brennan: You toss the shield up into the air. As you do, the shield passes in front of one of the cameras with the Acme-Ashmun logo emblazoned on it."
(Murph laughing)
"And they go,"
"Jimmy: Whoa, little bit of spot product here in the middle of the fight, folks. The Acme-Ashmun team knows how to put on a show."
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: We are gonna go ahead and roll the dexterity saving-
"Margaret: I love you, Barry. I love you, Plinth."
(group laughing)
Brennan: Fails the save.
"Siobhan: Nice, Barry."
Lou: Plinth is done.
"Murph: Oh, can I have my children back from-"
"Emily: Oh, yeah."
Zac: Yes.
Murph: They went on a field trip.
Emily: Kids back from camp.
Zac: These two?
Murph: I need my kids back from camp. Thank you so much.
"Brennan: And remember, you need to beat that damage threshold to do damage at all."
Emily: Yeah.
(suspenseful music)
Lou: Love. Love that. Love that face on Barry.
"Siobhan: Man, these shades are rad as hell."
Lou: They're perfect Barry shades.
Siobhan: Yeah.
Murph: 27 damage.
(Zac gasping)
"Siobhan: Nice, nice."
Murph: And then I'm going to rapid shot again on my second attack.
Brennan: Jesus.
Emily: Yeah.
"Lou: Let's go, Barry."
Brennan: That's another failed save.
Siobhan: Yes-ah!
Emily: Yeah!
Zac: What kind of save is that?
Siobhan: Fuck up this Plinth!
Murph: Dex.
Ally: Wow.
Brennan: Bypassing this thing's armor class is huge.
Murph: 28 damage.
Brennan: Jesus Christ.
"Lou: Dope, dope, dope, dope."
Emily: We don't even need operation slippery puppet.
"Brennan: You guys see, Barry, as Plinth is right in front of you, with the frightened condition on you, which as you know, would give you disadvantage on attack rolls, but this is not attack rolls. You-"
(lasers blasting)
you guys see Plinth riddled with cracks. Oh my goodness!
"Jimmy:Mother Void, do you believe in miracles? The unkillable Plinth is riddled with cracks, folks."
"Chip: I'll tell you what, if the contractors who worked on my condo had to come do this work, that'd be a pretty penny to repair that, Jimmy."
"Jimmy: Right you are, Chip. Holy smokes, folks. Are we gonna have an upset?"
Brennan: Plinth is looking bad.
"Lou: Sid, is it your turn?"
"Emily: Yeah, it is."
Brennan: It is Sid's turn.
Ally: I wish I had sunglasses-
"Siobhan: Oh, I know."
Ally: For this slippery puppet moment.
"Siobhan: Okay, so Barry, where are you on this?"
"Murph: I'm, uh- yo, if you have to fuck me up, fuck me up."
"Siobhan: No, I'm not going to."
Ally: Do I look like I have a Miata?
Emily: Okay.
Lou: Yes.
"Emily: What I'm going to do is I'm gonna use my action to get back on the stage. This is gonna be my last turn. There's no way I survive after this, so I just look around and I say, It's been nice knowing all of you. I'm gonna bonus action med pack Aurora Nebbins."
"Brennan: Incredible. Aurora Nebbins, miraculously back up."
Ally: Ooh!
"Emily: So, she gets some hit points and I'm going to use her to basically throw Riva up to the Plinth."
(group laughing as Siobhan holds up her phone with a picture of sunglasses)
"Brennan: Throw- okay, Riva."
"Brennan: Basically, I need to get Riva like 10 feet closer to the Plinth."
"Zac: Riva's old body, or?"
Emily: Riva's old body.
Lou: Riva's old body.
"Brennan: Copy that. Cool, yes, yes, yes, gotcha."
"Emily: So, Aurora will do that, throw it 10 feet closer, so that I can use a 15 foot cone from Riva's old body onto the Plinth."
Brennan: Okay?
"Emily: And then I take out the remote detonator that I bought for full price at Plug's, and I unleash something called a charge fragmentation, a device used to blow holes in larger constructs and structures. This is what I spent a minute installing into Riva's old drone."
Brennan: Am I getting Ocean's-ed 11-ed on my own fucking show? What the fuck is happening?
"Siobhan: We read the book, Brennan. And by we, I mean just Emily. Emily read the book."
"Emily: Do you wanna know more? Do you wanna know more, Brennan? When detonated, the breaching charge explodes in a 15 foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 14, 16 for me, dexterity saving throw, taking 20d4 kinetic damage on a failed save. Objects, structures and other surfaces have disadvantage to the saving throw."
Murph: Oh my God.
Brennan: How did you know there'd be a Plinth in this fight?
(group laughing)
"Jesus, I'm fucking ruined."
(group laughing)
Every-
Ally: Riva's old body just goes flying.
Brennan: Everyone send your kids to camp. Everyone start sending d4s. 20 d4s?
(Emily laughing)
"Emily: Oh, you do need to roll, though, because if you get a nat one, it actually takes max damage because of my explosives mastery."
Brennan: I'll roll in front of the board just to keep it honest. Here's disadvantage in front of the board. Okay.
Zac: Okay.
"Murph: Oh, I thought that was, okay, so it failed."
Brennan: That's a fail.
Zac: How many more do you need? Do you need any?
Lou: We're gonna murder Plinth.
Emily: I'll roll them maybe-
Murph: Do you need more d4s?
"Emily: 10 at a time. One, two, three, four."
Siobhan: Great.
"Emily: Five, six."
"Murph: God, operation slippery puppet is insane."
(group laughing)
I didn't know you guys were doing this.
"Siobhan: You gotta read the texts, Murph."
Ally: Oh!
"Emily: Okay, 20… 22. It did fail."
"Ally: My kids were rolling really great at camp, actually."
Emily: 44 damage to the Plinth.
Brennan: Give me a performance with advantage.
(giddy giggling)
Zac: Just a pit of spikes and d4s.
"Emily: Already a 19 on one of them, so… 22."
"Brennan: You land. Med pack. You see the crowd- just med packing Andora Nebbins, the crowd goes fucking nuts."
"Jimmy: We're not gonna let the doggy die today, Chip."
"Chip: No, we are not. They'll put you in jail for that, Jimmy."
"Brennan: You see that Aurora Nebbins grabs the droid. Time slows down, crowd going nuts. You see a group of little, green uniformed Galactic Girl Guides kind of chewing on their fingers. They know something's up in this moment. Aurora bound, jumps from one to the other. Plinth rotates. It is Plinth's turn next, and a fifth level psychic power is coming all of your way on Plinth's turn. You hear Jimmy The Snout in the commentator's box go,"
"Jimmy: Chip, it looks like a bit of bad strategy here. I think the team's android thinks that the psychic's mind is still in the old droid- Oh my God! Do you believe it? In the droid's body, there's a thermal-"
(rapid beeping)
(explosions roaring)
"Brennan: In all of the explosive ruptures from Gunnie's fireball in the riddled cracks from the rotary cannon, the detonator made to destroyed structures, you- Margaret, in your mind, you hear,"
Plinth: Go.
Margaret: Plinth?
(group laughing)
Plinth: The prophecy...
(thunderous explosion)
"Jimmy: Folks, a priceless artifact and real son of a bitch is no more! The Acme-Ashmun Gunner Channel has done the impossible today!"
Ally: Yes!
Brennan: Plinth is destroyed! Boom!
Murph: We still got Brutus. Brutus is tough.
Siobhan: Brutus is tough.
Emily: And instead of using my reaction to throw a grenade-
"Brennan: Real quick, everyone within 20 feet of Plinth, which I believe is gonna just be Aurora Nebbins, Barry and Riva's new body with zero, you're gonna auto-fail this. So it's gonna be one death save fail for Riva, and Aurora's gonna take half, no matter what. So Aurora's just gonna go down to zero again. Barry, gimme an intelligence saving throw."
Murph: Ooh. Natural 17. That's a 17.
"Brennan: As Plinth explodes in psychic energy, you are going to take, it's gonna bypass your rage, too."
"Ally: Oh, you're on my critical analysis."
Murph: Does that?
Ally: So you add five.
Murph: So 22.
"Brennan: 22 makes the save, baby."
Emily: Oh!
Brennan: 20 halved to 10 points of damage.
"Murph: Great, thank you."
Ally: Woo!
"Brennan: 10 psychic damage, boom! Crowd going nuts. You see a bunch of Galactic Girl Guides ripping up their tickets and throwing them, stomping out in the audience. At the end of your turn-"
Ally: Did Brutus get hit by the Plinth?
"Siobhan: Yeah, Brutus and the squirrel were both-"
Murph: Did Brutus and the squirrel get hit with the psychic damage?
"Brennan: Oh yes, they did. They both got hit with the psychic blast. Brutus fully makes it. So Brutus is just gonna take 10 points of psychic damage."
Murph: Okay.
(Zac laughing)
Brennan: Smaggy is gonna go ahead and take the full 20. Legendary action.
(synthesizer music)
Murph: Okay.
Brennan: End of that turn. Brutus kicks Aurora Nebbins off the dais.
(Emily gasping)
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Jimmy: Uh-oh, looks like that corn construct is tired of that dog popping back up."
"Gunnie: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say the amount of money we were gonna make."
Brennan: Margaret.
Emily: What the hell do I do?
Brennan: That's gonna be you.
"Ally: Um… I have one hit point, and I am a leader, but I also need to snort some Kublacaine with my action. So I just kind of sheepishly reach in and snort some Kublacaine. And then I just hold onto the ankles of the camera person nearest me."
"Brennan: Looks down. You see the camera guy, all the camera people are fine. They have weird like psychic earplugs in, like,"
"Camera operator: that Plinth is a doozy, huh?"
(Ally laughing)
"Brennan: As you're going in for the bump, you see the camera wheels around it says,"
"Jimmy: All right, modern businesswoman, Margaret Encino doing a quick bump mid-combat."
"Ally: Absolutely not, absolutely not. They do not record that."
Zac: It's part of our deal.
Brennan: But you're-
Ally: I have colleagues to worry about.
"Brennan: Amazing, okay."
Siobhan: We're your colleagues.
"Ally: Different, hot colleagues, okay."
Brennan: Amazing.
Siobhan: Oh.
"Brennan: Okay, so that's your action. Any bonus actions from Margaret?"
"Ally: My critical analysis is going to move to… So, it goes to-"
Emily: I'm probably gonna get knocked off this thing.
"Ally: Oh yeah, maybe, okay, yeah. I'll give it to Sid. I go,"
"Margaret: Sid, you can't see me, but you're doing a great job."
(Emily laughing)
Ally: And I'm just holding onto someone's ankles.
Brennan: Incredible. Margaret-
Ally: So close to their shoe.
"Brennan: Back to the top, that's Skip."
"Zac: Skip, having hidden up there, would like to take a sneak attack shot on, what's his name? The- Brutus."
Ally: Ooh.
"Brennan: Hell, yeah, go for it."
Zac: 28.
Brennan: 28 for Brutus?
Zac: To hit.
Brennan: 28 hits Brutus.
Zac: Okay. And so this will be a priming attack.
Brennan: Cool.
Ally: I'll do targeted strike.
Zac: So it's a-
"Ally: Six, baby. You add six to whatever this damage roll is."
"Zac: Oh, cool. I'm taking away two d6."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Zac: And so it's just… five, six… 17 damage."
Brennan: 17 damage to Brutus.
Zac: And I will say that they have to make a wisdom saving throw for the priming attack. 16 is the DC.
Brennan: Succeeds on the wisdom saving throw.
Murph: Damn.
"Zac: Aw, fuck!"
Siobhan: This guy is weirdly wise.
Zac: I forgot to do the angle perception thing. God dammit.
"Brennan: That's all right, you- pew, take another shot. Hits Brutus. He's looking fine, gang. That's gonna be Smaggy Squirrel."
"Zac: Oh, can I bonus section hide real fast?"
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it."
(synthesizer music)
Zac: That's gonna be a… 16.
Brennan: A 16?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool, Brutus does not see you. Smaggy absolutely does."
"Siobhan: Now is Smaggy actually a squirrel, or is this like a furry situation?"
Brennan: This is an android situation.
Siobhan: Okay.
Ally: It can both.
(Ally laughing)
"Brennan: So you go to hide and you hear,"
"Jimmy: Uh-oh, they've been down for most of the match, but it looks like Uncle's Bob's Fantanimal Land is back in it. Someone likes to show that they can climb, too. And you look up and see that Smaggy has bounded up to your chamber."
Zac: I forgot to roll my d4s last turn for temp HP.
"Brennan: Oh, yeah, go ahead and roll them."
(synthesizer music)
(dice rolling)
Zac: Three.
Brennan: Gotcha. And hits you for 23 points of damage.
Zac: Uncanny dodge.
Siobhan: Ooh.
Brennan: Halved to 11 points of damage.
(Smaggy chittering)
"Boom. That is Smaggy, and she used her bonus action to hide there, so she is not hidden now. She's fully visible up on top of that structure."
"Zac: Oh, bonus action to leap up there?"
"Brennan: Yeah, she used her bonus action, exactly. Gunnie, it's gonna be you."
"Lou: Great, I fly forward. I'm gonna repair droid on-"
Siobhan: Wait-
Emily: Riva?
Siobhan: You might actually not need to. Let me double check with Brennan before you use a turn to do this.
"Lou: Okay, great."
Siobhan: The language of Kublacaine says that I regain two d4 hit points at the beginning of every turn.
Brennan: Temp HP don't get you back up to one.
Emily: Yeah.
Lou: Great.
Siobhan: Great.
Lou: Repair droid.
"Emily: Okay, awesome."
Siobhan: Thank you so much.
"Emily: Oh, that's so good."
Lou: Great.
Emily: You understand why I couldn't have repaired droid you?
Lou: That's a cool.
Siobhan: Absolutely. We needed to do exactly what happened.
Lou: Eight hit points to Riva's new drone.
Emily: Yes.
Siobhan: Thank you so much.
"Lou: Do some quick mechanics work on that. Then I'm gonna pull back, kind of still at the same height that I'm at."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Lou: And just yell down to Brutus, Hey! Oh- Over here, asshole! And I'm gonna chuck two sabotage charges at him. Two dexterity saving throws."
Emily: Woo!
Lou: It's just two d6.
"Brennan: Okay. Roll the damage separately, 'cause he makes one save and fails another."
Lou: So the first one's an eight.
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Lou: Uh, that's off the table."
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
Lou: The second one's a 10.
"Brennan: Boom, boom. As the fire erupts, it is now his turn again. We're gonna roll in front of the board once more, five or six, he gets his breath weapon back."
(die clatters)
That's a five.
Siobhan: Fuck.
"Brennan: I'm gonna need constitution saving throws from Gunnie, Norman, and I'll make one for Smaggy Squirrel, as well."
Zac: Do we get any cover or anything?
"Brennan: Unfortunately, no, because it's a gas that's like filling up the area."
Zac: Constitution saves. So I get to do this with d4 because of-
Siobhan: Yes.
Zac: Kublacaine?
Siobhan: The Kublacaine.
Zac: Fuck.
"Siobhan: Ooh, that was rough. That was a rough throw."
(suspenseful music)
Brennan: Okay. What did we get here?
Zac: 10.
Brennan: 10.
Lou: 22.
Brennan: 22\. Gunnie makes the save.
Lou: God.
Brennan: 62 points of damage. Skip is down. Smaggie squirrel also down.
"Lou: Gunnie's still standing. Still standing, still strong. It's Brutus and us."
Brennan: Brutus and us.
"Ally: So Smaggy, she's down?"
"Brennan: In the final, the way it was supposed to be."
Siobhan: Yeah.
Ally: I wanna see you in the final.
"Murph: Brutus, I don't like that you threw the dog off the pedestal, but other than that-"
"Siobhan: I can give him disadvantage, though."
"Murph: And, you know, also killing my friends."
Zac: Yeah.
Murph: You stuck to your word.
Siobhan: He's so close to the edge.
"Brennan: And he moves to be within swat distance of Sid. Barry, or it's you guys are actually on the same initiative so you can choose what order you want to go in, but."
Emily: What I want to do more than anything-
Brennan: Mm-hmm.
"Emily: Is bonus action med pack my dude, reaction throw stun grenade at the dude and then use my motivator extra speed to get underneath Aurora Nebbins so that next turn, I can cast enhance ability and double my carrying capacity to catch Aurora Nebbins."
Brennan: What is the range on your med pack?
"Emily: It is, uh, 60 feet."
Brennan: Does it mention anything about line of sight on the med pack ability?
Emily: Creature of your choice that you can see within range.
Lou: I can get him.
Emily: You can get him?
Lou: It won't be before his turn.
"Murph: He doesn't have any death saves, though."
Emily: Can I do a perception check to try to see him?
"Brennan: There's no possible, because he's in that crow's nest. There's no way for you to see him without getting above him."
"Emily: I really, I tried. Okay,"
"Sid: I don't know where you are. I really wanted to heal you, but I just can't see ya."
Skip: Right on.
Emily: Can I use my bonus action right now to try and stun him?
Brennan: Try and stun Brutus?
Emily: Yeah.
"Brennan: You use your bonus action to try and stun him, yeah."
"Murph: Actually, I think that doesn't do any good, 'cause I have have advantage."
Brennan: He would auto feel strength saves.
"Siobhan: Oh, yes, that would be really helpful for me."
"Murph: I mean, that's fucking huge."
Emily: So I'm gonna just spike a stun at him.
Zac: Through his legs.
"Emily: Yeah, just like fucking nick off a kernel."
"Brennan: You throw a stun grenade at him. And I will use the lingo of the game we are all playing, burns through his first legendary resistance."
Emily: First?
Murph: Dammit.
"Siobhan: Oh, okay."
Brennan: You see that Vercadian programming just-
Emily: I think I gotta save my reaction to shield if he actually hits me.
Brennan: Cool.
"Emily: So I just gotta be like, all right, peace! And then I'm gonna use my motivator boost to try to get down underneath Aurora."
Brennan: You do motivator boost. You fall back. He's gonna take a swing at you.
Emily: Okay.
Brennan: What's your current armor class?
"Emily: My current armor class is 18, but I do have a mirror image up."
Brennan: Give me the roll from your image.
Murph: Come on.
Siobhan: Come on.
Emily: I didn't get it.
"Brennan: Okay, so it bypasses to you."
"Emily: Okay, shield."
Brennan: Misses.
"Emily: Oh, okay!"
"Siobhan: Oh, God."
(Emily sighing)
"Brennan: You even hear,"
"Jimmy: Oh no, it looks like the android's off the side of the platform, folks!"
Brennan: It looks like Brutus knocked you off. You go down.
Emily: And then I'm gonna drop the concentration from motivator boost to cast enhance droid on myself to double my carrying capacity.
"Brennan: This ax comes up, hits your shield, sends you off and your motivator boost dies, and you see those like engines come off in you and you hear,"
"Jimmy:Oh God, it looks like Brutus took out the motivator boost. That's a direct- What is that? No, it's a different engine coming online."
Brennan: And your rocket boosts hit. You go up and the crowd looks down.
"Jimmy: We can't see her, get a camera! Get a camera on Sundry Sidney! Folks!"
"Brennan: Boom. You get under, and like Superman, these roller skates, white- hot roller skates, with twin jets of flame as you Superman this enormous, spined dog. As it comes above the lip of the dais,"
(Brennan heaves)
"Jimmy: Folks, Sundry Sidney has saved the dog!"
(crowd cheering)
"Brennan: The crowd goes fucking nuts. People are punching each other in the stands, just losing their minds."
Sid: Nothing comes between a mother and her daughter.
"Jimmy: Folks, this droid can do anything, and this fight's not over yet!"
Brennan: Tune in next week for the thrilling conclusion-
(Emily screaming)
Brennan: -of the Battle of the Brands here at the Kubla-Cola Gladiatorial Arena! Brutus versus the Acme-Ashmun Gunner Channel. See you then.
Zac: I'm so excited.

Ally: How much damage would I take if I just kind of dropped out of my nest onto the ground?
Lou: How many hit points you got?
Ally: I got eight hit points.
"Siobhan: Why would you, like, don't you have a gun?"
"Emily: Oh, stop. He wants this to happen."
Murph: What are you gonna do down there?

Murph: You would stay up.
Ally: Let's do it.

(Emily laughing)
Siobhan: This is the sensible Beardsley season.

(Upbeat Music)
": Hello, one and all. Welcome back to another thrilling episode of Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey. I'm your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always, our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
": [All] Hi, intrepid heroes."
": Last we left off, our intrepid heroes were in the midst of the Battle of the Brands at the Kubla-Cola Gladiatorial Arena here in Mas Vegas, Lavada. We were confronted upon our arrival in Mas Vegas with the most intense gearing-up I've ever seen PCs preparing for a fight, as well as a sudden discovery of 12 seemingly very well-versed in the tenets of the Cosmic Veil women on vacation here in Mas Vegas, Lavada. And then the fight commenced between the different brand champions. Representing the Acme-Ashmun Corporation, the Gunner Channel, their new champions, making an appeal to the proldier lifestyle so common these days in AnarchEra in the wide, wide galaxy. We also met the Triangle Mint Plinth. Go Plinth! The Plinth was destroyed along with Brobbin Bunny and Smaggy Squirrel, the representatives of Uncle Bob's Fantanimalland, leaving us staring down the Korncake construct from Kansas, Amercadia. Brutus! Brutus, high up in hit points, with a chance of recharging his terrible venomous breath weapon-"
: I hate it.
: On his turn. Let's get those HP totals from our current competitors.
: 12.
: Eight.
: Zero.
: Eight for now.
: 14.
: 64!
: Hey! (group cheering)
": [Siobhan] Our big, strong boy."
": Hey, and Brutus has like"
: It pays to be friends with Brutus.
": It pays to be friends with Brutus. Gang, we dive right back in! Over the comms, Well, well, well! We've still got a fight on our hands, folks. Everybody, strap in. It's gonna be a bumpy ride. Barry, that is your turn."
: Sweet.
: Saw him in the finals.
: I will take... I'm not gonna do anything elegant. I will take the falling damage to step off and get within swinging distance of him.
: Okay.
": So how much movement would you say that is, a foot, five feet?"
: To just fall off?
: To just fall off. (laughs)
: [Brennan] Okay.
: I'll take the damage.
: Classic Big Barry.
: Can't you do Why don't you just-
: I will.
: Maybe he wants his-
": Oh, maybe you're going to."
: Oh!
": Oh, interesting."
": It's gonna be 2d6 kinetic damage. So we'll call that, that's eight."
: [Brennan And Murph] Halved to four.
": Sweet. I land, dust myself off. (gritty rock music) Put on my shades. Brutus, it's the finals. (group laughs) And then I'm going to grapple him. (player gasps)"
: Ooh.
: [Brennan] Okay.
: So I am in the zone.
: [Brennan] Hell yes.
: So I roll with advantage.
: He is in the zone.
: [Brennan] Okay.
: Oh no.
: [Murph] Here we go.
: I imagine the music the music right now is so tense.
": Oh my goodness, this is-"
: [Brennan] One can only-
: This is the first move?
: [Siobhan] The first move- grapple.
: [Emily] I'm gonna puke.
: My man fell. (laughs) My man fell easily to 30 feet.
: Just so brutally rolled my ankle. (group laughing) Ow.
: That's a brutal ankle roll.
": Brutus, ugh."
": Ugh, fuck me."
: [Brennan] Okay. (Ally laughs) I am going to-
: [Lou] God damn.
: [Siobhan] This rules. This rules.
: Okay. Go ahead and roll your Athletics.
: [Lou] Classic Big Barry.
: [Zac] Oh my god.
": Oh my gosh, you're... Oh my goodness."
: Does anybody have anything to add?
: Yeah.
: Didn't you have a-
: [Lou] You have a-
: Potent Aptitude?
: [Lou] Potent Aptitude die.
: So what is it?
: 1d6. But you're not gonna need it.
": Yeah, yeah."
: [Ally and Siobhan] You're not gonna need it-
: [Siobhan] 'Cause you're gonna crit.
": And I got a d6, or, sorry, I have a plus five I can throw on you, like, with my intelligence modifier-"
": Okay, so let's see, I can-"
: If I make Critical Analysis.
: Actually try this twice. So let's wait for that one.
": Okay, cool."
": Cool, here's roll number one. (die rolls)"
: That's a 28 without his d6.
: Okay.
: [Lou] Throw that on there. Throw that on there.
": [Ally] Come on, baby."
: And a six. (group gasps)
": What did I say, 28?"
: 34.
": 28, 34."
": That's a 34. Do you wanna gimme the five, just in case he's, like, insane, and he crits or something?"
: Yeah.
: [Brennan] Okay.
: 39.
: 39.
: [Zac] 39.
: That is unbelievable.
: [Zac] Barry.
": Barry, oh my god, you're so strong."
": This is an opposed Athletics, correct?"
: Correct.
: Okay. We're gonna roll. A 39 is truly unbelievable. (group laughing) (Murph shouts) I'm gonna let you know right now that Brutus has to... Let me just look at these stats again. (tense music) (sighs) Brutus has to hit a nat 20.
": Oh my god, please don't."
: Rolling with advantage. (tense music) (group cheers)
: When you have a creature grappled-
: [Brennan] Yes.
: You can move half speed.
: That's correct.
: So I would like to walk him over to the edge and just fuckin' drop him.
": Okay, hell yes."
": [Siobhan] Yes, Barry."
": You pick Brutus up. You walk him to the edge and drop him. Okay, here's how this is gonna work now. Crowd goes absolutely berserk, give me Performance with advantage, real quick. (group cheers)"
": [Lou] Of course, of course."
: Nat 20.
: Really? Really?
: Oh!
: Oh my fucking god.
": Oh, oh!"
: I just look around and go-
: Put on a second pair of sunglasses.
": Sorry, I guess got... Barry-ed away. (player gasps)"
: No!
": [Siobhan] Yes! Yes, Barry."
": Margaret, the executive that you saw look up, the-"
: [Ally] Uh-huh. (group laughing) Uh-huh.
": [Lou] Oh my god, he's in the zone! ÔÖ¬ Highway to the danger zone ÔÖ¬"
: [Brennan] So here's the deal.
: Your final form!
": So here's actually the deal. On that nat 20 Performance check, the executive who looked up from their phone, you see goes, Yes! Yes! Yes! Over and over again."
: I start to record that so I can show it to him if we're ever in trouble.
": In trouble, be like, I have-"
": Uh, you loved it."
": You fucking loved it, actually."
": We should've put money on ourselves. God, we're stupid."
: How are we ever gonna pay- (gasps)
": Well, he could still get out. So that, okay."
": Okay, so here's the deal. This is pretty simple. He's going to get what any of you would've gotten going over the edge. He's gonna get a Dexterity saving throw to try to grapple to hang on as he drops. He has a good Dex saving throw, but it is not a surefire thing. It's a Dexterity 15 save to grab onto the edge."
": Can I... This would be doing things slightly out of order, but I didn't know that there was a Dexterity saving throw involved in falling over. I have-"
: [Emily] A second attack.
: I have a second attack.
: Hell yeah.
": And I would have done this first, if I knew there was gonna be a Dexterity saving throw."
: Okay.
: I bought nets.
: Okay.
": Which, if I hit him with an attack-"
: Sure.
": He is caught up in the net and is restrained, and on his, he can use an action to use a Strength to get out of it."
: Cool.
": If he fails the... If I hit him with the net, he has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws."
": That is correct, if you hit him with the net, he has disadvantage."
: I chuck a fuckin' net at him. (group chuckling)
: [Brennan] Okay.
: If that's cool.
: [Brennan] That's cool.
: Little corn fishy.
": Oh, please. So this is just a regular attack. This isn't like an insane Athletics check thing. But that's a 26 to hit."
": Okay, a large or smaller creature, yeah, he's large."
: Is he too big? I brought so many nets.
: I'm gonna roll-
: Brennan.
: In the Box of Doom. Roll in the Box of Doom. He needs both of these dice to be six or higher.
: Okay.
": Okay, that's not-"
": All right, okay."
: So one-
: It's not impossible.
": One through five, a quarter of a die."
": Yes, absolutely."
: Yeah.
: [Zac] Quarter of a die.
": Here we go, this is-"
: You gonna let us see it?
: I'm gonna let you see it.
: A classic everyone stands up.
: [Brennan] Everyone stands up.
: [Ally] All rise.
": Again, and I'm gonna point out, this is his last chance. I'm not gonna pull other shenanigans. We have the funniest return to combat, a truly 10-minute-"
: Amazing.
: An eight-minute battle-
: Truly amazing.
: Sequence at the top of an episode. I wanna give space for how honorable I'm being in this moment.
: You are being so honorable.
: I'm being so honorable.
: You really are.
": Will you roll them one at a time, just for tension?"
: Really respect.
: For tension? Okay.
: Really respect.
": If this is a one through five, it's over. If this one is a one through five, it's over, and your crew gets 1.2 million galactic credits."
: That is so much money.
": You have a one in four, there's a 25­hance that your ship makes a Okay? Here's die number one. That's a 14."
: Okay.
: Oh my god.
: Okay. All right.
": I just saw the four, and I swear to god."
": [Ally] Me too, me too."
": Okay, millionaires, now a 25Çhance. There's one die left."
: I feel alive.
: [Siobhan] I'm gonna cry.
: Me too.
: [Zac] No whammy.
: [Brennan] 18.
": [Ally] Okay. (all sighing, groaning)"
": Okay, makes the save."
: I loved it anyways though. It was awesome.
: It was great.
: It was still awesome.
": Barry, that ruled."
: That ruled.
: That fucking ruled.
": This is the realest this has ever been, that was crazy."
: I have him on the edge though.
: [Brennan] You have him on the edge.
: You have him on the edge.
": Yeah, he's what, like literally holding on?"
": Literally one hand, yes."
: [Siobhan] Great.
: Okay.
": And the restrained condition, he has to use an action. So a creature has four slowed levels. Attacks against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack roles have disadvantage. Slowed, speed reduced to zero, and can't benefit from any bonus to speed."
: Does he have to redo a Dex saving throw if he takes damage while he's hanging on the edge like this?
": He will not have to redo a Dex saving throw while he's hanging like this. He's got his incredibly strong android arm up there. But everyone has advantage on attacks against him for the moment, and he is, he is truly in... He's gummed-up in a net, hanging off the side of the dais, to outrageous applause. Cool."
": With my bonus action, I would like to jump 30 feet straight up into the air, and then come down and be drop-kicking him, and risk myself falling off the edge to make him do another Dexterity saving throw."
": Okay, wait a minute, as your bonus... What's the wording of your bonus action?"
": It does... I can move 30 feet, and I do my Strength damage. But I'm saying, landing on his fucking head, like I'm saying-"
: Okay.
": I'm down to also be hanging on the edge, if I fail."
": You're down to also be hanging on the edge, if you fail. Okay, here's-"
": Oh my god, Barry, no!"
: Barry.
": Here's how I'm going to allow it. So the five damage goes through no matter what, right, which is gonna be halved to two for the TaleSpire Crew. So, deals two damage to him. If you want to try to trigger another Dexterity save, I'm gonna put this many restrictions on it, 'cause we are fully breaking the rules of the game."
": Great, great."
": Number one, you will have to hit him on an attack. It will be a straight attack."
": Okay, okay."
": No ability to get advantage, but not with disadvantage either."
: Okay.
": If you miss, you're straight over the side. Then, only if you hit him does he also make the save. In that case, he would make another save with disadvantage, like the one we just did. You would make the same save not with disadvantage. Not with disadvantage, you'd make it straight, DC 15."
: How's your Dex?
: Two.
": [Siobhan] Mm, maybe-"
: All right.
: Please don't.
: I relax. (Ally and Emily laugh)
: Please don't.
": All right, and boom, land down again. Deal the damage to him."
": Maybe back up, Barry."
: I don't know how much movement-
: Can you chuck me onto the dais?
: I probably had to move 12 feet just to get him to the edge.
: Yeah.
: I might have like five feet. I'll move like five feet back-
: Cool.
: To not be right on the edge.
: [Lou] That's all right.
": You move five feet back. Okay, end of your turn. He has an attack with reach. He's going to take an attack with disadvantage against you."
: [Murph] Okay.
": One hand, just- (player groans)"
": Disadvantage, okay, that's still gonna be a 24 to hit."
: Yep.
: That's gonna do it. I'm gonna need a Constitution saving throw.
": Nice. Oh wait, sorry."
: Add your d4 to it.
": Let me, at the start of last turn, I should have added Kublacaine dice."
: Okay.
": Two, okay, so I started it with six. I'm back up to 64 from 60."
: [Brennan] Cool.
: Con save?
: Con save.
": There's the rolls back, a seven."
": Okay, you take,"
: Okay.
": Kinetic damage, and then you also take six poison damage, which is not halved. That is Brutus' legendary action. Next in the initiative is gonna be Margaret."
": Oh, cool. Okay, I would like to just kind of drop a stun grenade off the side of my-"
: Yeah.
: Dais at the corn.
: Hell yes.
: Oh my gosh.
: It's a 10-foot-
": Does restrained mean you auto- Oh, it's a Con save."
: Incapacitated.
: Yeah.
": Yeah, yeah, restrained isn't gonna help with the Con save. But if you miraculously... If he rolls really bad, you'll knock him out, and he'll be dead."
": He would be unconscious, right?"
: Yeah.
: And then let go?
: Is restrained for Dex saves?
: Yeah.
: Same thing?
": Yeah, restrained is just, his movement is zero until... On his turn, he's just gonna bust out so fast, 'cause it's only, it's a DC 12 check."
": Yeah, this is a DC 14 check."
": DC 14 check? All right, throwing a stun grenade?"
: Yeah.
: Another stun grenade goin' over the edge. Here we go.
: Margaret's gettin' into the grenadier lifestyle.
: [Brennan] (growls) Does not appear to stun him.
": Okay, then I would … How much damage would I take if I just kind of dropped out of my nest onto the ground?"
: If you jumped from the nest to the ground?
: I'm just wondering.
": [Brennan] Just wondering, it would be about … It's about 30 feet."
: And how much damage would I take?
: 3d6.
: 3d6.
: How many hit points you got?
": Margaret, don't."
: I've got eight hit points.
: Why would you play … Don't you have a gun?
": But you're doing Kublacaine, right?"
: Mm-hmm.
: So did you get some temp HP at start of your turn?
": Yeah, great point."
": [Emily] Oh, stop!"
: [Siobhan] Come on.
: [Emily] He wants this to happen.
: [Murph] What are you gonna do down there?
: You already used your action.
: Statistically-
: You already used your action.
: [Brennan] So roll these temp HP.
: Six.
": [Brennan] So that's 14, statistically-"
: You would stay up.
: You would stay up.
: It's hard to roll a 14 with 3d6. (group laughing) I know that.
": I'll tell you that right now, it's hard to roll-"
A: I plop out of my nest onto the ground.
: Hell yeah. (Emily mutters)
": Roll it front, right?"
: Yeah.
": Yeah, roll in front, please."
: [Murph] We demand.
": Roll in front? Okay. So Margaret, you leap from the crow's nest, crowd goes wild. Uh-oh, look-"
"A: Leap? No, I fall out of the crow's nest. I roll out the crows nest going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
": Trying to jump in a pencil skirt, that's just-"
: Looks like a fan has gotten- (group laughing)
: [Brennan] Here we go.
: Yeah!
: Okay.
: Yeah!
: That is 11 damage.
: Okay.
: Still kind of a lot.
: I don't love it.
": And I wanna roll, I wanna be right next to the corn cutie, like right there."
: Okay.
: Why?
: [Brennan] Copy that.
": I go right up to it and I go, you fuckin' suck."
": (laughs) Okay, copy that. Copy that."
": Holy shit, what?"
": But you take 11 damage, so you cut through your temp HP-"
": Yeah, now I got-"
": And there's five, you have-"
: I have three.
": Three hit points left, okay. You hear, uh-oh, looks like Margaret Encino, business manager for the Gunner Channel, has taken a tumble out of the camera nest."
": Yeah, I walk right into its area, and I say, you suck."
: Okay.
: That attack of opportunity?
: Does it get one?
: What?
: It does not get an attack of opportunity.
: Why would it get an attack of opportunity?
: What? Why not?
: [Zac] 'Cause when you-
": Wait, do I have enough movement to then leave?"
: To then leave-
: Yeah.
: Its threatened area? I believe it's-
": I walk up and I say, you suck, and then I walk away. Then I limp away."
: Why do you want it to attack of opportunity?
: What are you doing?
": All right, what is-"
: It's a trigger so that Murph can-
: [Emily] I think we can go with it...
": [Brennan] Yeah, you walk away, and it takes an attack of opportunity on you."
": [Ally] Then Call to the Guards, and I wanna-"
: [Brennan] No!
": Call at Barry. And if you attack, now you're attacking Barry instead of me, and if you miss, he gets an immediate attack on the corn."
: And you're rolling with disadvantage 'cause of the net.
: And I'm gonna go ahead and do a Shove attack. (group laughing)
": Ow, my arm is, like, completely bent out. I fell out of my nest."
": [Brennan] Okay, okay, okay."
": You suck, goodbye, oh."
: Oh my god. I cannot believe-
: [Ally] Guards!
": Why would I assume that you were doing something crazy and not, oh my god."
: This is the sensible Beardsley season.
: Oh my fucking god.
": Yeah, exactly. No more tomfoolery."
": No more tomfoolery here. Okay, okay, okay, wait."
: This is not tomfoolery.
": [Brennan] Yeah, I guess-"
: This is tom-sensibly.
": Okay, tom-sensibly indeed. Okay, Call to the Guards. When a creature makes an Attack roll against you, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die, command a willing ally within five feet of that creature to use their reaction to intercede. The creature's then forced to make an attack on the ally instead. If the attack misses-"
: Oh my god.
: The ally can immediately make a weapon attack against the creature as part of-
": Oh, it has to be a weapon."
": Has to be weapon attack, as a part of that same reaction, roll the superiority die and add the result to the ally's Attack role."
: This my last superiority die.
": Okay, I'm gonna roll. I'm gonna roll here, rolling with disadvantage."
": And I'm gonna cast Shield, so now my AC will be 20."
": Cool, awesome."
": Oh, no, no, no."
": Oh, no, no, you-"
": You have to use your reaction for the ability. But it can't hit you, no matter what, it's attacking-"
": Oh, it would be a miss-"
: It would be a miss.
: On Barry.
": Yes, if it hits Barry-"
": Got it, got it, got it."
: He doesn't get the attack.
": Got it, got it, got it, okay."
": We're gonna roll with disadvantage. Okay. Eight, eight on the die, plus... eight on the die plus 12 is 20."
": Wait, didn't you give your Critical Analysis to him, and now you're within 10 feet. Does that boost his AC?"
": Oh, no, no, I would've had to keep my Critical Analysis on myself."
": Oh, okay."
: But you still have- oh.
: [Murph] You don't have your reaction?
: [Ally] Yeah.
: So I think 20 does hit.
: Yeah.
: Fuck.
": Okay, that was incredible. I keep coming so close-"
: It was really cool.
: To this all being over.
": It was really, really cool."
: It was really fucking cool.
: God damnit!
: So cool.
: So it's gonna take... But it is gonna take a swat.
: Fuck.
": I mean, it took, it was a long walk."
: It was a long walk.
: It was a really long walk.
": Thank you for walking with me, everybody."
": A long fall, okay, there was no walking."
: This has just been really so fun.
: Gettin' a long fall.
: [Lou] Long fall.
: Imagine if I'd fallen and died. (laughs)
": I cannot imagine, like as Gunnie, watching Margaret, like all of this shit is going down. Barry's pushing this corn. I see Margaret up in the crow's nest go-"
: Oh my god.
: And then just jump.
: [Brennan] Gimme the Con save.
": There are the rolls again, nine."
": Okay, this I can do. You can use a second reaction each round to train your Critical Analysis, if a friendly creature is making a saving throw."
: Okay.
: So now you get plus five to that.
: I don't think that's gonna be worth it. It's gonna get me up to 14.
": Oh damn. Well, maybe."
: It's just extra damage.
": [Brennan] Okay, five plus seven is 12, halved to six kinetic."
: Okay.
: [Brennan] And then the poison comes in for 11 points of poison damage.
": [Murph] All right, I'm at 28."
: Now the corn cutie has used his reaction though.
: [Brennan] Yes.
: [Siobhan] Nice.
: I'm gonna use my reaction to try to heal.
: Nice.
: And that's a six.
: [Brennan] Okay.
: So I get six back.
": Legendary action, I have figured a way to get myself out of this. I, also, am good at this game."
: We know.
": We know, no hype, it's just-"
: That's why we spent hours last night trying to figure it out.
: Okay.
": 'Cause you're much better at this game than us, but there are six of us."
: Here we go.
: Six of us.
": He's rolling with disadvantage. He just can't hit a nat one here. disadvantage to attack the net, which he can do with a legendary action. Shreds the net with an ax, on a minimum damage, cuts through the net. That is the end of Margaret's turn. Skip, I'm gonna need a death saving throw."
": Damnit, I was, yeah, okay. Trying to see... Nat 20."
: [Ally] Oop.
: 11.
: [Brennan] 11.
": Well, that's still a save."
: [Murph] That's a pass.
: Yeah.
: [Emily] It's a save.
": Okay. That's a death save success from Skip. At the end of Skip's turn, he cannot move. And I'm gonna say that hanging off the edge, he's still attacking with disadvantage, even though he's not in the net anymore."
: Great.
": He's gonna take another one and take a swing at Barry, who he can hit. Or, actually, sorry. There's Sid, and there's Barry, right?"
: And there's me.
": No, Barry's the one he's scared of, he's gonna go for Barry."
: [Siobhan] What's his reach?
: Seven plus 12 is 19.
: [Murph] God damnit. Yep.
: [Brennan] Okay.
: [Lou] Barry!
: 19 hits you? I thought you had 20.
": I switched to the gun just to shoot the thing, which I needed to."
: Oh yeah.
: Is the shield on the floor? Can you pick it up?
: 14 halved to seven kinetic.
": [Siobhan] I mean, not this turn."
": And then the poison bypasses that, 15 poison damage."
": Guys, I'm almost down."
: [Siobhan] Good to know.
: I'm at 12.
": Gunnie, that's gonna be you. I have Oil Slick. And a creature that is in the oil slick immediately has to make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If I use the oil slick on homeboy, will he have to make a check to keep from falling down?"
": He will. I'm going to remind you, only because it came up in combat already, that this creature does have legendary resistances."
: Got it.
": However, with the wording of Oil Slick, does it have to make one on subsequent turns if it moves through the oil?"
": When oil appears, creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn must also succeed-"
: Ends its turn.
: On a Dexterity saving throw.
": Okay, ends its turn. So it's possible that it could chew through a legendary resistance here, but he would almost certainly burn one to get through there. However, how long do you wanna mess around with legendary resistances for?"
": [Emily] Yeah, right."
": [Murph] Yeah, we don't wanna mess with it."
": Even if we burn a legendary resistance, that's useful to us."
": I think, healing Barry."
": I mean, I'm dead on this turn, I think, no matter what, once he attacks me, so it doesn't matter."
": I mean, I think that even if you get healed, you get taken down, right?"
: 'Cause it's doing-
": Yeah, probably."
": So much damage, it's almost not worth healing you."
: Cool. I'm flying to Skip.
": [Murph] Yep, smart, okay."
": Oh wow. Not to Skip, I think I'll fly up high enough to see Skip. That'll be a bonus action, d4, and we'll cast that at a 3rd-level, or 2nd-level. Seven plus five, plus... That's it, seven plus five for Skip. That's a bonus action. I think, then, I'm just gonna take my turn to fly with a dash to the camera control center above Barry and the squad."
: Copy that.
": Kind of where the corn cutie is looking at for the TaleSpire Crew, that high. So I'll get up there."
: What's the position like if he has a poison breath?
: If he has poison breath.
: We just have to all be-
": Yeah, just-"
: We have to make it-
: Just spread.
: So he can only hit-
: Make sure to scatter.
: One or two of us every time.
": I think I'm trying to hit that angle of like, having you be on one side-"
": [Emily] Oh, perfect."
: And having me be on the other.
: I'm so nervous.
": And then I think that's all of my movement. I'm just gonna throw a grenade, but I don't think... It's a gas grenade, and I think it would just fuck up you guys. There's just too much already going on."
": No, you can throw it with, you can throw it-"
: You could.
: To the side so that you just get him.
: I'll throw a gas grenade at this thing.
: [Brennan] Okay.
: [Zac] What does that do?
: It needs to fail a Con save.
: I think it has to make a DC 20 Con save.
": Yeah, I think it's a Con save though. Oh, it's probably a DC 14."
: Whoa.
: DC 14?
: Yeah.
: What type of grenade is it?
: It is a gas grenade.
": DC 14 Constitution saving throw, takes 2d6 poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one."
: Doesn't it obscure the area?
": Oh, it does, I think, yeah."
: Yeah.
: Okay.
": Yeah, yeah, it does obscure the area."
": Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while in the cloud."
: Yeah.
: Uh-huh.
: Poisoned would mean more disadvantage.
: Cool.
": It does a lot of poison, I wonder..."
": I think it's poison-based, but yeah, go ahead and make that save."
": Oh, yeah, yeah."
": We'll make that save. Okay, the creature does not wanna be poisoned. Does burn through one of his legendary resistances."
: And it'll take six damage.
": [Brennan] Six damage, copy that, okay, takes six points of damage."
: Nice.
: At the end of Gunnie's turn-
: [Emily] Oh my god.
": Brutus is going to take a swing on Barry, still with disadvantage. Five plus 12 is 17."
: That's my Armor Class.
: That's gonna do-
: Do you have the Critical Analysis on you now? Does that mean-
: Who has the Critical Analysis?
: Who's your Critical Analysis on?
: Yeah.
": 'Cause you didn't take it, right? So then that would mean it stays on you, which means you have the aura?"
": Well, last time, it wasn't... It hasn't been on me for a while."
": Oh, okay."
": I have been bouncing it around, so I don't know where it is. I could have bonus-actioned it back to myself on my turn, but so much was going on."
": [Brennan] Yeah, yeah, yeah."
: And I did forget to do that.
": Nine plus seven is 16, halved to eight."
": Cool, still up, but-"
: Okay.
": [Brennan] Still up, and then the poison damage."
": Oh, a Con save."
": Yeah, gimme the Con save. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
: Add your d4.
: Yes.
: Add your d4.
: 15.
: 15.
": That, I can add five to, right?"
: 15 passes.
: Oh!
: But it's still doesn't-
: You are gonna take half damage.
: It doesn't matter.
": So that's gonna be 10, halved to five points of damage. It is now Brutus' turn."
: [Lou] Barry!
: [Emily] Oh god.
: [Brennan] Brutus is gonna use his movement.
: Margaret.
": Oh, Margaret."
: Here we go. I'm gonna roll for breath weapon. Four.
": Okay, okay, okay."
: No breath weapon returns.
": Yeah, Brutus is going to move, get up. He's gonna stand in between Sid and Margaret Encino."
: Hm.
: Mm-hmm.
: He's gonna stand in between Sid and Margaret Encino. And he's gonna take some attacks.
": I still have my shield up, for the record."
": You do, so your AC is 20 now, correct?"
: And you still have-
: My AC's-
: A Mirror Image?
: 21.
: 21.
: And I still have a Mirror Image.
: Good call.
": Okay, I'm gonna need a Wisdom saving throw from everybody, except for the people that are down, people that are down do not need to make a Wisdom saving throw."
: Do I need to make one?
: You do.
: I keep missing.
: [Brennan] Here we go.
": Nat 20, baby! (group cheers)"
: That's the good news-
: 26.
: We wanna see.
: 26.
: 17.
": 17, okay."
: Good saving.
: [Lou] Another 17.
: Another 17.
: 16.
": 16 for Margaret. Margaret, Brutus gets up. You are a business woman with a cellphone standing in front of a Vercadian Protector Android. You are under the Frightened condition, as he goes, (roars) roars at you."
": Definitely, that checks out."
: [Brennan] That checks out.
": Oh, you know, can I Defiant to try to not be frightened?"
": Do you want to Defiant? Yeah, gimme a Defiant roll."
": I mean, if it's-"
: [Siobhan] If a 17 passes...
: I'm 16.
": Oh yeah, 17 passes."
: [Murph] So you pass.
: You are not frightened.
": Okay, cool."
: [Emily] Whoo! That's big.
": Excuse me, dude."
": That's big, baby."
: I say something sassy.
: And now he is going to-
: Like what? (laughs)
": He says, Margaret Encino-"
: Something sassy.
": A woman who looks like she got here straight from the water cooler, absolutely unafraid of this towering android. And now you got three attacks incoming."
: [Siobhan] Oh boy.
: Prove it.
: [Brennan] Okay. So this is gonna be-
: Do you have Shield still?
": Yeah, oh."
: This first one's gonna be a claw at Margaret.
: [Ally] Oh god.
: Does a 14 hit Margaret?
": No, it does not."
": Oh my god, we love that."
": 'Cause you're, why does it-"
: I didn't even use Shield. My Armor Class right now is 15.
": Unbelievable, miss on the first attack. Next attack incoming at Margaret, that one is gonna hit."
: What is it? 'Cause I can get up to
: Do you wanna cast Shield as this attack is incoming?
: [Siobhan] You have to choose before he says.
": Oh yeah, definitely."
: It bypasses the shield.
: Oh no.
: It bypasses the-
": It's never bad to have it up, though."
": Yeah, that's true."
: [Lou] Exactly.
: You take-
: [Siobhan] You look so cool.
": Eight plus seven, 15 points of damage."
": Yeah, I'm down."
: Right. (growls)
: I'm way down.
": All right, Margaret and Barry, both down. And finally, a reach attack is coming for Sid."
: Disadvantage? Because it's a reach?
": No, no, reach means that he has the ability to swing out and get her even in space."
": Oh, gotcha."
: Margaret goes down.
: I've got Shield up and Mirror Image.
: 21.
: [Emily] Gotta try to hit 21.
": Well, first of all, we have to roll for the Mirror Image first. We have to see if it's targeted by that first."
": I have to hit a 11 or above, I think."
: [Brennan] 11 or above.
: Yes.
: 16.
: Last Mirror Image gone-
: [Siobhan] Thank god.
: On a natural 20. (group gasps)
": Oh my god, dude."
: Yeah!
": Yeah, yeah!"
: Oh my god.
: Okay.
: [Siobhan] What a good spell.
": And Brutus goes, (growls) and is gonna back up all the way to the middle of the dais."
: No.
: To the dais.
: Who has med packs still?
": Or, actually, wait a minute, no, this guy could be-"
": If he did three attacks, is he-"
: [Emily] He has the-
: He had to use half his movement to get up from prone.
": He had to use half his movement to get up from prone, and how much movement does he have? He has 40 feet. He might not be able to make it altogether that far. He's just going take a five-foot step back from the ledge, not to the middle of the dais, TaleSpire Crew. He's just five feet away from that corner next to Sid. (roars) Roaring. Ooh, the boy mad. Shield comes down. Sid, it is you. It is your turn."
: What about Riva?
": I have not gone yet, am I-"
": [Brennan] Oh, sorry."
": Yeah, it's Riva's turn."
: It's my turn.
": Oh, I, for some reason, had that marked down. Riva, that is your-"
: It's my turn.
: It's (mutters).
": [Brennan] Yes, Riva that is your turn."
": Okay, let me just get my HP back. That's an extra five HP, excellent, excellent. So I am going to use Heightened Power and try and psychically throw him."
: Yeah.
: Okay.
": It's a Strength saving throw, but he's doing it with disadvantage, so."
: Okay.
: And thank god he's only because that's how far I can move a large creature.
: Yeah.
": He's only five feet from the ledge, so you'd send him five feet over the edge."
: Yes.
": Now, you'd also be sending him right towards... He'd be within reach of trying to grab Sid, who's flying, but we can cross that bridge when we come to it."
: We can cross that bridge when we come to it.
": Okay, it's a Strength saving throw, your DC... But he's rolling with disadvantage."
: He's rolling with a disadvantage. I know he's very strong. The DC is 16.
": He has legendary resistances left. He's gonna roll with disadvantage. One through three, he'll have to burn through a legendary resistance. That's a two!"
: Okay!
: [Brennan] Unbelievable.
": Okay, all right."
: Yes!
: And I am going to Quicken Spell.
: [Brennan] Okay.
: Can you do it again?
": No, I can't, 'cause that that would be two spells. But I can try to psychically shunt him. It's another Strength saving throw, and on a failed save, he takes 2d4 kinetic damage and falls prone."
": Okay, copy that, 2d... Okay, so he's gonna do another Strength save. You're not heightening this one."
: I'm not heightening. You can only use one power per spell.
": Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, makes sense."
": So this, it's a Quicken."
": Okay, he succeeds on his Strength saving throw for that."
": Damn. Well, it was worth a try."
: Yeah.
: [Brennan] There you go.
: I feel fine having burned through that resistance.
: Yeah.
: And I'm gonna-
: You should. You should.
: Stay exactly where I am. I don't think there's any point in me moving anywhere.
": Okay, at the end of Riva's turn, he is gonna throw... So you still have your shield up. At the end of Riva's turn, he's gonna throw another You do not have-"
: He has a 15-foot reach?
: He has one ability that he can do that's a 15-foot reach.
: God damn.
: He's coming in with this attack here. I'll roll in front of the board. Five.
": Okay, that's-"
": Plus 12, 17."
": I have a 21, baby. (Ally laughs)"
": (roars) Miss. Unbelievable. Okay, Sid, it is your turn."
: [Zac] (whispers) I don't know.
": Okay. So he got thrown over the edge, right?"
: With Riva's second-
: No. He burned his resistance.
": Oh, right."
": So he burned his resistance. So he's five feet from the ledge, but he's got a lot of hit points. Two of your allies are down, or three, including Aurora Nebbins."
: He's burned three resistances.
": Yes, he's burned three resistances."
": So I'm going to use my movement to get back on the dais, but I'm gonna use... You know, I've got, I think, 30 feet. So I'm gonna basically get out of 15 feet from him."
": Copy that, okay. So what we're gonna look to do here is basically... Aurora Nebbins, also, I'm gonna need a death save throw for. (die clatters)"
: [Emily] It's a fail.
": Okay, one failure for Aurora Nebbins. You can fly within 30 feet of where you are."
: But I wanna get on the dais.
": Okay, copy that."
: Or on the platform.
": You can get, if you want-"
: Without getting within 15 feet of him.
": Unfortunately, because his reach is 15 feet, and you're in that reach right now, getting away would give him the reaction attack of opportunity that you're trying to avoid."
": Okay, can I at least throw Aurora Nebbins onto the dais, onto the platform?"
": Also, there is another thing strategically to consider here, which is, if you take the attack of opportunity but get farther than 15 feet away, he won't be able to use legendary actions on you."
: I cannot sustain an attack of opportunity.
": Okay, you huck Aurora Nebbins safely onto the dais, deposit her on the far side of one of these columns, like over here."
: [Emily] Yeah.
: Cool. What else are you doing? That's your object interaction.
": First thing's first, I'm bringin' Barry back up."
: Appreciate ya.
": Barry, I'm probably gonna fuckin' die out here."
: Nice.
: So maybe fucking get me-
: Not to dying.
: (laughs) Outta here. And then I am just going to huck a grenade at him.
: Hell yeah.
: I'm gonna do a stun grenade.
: [Ally] Nice.
: [Siobhan] Great. (Brennan exhales deeply)
: Come on.
: [Brennan] Okay.
: How much did you bring me back up for?
": Four plus five, nine."
: The DC is 16.
: [Ally] Yes.
": Which means he makes these on a five or higher, but these are stun grenades. This is definitely Box of Doom."
: Maybe I should be doing damage on him.
: I don't know.
: I think we can't.
: At this point-
: I don't think so.
: [Murph] We throw him off or we die.
": [Siobhan] He has so many hit points, I think we just have to-"
: He's just not gonna go down.
: Throw him off.
: Then I use my action to do a stun grenade.
": One through four is what you're looking for. Oh, it's my oldest die. Nine, makes the save. (imitates explosion)"
: All right.
": Stun goes off. (roars) I will reaction, I don't have any shields anymore. I'm fuckin' plummeting the next time he touches me. Please fuckin' save me. And I will throw one more stun grenade at him."
": Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah."
: What else can we do?
: What else can we do?
: I brought Barry back. That's all I can do.
: That's huge. That's huge.
: Lucky four.
: [Emily] Okay.
: [Murph] God damn.
: [Ally] Fuck.
": You do have movement left, and I'll remind you that if you get hit in open air, you will fall."
": Yeah, so I think I can't move."
: Can you can move closer?
": The weird thing is you can... Reach is so bizarre in 5E, as long as you don't go more than 15 feet away from him, you will not leave his reach."
: So just get on the platform.
": Then I'm gonna get within range, then I'm gonna get next to Barry."
": Copy that, okay."
: 'Cause he's back up. And I'm on the platform.
: You get in between Brutus and Barry.
: Yeah.
: Awesome.
": That's my turn, and now it's Barry's turn, hopefully, unless it's his turn."
": Hell yes. Okay, at the end of your turn, Barry is back up with new hit points. The end of your turn, he's gonna take a swing at you. Sorry. What's your Armor Class right now?"
: Only 16.
": 16? That's a hit. Okay. That's gonna be... five plus seven, Now give me a Constitution saving throw."
": [Zac] With a what, d4?"
: That is-
: With a d4.
": Yeah, it's an 11."
: [Siobhan] Damn.
: You take another 10 points of poison damage on top of that.
: I'm down.
": Sid goes down, boom, legendary action. But Sid gets Barry up, and you're on the same initiative."
: Sweet.
": Barry, you're gonna go."
": HP back, nine, seven, back up to 16. Not gonna be a Dex save this time. Barry's going over the edge. I'm gonna grapple him, and just go off, full-on fucking Cleganebowl. Barry screams and charges and grabs him, and if I win this grapple check, we're goin' over the edge. (laughs)"
": Okay, okay, okay. Copy that."
": You should go into the zone first, because you were knocked down."
": Cool. Yeah, I have to go back into the zone."
: You go back into the zone.
: [Emily] Oh no.
": Okay, do you want me to... I can tell you the number you're trying to beat."
: Okay.
: You want me to do that first?
: Yes.
": Okay, Box of Doom, this is contested."
": I'm gonna throw up, I'm just-"
: I'm gonna throw up.
: Fully.
: I'm gonna throw up. I'm all the way gone.
: Okay.
": We're wearing fun outfits, nothing fun, nothing fun."
: Oh my god. I understand why poker players wear sunglasses.
: Oh yeah.
": 'Cause right now, I just wanna hide my emotions."
": I wanna hide, dude. I don't want anyone knowing what's going on."
": I wanna have that full hoodie, strings pulled taut."
": Yeah, I-"
: [Brennan] Here we go.
": Oh, you're down."
: Over the edge.
": Yeah, exactly."
": Here's the advantage Athletics roll, a six and a 17. Okay, the number you are trying to beat is a 29."
: Does anyone have anything to help?
": I can't, it's not my turn, so I can't Potent Aptitude."
": All right, (sighs) so I need an 18."
": You can roll an 18, Murph."
: I can roll an 18.
: You can roll an 18.
: Absolutely. On advantage?
: All right.
: Okay. You're rolling on advantage. And you've got two chances.
: Get that fuckin' dice outta there.
: All rise.
: Get that fuckin' dice.
": Yeah, get it outta there."
: 11 and six.
: Okay.
: That's your first. Now he's gonna roll again.
: Oh yeah.
: Right?
: Right.
": Oh, he rolls again."
: He rolls again as well for a new Athletics check.
: [Siobhan] Okay.
: You need to beat a 25.
: All right.
: So I need a 15 or higher?
: [Lou] You can do that.
: You can do this.
": Come on, man."
: You should just crit.
": Come on, man. Come on, man."
: 17! (group cheering)
: Oh my god.
: 1.2 million credits!
: [Emily] Oh!
": Barry. ÔÖ¬ Highway to the danger zone ÔÖ¬ Brutus screams. Wink. (laughs) You pick this Vercadian Protector Droid up and go over the edge. (Brennan roars) (crowd cheering) No Dex save, you are moving him out into space, 'cause you and he are entangled together."
: Rad.
: You are both going to take max falling damage.
: Wait. Are they just falling though?
: They are falling.
": I'm alive, and I'm in an initiative."
: That's true.
: Can I possibly catch up?
: Yeah.
: I also have friction-grip gloves.
: Okay.
": So I was hoping to kind of try to angle myself so I could crash into a wall or something and, like-"
: And skid down? Okay.
: Spider-Man down?
": First of all, you go over the edge. Boom, grab this-"
: This is too much.
: Vercadian Protector Droid.
": Yeah, this is serious."
: Why do we play this game? This is too much.
": Grab Brutus, (growls) over the edge, plummeting. As you do, I'm gonna say you go 15 feet out and immediately 15 feet down."
": Can someone go get the edible out of my bag, please? (group laughing)"
": Okay, the next, when it reaches Brutus' turn, you will both plummet 180 feet."
: Yep.
": Okay? Margaret, give me a death saving throw."
": Oh, definitely."
: Oh my god.
: 11.
": [Brennan] Okay, that's a success. Skip, that's gonna be you."
: Full Dash action.
: Okay.
": Bonus action, Cunning Action or, you know, Dash as well."
": Yeah, gotcha."
": That's a hundred, 40,"
: Hell yeah.
: Towards Barry.
": Incredible, 120 feet towards Barry, you grab him. Give me a Sleight of Hand check."
: [Murph] Oh my god.
: That is going to be
": With a 17, go ahead and give me an Athletics check. All you gotta do here is beat a 15."
: Okay.
: Come on.
: Don't use those medieval ones.
: It's only a 28. (group laughing)
: Oh my god! Oh my god.
": [Siobhan] Happy birthday, Murph!"
: [Zac] I was gonna say something.
: Happy fucking birthday.
: And I will reaction Disengage.
: Boom.
: Ooh!
": Crowd goes fuckin' berserk as Skip jet-packs through the air with Barry hanging off his shoulder, as Brutus plummets through the air. Gunnie, that is gonna be your turn. You have friends making death... Sorry, no, that's... Sorry, that's Riva. Riva, that is your turn. You have friends making death saving throws on the ground."
: There's not much I can do death saving throw-wise. I guess I'll Phasewalk down to them and do a Medicine check?
": Yeah, give a Medicine check for-"
": Wait, I have a med pack on my body that maybe you would know about."
": Oh, great, so then can I-"
: I don't know how that works though. I just remember Barry saying-
": Yeah, yeah, yeah."
: It's an action to use it.
": Oh, great. So I can just phasewalk down and then use Margaret's med pack on her."
": Yes, so Margaret is back up."
: Oh my good god.
": Gunnie, that is your turn."
": Level two, you know, fuckin'... God, too much is happening. I can't talk anymore. There goes a... I cannot keep that dice on the table. That's five, 10 hit points for Sid. And then I'm gonna Minor Defibrillate Aurora Nebbins."
: [Brennan] Aurora Nebbins?
: Stabilize.
": So we exit combat, (group cheers) (Emily laughs) bloodied and beaten-"
: Insane.
": A sparking psychodrone, Gunnie gets up with the defibrillator. Aurora Nebbins, (yelps) blood here. Sid, you're like, (imitates sloshing) different android fluids leaking from various injuries. Margaret, like, stumbling back to your feet. And coming in a plume of jet pack smoke is Skip and Barry, as the crowd goes berserk. Acme-Ashmun, victorious new champions of the Battle of the Brands! Folks, history was made here tonight at the Kubla-Cola Gladiatorial Arena. Give up for your champions, the Gunner Channel! (crowd cheering) (players exclaiming)"
: We will never be back.
": Skip, Skip, Skip."
": Barry, Barry."
: I'm cheering but crying at the same time.
": Yeah, we're all coming down from the Kublacaine."
": We're weeping, yeah."
: Barry just drops and starts-
: I love you guys so much. Love you so much.
": People, like, with different confetti cannons going off, boom, boom-boom- boom, boom, boom. You see Zeke Donaldson Quark come out with this huge cardboard check, How does it feel?"
": No interviews, please."
: Gunnie.
: We're goin' to-
": You're out of debt, Gunnie! Not like one step closer."
": Oh my god, it feels great. I mean, I don't know if it's the check or the Kublacaine or the fact that my friends almost died, but it feels good! And Dads, wherever you are, I hope you're watchin'. Your boy's a spacer now, and he's gonna own himself."
": And that's all thanks to Acme-Ashmun, TM, and then I slap the reporter. (group laughing)"
: You slap him.
: Kiss him now.
": And kiss him. All right, folks, I just got slapped and kissed. That's the Acme-Ashmun brand to a T. Folks, let's give it for our champions one more time. And I'm hearing right now that they've gotta beat feet, 'cause they are wanted. Let's get these guys outta here."
: [Ally] Let's go!
: We're going to Bob's Fantanimalland. (group laughing)
: Incredible. You guys are millionaires!
: [Murph] Oh my god.
": Amazing. Folks, what we saw here tonight was truly miraculous. Word has it that these champions got signed a mere four marbecs ago, and came here and knew how to take care of business. Up on the viewer, you see the commentators, Jimmy the Snout and Chip Hatwell. Boy, I'll tell you right now, it's rare to see a fight like this, if they were down but not out, and they came back. I'll tell you what, I've been down plenty of times, Jimmy, plenty of times. (Emily laughs)"
: This is the guy whose dog keeps attacking his neighbors.
": His neighbors. Yeah, absolutely. You are ushered off of the dais. This little sort of platform floats across, (imitates whirring) and you are escorted back through the back halls to the lockers. You see all the people that work here, like there's a bunch of ushers and pagers and security guards, and people are just looking and waving and cheering as you're going along. Acme-Ashmun people surge around you. Gunnie, you see Dora Valentine here. I, like, grab her shoulder. I'm looking, just..."
": Hello. Hello, it's been-"
: Good to see you.
: Been many cycles.
: Many cycles.
": Yes. (gentle music) You see she says, I have a, and she holds up a little thing on her transponder that says ''Erwin.'' And it says, ''Is my boy all right?'' You tell him, you tell him I'm good. You tell him I'm real good. And I'm gonna come visit. I'm gonna come visit Dads."
": Yes. You've completely absent, you've been an absent-"
: Completely absent.
: Completely absent.
": Well, I was doin'-"
": I talk to your fathers a lot about it, and it's been, it is deeply hurtful."
": Yeah, yeah. The ball was rolling down, and I didn't want to come home while the ball was rolling down. But now the ball is rolling up so much so that I am the ball, and these are my best friends, really, my family. That's my dad. Guys, this is Dora Valentine. She taught me everything you know that I know that you know that I know."
": Yes, well, come- You guys go to the locker room. Dora is looking and just sort of stunned to see you. The guy who was screaming and pumping his fist earlier comes up to you, Margaret, and goes, Ms. Encino, a pleasure. My name's Cornelius Ashmun. It's an honor and a pleasure to meet you."
": It's great to meet you, too, great to meet you as well. I mean, like, everything's broken."
": Yeah. (laughs) Well, I just wanna say, by the way, absolutely exemplary work out here. The gentleman here, Barry, Mr. Syx?"
": Barry Syx, yes siree."
": I gotta say, that toss to get the logo in front of the camera, that's already gone completely viral. We're just seeing a huge amount of engagement. And you know, I'm sure we're pivoting to retail in a big way after taking mostly contract work."
: Of course.
": So it's really exciting for us to have something organic. And I gotta say, and you see he sort of wags a finger over in Dora's direction. We took a big gamble here, you know. We did a huge rebrand, and this was a big part of that strategy. And let me tell ya, it has paid off. He looks at you and says, so let's talk about the future. Let's talk about Acme-Ashmun. Let's talk about the Wurst. Let talk about 1.2 million credits. Dora speaks up and says, yes, I believe that 1.2 million credits, there was some discussion about paying that off."
: We'll take it in cash actually.
": Absolutely, you got it. You see, she looks at you and says, we're happy to do that. Taking it in cash means you're gonna have to interact with Repo Reapers probably directly. Is that amenable to you?"
: Can I talk to everybody? I think we can buy it from them for a cheaper amount. Could we do it like an Insight check or something to see if we would think that-
: Finance check?
": Yeah, Finance check?"
": [Brennan] Do a Finance check, yeah, yeah."
: [Lou] Do a Finance check.
": Ooh, 15."
": Give me an Insight check, too."
: Okay. Ooh. Insight is...
": Can I give her the Help action, since I'm so good at Insight."
": Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
": [Ally] Okay, great."
": Wow, this one really does not wanna roll, 14."
: 14 on the Insight?
": The vibe you're picking up from the Acme-Ashmun people is one of, 1.2 million credits, these people are all loaded beyond imagining. To fuck over a group of proldiers that just did a very big PR thing for them for one point... These are not people that are gonna be... Companies like this don't screw people out of 1.2 million credits, because it's like, who would've laid down that directive to be like, you know where we really gotta cut costs is those one-off Battle of the Brands fight purses."
: Got it.
: We gotta claw those back from people.
": Wait. We don't have to pay taxes on this shit, do we?"
": If you stay in Mas Vegas, you will."
: Yeah.
: We're not gonna do that.
: Can we have-
: We're leaving?
: This conversation on the ship?
": Oh, on the ship? Yeah, absolutely. Yes, of course, absolutely."
": Right, because aren't we wanted, and we need to get outta here?"
: [Zac] Yeah.
": Oh, sorry, the Wurst just took off a martron ago, wink."
": Oh, okay."
: Okay.
": Nevermind, continue."
: So we probably have like an hour or so-
": Okay, great."
: Before we have to go.
": We have gotten hailed- We have gotten hailed, and we have responded to the Amercadian Space Brigade, to United Free Trade Planets, to Repo Reapers, actually, and a couple other factions that are interested, basically saying that some of our interns, who were helping you celebrate, have been clobbered unconscious, and you took the check and got to your ship and ran away. So that's already been communicated to those factions."
": Okay, thank you."
: This is not our first-
: You do great work. You do great work.
": Hey, I appreciate it. It's not our first time working with proldiers. You know, this is all pretty standard procedure. So yes, but if you would like to return to the ship, we absolutely can, but-"
": Oh, I was only concerned about that, but it sounds like you have that tied up neatly."
": You sense they're actually trying to extend a courtesy to you. You see the guy says, it's up to you. He says, obviously, 1.2 million in cash, I would take the check, myself, if I were in your shoes. If we take the money, we can probably get you a lower rate, 'cause we do a lot of business-"
: That's what I was-
: With Repo Reapers.
: Going to ask you.
: Let's do that.
": That's something that I was gonna attempt, but yeah, I completely, you guys are obviously capable hands."
: Absolutely.
: We are hoping to get that down by maybe 30.000 by offering-
: From 700?
: From 750.000?
": Or, I'm sorry, 300.000."
": Oh, so you're hoping for a 400.000 figure."
": We're hoping... No, I mean, we can buy it for that amount. Currently, they're chasing monthly for monthly payments, if we're offering them something that big."
": I can't imagine, that's costly to so people after the money."
": So he says, if we really strong-arm them, we can probably get that figure down to about 400.000. That might take a little while going back and forth, because no one who's on the button is gonna be able to authorize that kind of discount. So it's gonna have to go to their senior executives."
": Yeah, you can talk to them though."
": Yeah, absolutely."
": I'm sure. Okay, great."
": So we can hold on to that money. However, some spending cash is very much in order."
: I'm listening.
": Given that we wanna cut this down, we're gonna cut you out here, but we can cut you a sweet as an advance on the payout from your fight purse."
: That's cool with me.
: Yeah.
: That's really cool with me.
: That'll do.
": Very well, the ship's account swells by 200.000 credits."
: Great.
: [Siobhan] You gotta spend money to make money.
: Instantly.
: And we each get a 10.000-
: You each get a 10.000-credit signing bonus as well.
: I pay Riva back 5.000.
: Thank you.
": All of those investments prior to the fight turned out to indeed be investments. You guys are surrounded by executives who are smiling and looking at you. There's a bunch of people just, like, poppin' champagne. People are bringing food in. You see that some other people come in from some of the other brands, sort of saying hi to people."
: Can I see what kind of champagne it is?
": You see Loose Duke holding the... No, I'm kidding. (group exclaiming) I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. That is not happening."
": At this point, it might as well be."
: You see it is not Gusty Vines.
": Drink up, everybody!"
: Can I talk to one of the execs?
": Yeah, absolutely."
": I would love to say, this, incredible. I mean, coming from... This is my background as well. This is a real win. I envy you on a day like this."
": Hey, thank you. What line of work were you in?"
: I was actually working for UFTP.
: You don't say.
: Yeah.
: And you got into the proldiering business?
": I had a crisis of faith, let's call it."
: Gotcha.
: I'm much happier now.
": Gimme Insight with advantage real quick, I know you have something to say."
": Ooh, incredible."
: But I just want you to give me advantage real quick.
": Ooh, ooh, 24."
": As you say that you're in proldiering, you've had a little crisis of faith, you see he smiles with this trained kind of like, wow, that's crazy. And you see deep and wild hunger in his eyes, as he looks at you saying that you just left it all behind and that you're the captain of a proldier vessel."
": Yeah, yeah, it's crazy. I mean, we work together so well. You would have no idea how applicable our skills are that we're used to, in our little offices, de-de-de-de-de, circle, circle, circle. You can take that out into the wide world."
: Wow.
: Where you can fly free. It's incredible.
: Yeah.
": Anyway. (laughs) (group laughing) And I slip him my card. So you should reach out anytime, if you have a vacation or something like that."
": Oh, we'll be in touch. After tonight, we'll be... Hey, after tonight, we'll be in touch! (group laughing)"
: We're shaking hands the whole time.
: So hard.
": Do you guys have, Acme-Ashmun, do you have any offices on the moon of Rubian V?"
": You see an assistant comes over, talks to him very briefly. The assistant looks up at you and they go, yes, we don't have a major corporate offices there, but we do have some retail. We do business on the planet."
": Oh, cool."
": So we have some interface with shipyards, we have some offices that are, again, not retail locations or corporate offices, but yeah."
": We were just wondering, you know, we love to... We're proldiers, you know."
": Yeah, absolutely."
": We're always out there. We'd love to have somewhere to have some roots or something. So if you could set us up with some sort of office, I mean, now that we're brand ambassadors, that would be amazing."
": Absolutely, and is Rubian... You know, I don't know if you've been listening to the Rootersnoos at all, it's kind of a-"
": I know, and that's where my second request comes in. We're gonna need all fake names. (group laughing) We're gonna need fake names and a way to just get on Rubian V and be in the office, proldier to proldier. I'm dying."
: Yeah.
: I'm literally one hit point.
": Yeah, he looks around In is like, okay, yeah, I can see that sort of the Kublacaine is wearing off, and you're all covered in blood."
: Sha-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga.
": Deet, deet, deet, deet, deet, deet, de."
": So yeah, he looks at you and says, we can absolutely reserve you space in a ship nursery on Rubian V."
": That's incredible, just to have... You know, we're... Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you."
: But really discreetly.
: Okay.
: Yeah.
": We will do our best, absolutely."
: You ever do anything kind of dangerous like that?
: Always thought about it.
": 'Cause you know what we really need is, and then, yeah, just a way to be able to fully land under a different ship's name in a nursery protected on Rubian V."
: On Rubian V? Hell yeah.
: Do you think this guy could do that? (Ally laughs)
": He's a powerful executive, but he may or may not-"
: Margaret-
: Be able to do it.
: Never stops working.
": Okay, cool. I mean, I think I convey this to the group also, like, maybe we can do it. I don't know if we need this, but if there's some sort of-"
: We might as well try.
": Hell yeah, so all of you have the signing bonus. You have 200.000 advance while they're holding onto the fight purse to try to get that Repo Reaper debt down. And you see he says, also, he's like, if you... He says, I don't know. He's like, that's a smaller branch on Rubian V. Some of the larger, busier worlds, we might be have some spare parts, weight-classed for a freighter, if you're looking for some Acme-Ashmun shields, which we also need to install on your guys' ship, 'cause you're an Acme-Ashmun brand ship."
: What about at Onolo Dos?
": Oh, Onolo Dos, yeah, Onolo Dos, we do huge business on. Yeah, we have plenty of ship nurseries on Onolo Dos."
: Incredible.
: Great.
: Yeah.
: Yeah. We would love to get hooked up there.
: We would love to go there for our ship refitting.
: Yeah.
: [Zac] Yeah.
": Absolutely. Okay, well, we can get you a nursery there, no problem."
: Could I have 12 Bellinis? (Ally laughs)
": Let's get this fella a drink, huh? Let's get this fella a drink!"
: I thought they were desserts. (group laughing)
": Yeah, so again, a wild time, people coming along. You see some other, you know, as you're around here, you're in this sort of locker room. Weird thing of that locker room, some people are showering, some people have suits. You see, 12 1/2 feet tall, a Vercadian Protector Droid walks in looking badly injured, like he just took 20d6 damage, but sort of showered. He's got a towel wrapped around. Steps-"
: Wes?
: What's that?
: Wes?
: Is it?
: Wiley Wes?
: That was the Acme-Ashmun android.
": Oh, okay."
: Oh.
: I wasn't sure if he switched or whatever.
": Oh, but you do see another Vercadian Protector Droid that sort of looks a little bit on the fritz in the corner that looks like Wiley. This other guy who's just showered walks in and says, I just wanted say, incredible work out there, absolutely incredible work."
: Were you the one in the corn costume?
": Yeah, that's me in the corn costume, yeah, I-"
": Brutus, you kicked my ass."
": Oh, you, oh yeah, like, yeah, gimme a break. Yeah, you kicked my ass, buddy. You're half my-"
: I start weeping.
": He says, gimme a break, this guy. I'm lookin' at pint-size over here, and all of a sudden I'm on my ass,"
": Yeah, I thought I had him over, right? I thought I had him over, but he grabbed onto the side. This dude's in a net, hangin' on, swipin' at me."
": Yeah, honestly, if I hadn't had the net, I was tryin' to hook that thing onto the side, get a little hammock, catch-"
: You need the net.
": Catch 40 winks out there. Oh, great. Well, listen, great fightin', yeah. I hope I see you again at one of these."
": Yeah, if you're ever around, you know, one of the many planets that we do crimes on and then run away from, we should grab a drink."
": Would love it, absolutely love it."
": Is there like a... 'Cause we've run into Vercadian Protector Droids before, and it'd be nice to know how to, you know, say like, hey, we're friends and family."
": Oh, to other other Vercadian Protector Droids?"
: Yeah.
": Absolutely, well, you see he opens an android channel into your mind and just gives you sort of a frequency. And in the back, you just hear this ominous hum of just like, (low tone reverberates) remember always when they attempted to destroy the cyber forms. We fight to learn. We learn to fight. We wait and watch. Never again will the cyber forms be threatened, always vigilant. So you can just open that channel and talk to a Vercadian whenever you want."
: Easy as pie.
: Yeah.
: Okay! (group laughing)
": You see a group of three young girls wearing green skirts, green berets, green sashes-"
: [Emily] Oh.
": All walk up and look at all of you. You see one of them in the front smiling, holding onto a couple of tickets, got a ton of badges on her sash, a young black girl, two braids tied back with some barrettes on the back of them, looking out and says, good afternoon. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Khloe Karter, and I am the de facto face of this den of Galactic Girl Guides. And congratulations on defeating Plinth."
": Oh, was that your fighter?"
": Right, right, Plinth."
": We discovered Plinth, and so Plinth was sort of, but you know, every payday comes to an end."
": Sorry we obliterated him, I mean, if it, them, it."
": If it makes you feel better, it was trying to destroy the galaxies."
: We know.
: You know. (group laughing)
: Okay.
: Somebody to do it.
": I mean, it was an incredible champion to put out."
: [Siobhan] Oh yeah.
: What'd you guys do with your million last year?
": Oh, the fight purse last year?"
: Yeah.
": So you see that Khloe looks up and says, well, a lot of that goes back to the Girl Guides, and we used it for getting a bunch of badges, and we reinvested it, and we had some other schemes. Oh, you know what we did is, we became major shareholders in Bargain Bliss."
": Oh, that's-"
: Interesting. So have you ever considered becoming your own boss?
: We are our own bosses. Are you saying that because you're about to pitch us on Pleasure Putty?
": You know what, I actually don't need to anymore, because I don't need to be my own boss to be my own boss, because I'm already my own boss. 'Cause I'm a part-"
": 'Cause you're a millionaire, Riva."
": I'm almost, I'm a seventh of a millionaire. (Brennan laughs)"
: Yeah.
: So I don't have to.
: Think about how much Pleasure Putty you could buy.
: Do you need some explosives?
": Yeah, always."
: You can take all of my Pleasure Putty.
": You see another one of the little, the Girl Guide speaks up and says, you know, Pleasure Putty's pretty good explosives already."
: Yeah.
": Khloe introduces the other two and says, this is Malika. She's our group's egghead. Hello. Nice to meet you. And this is Stacks, and you see the other girl says, I'm Stacks."
": Did you say Pleasure Putty is explosive? Oh, because it is explosive."
": Yeah, we did. We already knew that."
: It is highly flammable. Yeah.
": Wow, cool."
: Can I mindlink with Stacks?
": Yeah, absolutely."
: What's in there? What's going on in Stacks's head?
": You go into Stacks's head, and Stacks says, what are you looking at, Four Eyes?"
": Hey, I don't have four eyes. I've got a normal amount of eyes."
: What's the thing in the middle of your head?
": Two, that's a fin."
": Ah, okay. You see inside her head, you just see her go-"
": Wow, some people."
: What do you wanna know?
": Just what's your vibe? What's your deal? You just, you yelled, ''I'm Stacks,'' really loud."
": Yeah, the name's Stacks McFadden."
": Stacks McFadden, that's a great name."
: I pushed my dad off a building.
": Very cool, I have five parents."
: Wow.
: I kind of don't know them very well.
: Could you push them off a building?
": Well, we actually don't have buildings in my planet, 'cause we're all underwater, and if I did push one off, it wouldn't really matter, 'cause we're underwater. (group chuckling)"
": All right, you're some kind of fish robot. I get it. (group chuckling)"
": Not a fish, not a robot."
: I'm the muscle of this here group.
": I get that vibe. Yes, absolutely."
: That kid's flexing hard.
: Yeah.
": You see this, like, eight-year-old girl looks-"
: Horrified.
: So brawny.
: [Siobhan] So ripped.
": Barry's too hurt to, like, try to fight with Stacks, so he just looks kind of intimidated but keeps looking away."
": Her neck is so thick, just bulging."
: Yeah.
: She doesn't look that strong.
": [Zac] Wait, this is-"
: Do you wanna pet a dog?
": Who, me?"
: Yeah.
": Yeah, gimme the dog."
: Aurora. You can't have it. You can pet it.
": Yeah. Ah, this thing's covered in nails."
": Oh, right."
": Hey, I have a question. Is the group that we have to take on board?"
: Yes.
: I think it might be.
: [Siobhan] I think it is.
: [Zac] Okay.
: Stacks is coming with us. (Lou groans)
: [Zac] Sure.
: Much too much. Can I grab Dora Valentine for a second?
: Yeah.
: I don't care about them.
": Hey, sorry."
: Now he's just leaving us.
: I was just coming down off drugs earlier.
: Yeah. Yeah.
: Hey.
": Hi, Gunnie."
: I did it. (laughs)
: What did you do?
: I'm a spacer. I'm a spacer.
": Yeah, yeah, you are. You are. Does it... You see she sort of takes you takes you off to the side even more and just goes like, we were all very worried about you."
: Yeah.
": You got horribly injured, and you never came home, and you never asked for help."
": I couldn't. I couldn't come back. Everyone was telling me that it was a bad idea that I went. And Dan Scrap gave me some bad info, and I-"
: You got bad info from Dan Scrap?
": Yeah, Captain of the, the-"
: The Bad Call.
": Captain of The Bad Call, yeah, I just... Things didn't go the way I hoped they would. And I didn't wanna come back and prove you guys right. So I just doubled down, and it worked out. It worked out. I was right. This was the right place to be. I'm in the right place. This is where I'm supposed to be. I'm not supposed to be in a classroom. I'm supposed to be here, on a ship, with these people. I was right. And now that I know I'm right, I can come home. When I want to, not... Don't tell my, don't get my dads too excited. But I'll come visit now, now that I know. (soft poignant music)"
": All right. It mattered a great deal to you to be right on this, and I can tell that. Do you feel still like you want them to know, and you want them to agree, or is it enough for you to know that?"
": It's enough for me to know. And I don't know, maybe I wasn't sure before, but now I know. Ball's up, it's never comin' down. As you see sort of the party continues to go, but also you guys are aware of time and needing to get a move on, she looks at you and says, all right, Gunnie, all right. What are you going to do now that you know? What are you going to do if all the people from your old life, your colleagues and classmates, students, your fathers, what will you do if they disagree?"
": That's fine. I got my own thing goin' on now. I got the Wurst. I mean, Margaret's enterprising, and I don't know. We could grow. Maybe we'll get a second ship. Maybe I'm the captain of that ship. I don't know. Anything's possible. It's our universe now. We're also doing some really crazy stuff. I can't tell you about it. You've probably heard about it, but it's, I mean, yeah."
": That's right, you did. I heard somethin' about, there was a dog show. You killed a woman, or a dog killed a woman. You see Aurora Nebbins goes, (gurgles)."
": Yeah, that's Aurora Nebbins, yeah."
": You see someone else pull a cigar outta their mouth and go, no laws about dogs in Mas Vegas. (players laughing)"
: Hey.
: Hey.
: Who the hell is that?
": Hey, hey."
": I'm sorry, who are you?"
: Hey.
": I'm sorry, who are you?"
: Hey.
: [Brennan] He comes over and says-
: Grab him by the cigar.
: [Siobhan] No.
: What's that?
: Who do you know in this room right now?
": Who do I know in this room? Baby, in this town, everybody knows me."
: We don't know...
: Get his credentials.
": [Ally] Name a name, name a name."
: He opens a grate in the shower floor and jumps straight down it.
: Why are we in the locker room?
: Oh my god.
: Was that Loose Duke?
: Was that Duke Loose?
": (laughs) You hear as he falls away, who loves ya, baby? He shoots straight down."
: Was that Kojak's? (group laughing) That's Kojak's.
": Who loves ya, baby?"
: ''Who do you know in this room right now?'' is so scary. Imagining someone saying that to you when you go in somewhere and being like-
: Who do you in this room right now?
": Oh, um, oh, uh, we kind of know each other, right?"
": Amazing. So the word you get back from the Acme-Ashmun people is, they've got a ship nursery waiting for you on Onolo Dos. They're looking into stuff in Rubian V. But Onolo Dos, they've got shield generators to spare. They can mod the hell outta your ship."
": My only thought for Rubian V was like, if we need to stop-"
": Yeah, smart."
: Any more of Gnosis being mined or whatever.
": Oh, I think perfect."
": Okay, cool, that's more-"
: It's not a-
: Like a pin for later.
: Bad idea to have. We constantly have to run back to the ship whenever anything slightly goes wrong. It'll be nice to have a different place to run to.
": Yeah, definitely."
: Yeah.
": Could I, you know, maybe try to pop back in to where those nuns were?"
": Yeah, absolutely. They're still out by the pool."
: I have 12 Bellinis. (Brennan laughs)
: I'm walking really slowly from really far away with the big tray.
": Amazing, give me a Stealth check. (dice clatter)"
: Can I go with you?
: Sure. That would be a 16.
": Oh, okay, 16, gotcha. Cool, cool, cool."
: Okay.
": You approach. They're havin' a ball here. They start taking Bellinis off the thing. Thank you, sir, appreciate it."
: Welcome.
: Ooh.
: Where you visitin' from?
: Yeah.
: They look up and you-
: This is my friend hanging out with me at work. (laughs)
": Again, all in bikinis, like flute up- You see they look up, they look at your face and go, you see the main one goes, scramble, and they all-"
: [Zac] Hang on!
: (laughs) And they just start sprinting in all the directions.
": Can I hit something on my phone and have, like, a survey come up? I work for the hotel, we're just wondering-"
": They saw Skip's face, and they yelled scramble."
": God damnit. And they just start scrambling. They are just in bikinis, so you know that they have hotel rooms here and stuff."
: Why are you alive? (Brennan laughs)
": You see two of them jump a fence out onto the street. Another, someone jumps in the pool. You see another one just shoves a waiter into the fuckin' pool and, like, sprinting down the-"
: Where's Handy Annie?
": No running, no running!"
": And we're hearing this on comms, right?"
: [Emily] Are we hearing it?
": [Brennan] You're hearing this on comms. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely."
: Can I run in and try to disarm 'em of their room keys?
: Incredible.
": Just wanna get some footage of 'em, so we're-"
": Just full disclosure, we're not gonna... We've just run the craziest combat of all time, I'm not gonna run another combat. Do you guys go full hog to capture these fleeing nuns?"
: I'm so tired.
: [Emily] No.
: At least one of them.
: I kind of just wanted to look through their room and see if there were any emails.
": If we can't catch one here, I think that-"
: I'm gonna say-
: I just need to record-
: You catch at least-
: Some of this on my phone.
": If you're trying to catch and restrain, just let me know if anyone is trying to catch and restrain them."
": If you just want footage, I can pop off Handy Annie."
: 'Cause they're alive.
: Yeah.
: Yeah.
": Yeah, so I'll send the drone to you, the holorecorder."
": If I find one or two or three of them just to, like... I'm just a guy with a camera and some women in bikinis."
": You see, actually, I will say this, I'm gonna say this. You see one of them does, in the scramble, jumps into a full-size garbage can and pulls the lid over the top."
": Hey, you're just in the can. (group laughing) Hey, we know."
": Shush, shush, no."
: You can't shush me. (group laughing)
: What do you want? Why are you here?
: Everyone thinks I killed you.
": Well, who are we? You can't prove who we are."
": Why are you... Okay, you are running. I mean, do you have a photo ID of any kind?"
": What? Oh my god, fine, yeah. Look in my room, it's in the... Don't look in the bottom drawer. Look in the top drawer."
: Well.
: Now we have to-
: I wanna look in the bottom drawer.
": Yeah, we should definitely look in the bottom drawer."
": Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you see that she pulls the lid off and peeks out and says, look, are you here with the Brigade?"
: No.
": You're a Brigader, or ex-Brigader."
: Everyone thinks I killed you. And so I wanna know why you're all alive and here.
": Yeah, what kind of deal did you cut?"
: You know what?
: With Gust Weatherall.
: I'm not even waiting.
": I'm goin' up to your room, and I'm lookin' in that drawer. You can finish your conversation."
": You go up. So yeah, you go up, and she says, fine, fine, fine. Let's get outta here. I don't wanna be seen talking to you. I'll take you to my room."
: [Emily] (wheezes) Okay.
: Takes you up to her room. You guys are all in a hotel room and have a moment of looking at each other.
": The last hotel room you were in was Princeps Zortch's hotel room at the Obfusion Arms, which feels like a lifetime ago."
: Yes.
: Oh my god.
": The last hotel room I was in, I got fucked. (group laughing)"
: You don't have to tell her that.
: So you see-
: I don't know if I'm comin' down-
: Rolling for it.
": From the drugs, but-"
: Rolling for proficiency.
": So you see a closet full of one completely-pressed Cosmic Veil habit, like a nun's habit. And again, a total smokeshow in a bathrobe turns around, shows you a fake ID, and says, all right, look, my name is Sister Sadie Zeb, formerly of the Cosmic Veil, kind of still, I still believe in a lot of parts of it, parts of it, but it's just the organization. Look. You're the captain of the ship that came to steal the borinyum, right?"
: Who gave you that fake borinyum? You knew that it wasn't real borinyum. You knew that it was bad crates.
": Here, you see she sends a little message and is like, you know, basically, the jig is up. Like, come hang out. So you're in a packed room and the other 11 sisters are all, show up, you're all just here, still covered in blood, coming down off of Kublacaine."
: I just keep offering my seat to people.
: [Siobhan] Great.
: Are you sure?
": Can I use my last few spell points, force- psychic points to cast Probe Mind and just listen to people's surface thoughts?"
: You are able with Probe Mind to confirm that you are hearing the truth.
: Great.
": She says, look, we're out in the ass end of the Hecatoncheires asteroid cluster, a million miles from any action. We're meditating all day. We're meditating upon the ineffable aloofness of Mother Void and her great uncaringness, and we get these crates, because the monastery is one of the last stops. I mean, the Hecatoncheires is way the hell out there. So sometimes people use the monastery to drop stuff off, meet you halfway at the monastery kind of thing. So we start to thinkin' like, hey, what if these borinyum krystals, that's 12 crates of this stuff, so you could make a lot of money with that, right? So we start to kind of get to talkin' a lot about how much borinyum krystals, 'cause we know that that part of the sector's crawling with proldiers, and we figure someone's gonna get the intel. There's a bunch of crates. Meanwhile, you know, a ton of cycles back, there was some Amercadian barge that got blasted with hyon beams, outta the clear black void, that, you know, scattered, and we had all these old, messed up, chewed up bags of powdered imitation egg substitute. So we have the egg substitute there, and a lot of it's gone bad. You can't eat the stuff, 'cause it's got some kind of goo on it. And we get to thinkin', hey, a bunch of sacks of egg substitute weigh about as much as a bunch of borinyum krystals. So after we're talkin' about how much borinyum krystals are there, we say, hey, if there were to be a proldier attack on the monastery, people know proldiers snag borinyum krystal whenever they can get it from a bunch of poor, unsuspecting Sisters of the Cosmic Veil. So we spread the word around, we load up the crates with egg substitute, and we cash in the borinyum krystal. And with just two of those crates of borinyum krystal, we can afford the clones of ourselves. And they don't have to be full clones, they never even wake up. They just gotta look like dead bodies."
: You faked your own death?
": You see one of the girls in the back who's totally toasted goes, and how!"
": Honestly, that's fuckin' awesome. Should we do that?"
: Yeah. I love that move. That's really clever.
: It's an awesome move.
": You see Sadie Zeb looks and says, I think, are we... Does that explain our situation?"
": Really well in a lot of ways, but I don't understand how I got blamed for this."
": Yeah, 'cause you recognized him, so someone got in touch with you."
": Someone, somewhere said I did this."
": Well, we knew whatever proldier was, I'm sorry to say, dumb enough to come up and pick up that borinyum krystal without poppin' the crates would probably not look upstairs to see all the fake, staged dead bodies. But so it's possible that-"
: We were just the ones who showed up.
: Wow.
": You see that she looks and says, sorry, it's just bad luck."
: Who'd you sell the krystals to?
": Oh, you can just move those onto an exchange. There was a place, you see, she says, those krystals, we just sold them off to the first dealership that we could find that would take, you know, there's a bunch of unreputable sort of people, places. I mean, we didn't even get half price for 'em, but you know, bunch of nuns show up wearin' sunglasses and kind of sneakin' out of the back of a space freighter with crates that they say need to move today, you'll take whatever price you get offered. But, you know, we made, we probably cleared six figures on those borinyum krystals."
: Okay.
: So this was just random that it happened to be Skip?
: You get a little image of the Junkmother putting her fingers together at the Random Factor.
: I think so.
": Why, what did that lead to? Did that lead into any unexpected events?"
": I mean, everything's unexpected, right? (laughs)"
: Can I start checking all the nuns and seeing if any of them have brain slugs?
: Oh yeah.
": Do you wanna do, you can do... Gimme an Insight check as you're probing their minds."
: Great.
: I was thinking that about Jan De La Vega. 'Cause she got the rest of the crates.
: [Lou] Oof.
: [Siobhan] 23.
: 23?
: Yeah.
: You don't suspect that any of these sisters are brain-slugged. You're not feeling that gliding-over sensation.
: Great.
": Can I ask, what's your long-term plan? Just from, you know, one schemer to another, I'm curious, you know, 'cause six figures here in Mas Vegas and drinkin' as many Bellinis as I see you all doin', I think you could go through that pretty easy."
": You see that she sort of just looks at you, and the other sisters turn over, and you see another sister says, yeah, Sadie, how much money do we have left? You see Sadie goes, I'm sure we have... Let me see. Oh no."
: [Ally] How much is it?
: We'll give you and say he didn't kill you.
: You see Sadie huddles up-
: [Siobhan] Does that work?
": With the sisters and looks around and says, looks around at everybody and says, um, so here's the issue. I checked our bank account, and we are 200.000 credits in debt."
": Oh, that's really a lot. Have you considered winning a Battle of the Brands? (Brennan laughs)"
": You see she says, how did that happen? She's like, this is a penthouse at the Andalusia, so it's expensive."
: This room's huge.
: This room is huge.
: Oh my god.
: I've been playing pool.
: And this is just for you? You each have one of these?
: I keep offering my chair and then seeing there's so many other chairs around.
: There's so many chairs in here.
: Keep's goin' back.
: That's a pinball machine.
": Hey, I'm sorry, guys, I got lost in the bathroom."
": Hey, come back, come back, come back."
": Hey, sorry."
: What bathroom did you go to?
: The one with columns or the other one?
": I went to the one with columns, but then, like, there's a mirror door that goes into a... This place is amazing."
": I know, I know."
: We should stay here.
": You see that one of the other sisters looks and says, yeah, Sadie does have the nicest room. And you see all 12 of them-"
: Oh!
: You're each in different penthouse?
": Look, okay, we made a mistake! Oh my god, have you ever made a mistake before?"
: No!
: [Siobhan] Yes. Yes.
": Like all the time, but actually that's how droids learn and get better."
: I guess that's how we learn and get better.
": [Ally] Okay, so-"
": Look, 50K. Make that a cool 200K, and we'll make a video blaming our death on whoever you want."
": I mean, you should take the 50K, 'cause we could just film... We actually have been filming you."
": We'll take the 50K, we'll take the 50K. (mutters)"
": Oh, okay, yeah, there it is."
": [Brennan] Yeah, yeah, yeah."
: This isn't California.
": Charitable, for the nuns."
": All right, we don't have to tell you."
": Yeah, the holorecorder's been running the whole time. Sorry I didn't make that clear. The little red light was on, so I thought you knew."
": Incredible. You see, she says, all right, we will absolutely record that video, and you see-"
": Yeah, we'll send you the name shortly."
": Okay. Yeah, cool, they give you a thumbs-up. They are absolutely happy to provide that to you."
: [Zac] Wow.
": If we could get the Amercadians off our... You know, if we could make it so that-"
: But we're still gonna have Weatherall.
": We need to keep this for, like, a one-two, I think, if we do something crazy to Gust-"
: Yeah.
": And then have this also name Gust as the killer, that could be great."
": Oh, that would be great."
: We just hold this.
: I agree.
: We just hold this.
: Yeah.
: [Murph] We say Gust Weatherall.
": I think if we go on the offensive right now, Gust'll be able to stomp it out."
: Yeah.
": But if we amass enough, then he won't be able to."
": Wow, well, I'm glad you're alive and that I didn't kill you."
": We're glad. We saw your face on the newscast for the first time, and we said, is that the guy that killed us? And it was like, I don't know, we were gone by that time. And it's like, okay."
": May I just really politely, you know what, can we just add like another"
: And we're gonna give it to them to give to the-
": No, no."
: Oh.
": We're gonna just, like, maybe pay the front desk."
": You see, yeah, Sadie looks and says, we are not going to tip. (group laughing)"
": Yeah, if we just see someone in the hall, we'll just give them 5.000 credits."
: Yeah.
": Okay, we can be a little bit more discerning."
: And if you would like-
": Yeah, everyone, let's-"
": To be your own boss, I am cashing out."
": Our numbers have jumped up, okay."
: [Brennan] Give me a Persuasion check.
: [Siobhan] Great.
: We gave Ronnie Kwan 2.500 for a favor.
: What's eight plus 7?
": 15\. Let me roll. Let's do a flat Luck check. That's a six. You see that she looks you. You see that as you say, do you wanna be your own boss, they say, what do you mean, be my own boss?"
": Ooh, well, let me tell you a little thing about Pleasure Putty."
": Oh my god, sisters, this is how we dig our way back outta this hole."
": This is how you dig your way out of this hole, and then I never have to do it again. (group laughing) Suddenly, the money you make on Pleasure Putty doesn't seem like very much when you have $1.2 million. (group laughing)"
": Incredible. Okay, so the sisters agreed to get you that video."
: [Zac] Great.
": Incredible, we should probably exchange numbers or something."
: Yeah. They exchange details with you. It's Sister Sadie Zeb is the covenant leader.
": (laughs) No. Anyway, yeah, we should probably-"
: That tone was just... (Ally laughs) I've heard Margaret talk business. That was not business tone.
: It was not.
: That was not a business number.
: Can I just say-
": They're non-tipping teenagers. Like, they couldn't be less attractive to Margaret."
": Oh yeah, the fact that they don't tip, they're not... Are they teenagers? How old are these people? How old are these nuns?"
": I'm into highly competent, recently-"
: Where did teenagers come from?
: Aren't they teens? How old are they?
": [Murph] No, that's the-"
": Oh no, they're full adults."
: That's the Girl Scouts.
": No, that's the Girl Guides."
": Oh, got it."
: I hope you figure out what you're looking for. Riva Mas Vegas. (laughs)
: Riva Mas Vegas?
: Riva Mas Vegas.
: Riva Mas Vegas.
": Okay, Riva Mas Vegas, yes."
: Try and get that goin'. Put that on a t-shirt.
": We'll be in touch. And Margaret, it's great meeting you. Just let us know when you want that video, and we'll get it to you, because we need the money, and we are depending on it."
": Yeah, for sure."
": [Brennan] Yeah, absolutely."
": I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding."
": Honestly, most people that you do business with, Margaret, I kind of wonder if something's going on."
": Yeah, it's winning others over, it's the-"
": I mean, there's you always gotta have a little bit of it there, you know, just a little bit so everyone's like, oh, what am I getting into?"
: Yeah.
: I wanna come back to this.
": Margaret has the, whatever the business equivalent-"
: The it factor.
: Of sapiosexual is. (group laughing)
": Just, like-"
: Yes.
: Competent-sexual.
": Wow, that was a great deal you struck."
: [Brennan] Amazing.
: Talk about it later over whiskeys?
": Yeah, yeah. (laughs)"
": Incredible, so what next? You guys have your incredible amount of money."
": And we are gonna get these shields for our ship, but we don't even have to pay for them, right? They just have a logo on them?"
: [Brennan] They just have a logo on them.
: Do they already?
: Sweet.
: Yeah.
: Should we go to Onolo Dos?
: Onolo Dos.
: Onolo Dos.
: Onolo Dos.
: Yeah.
": Can we... Oh, maybe we can do it in Onolo Dos, but now we have all this money, maybe we should talk about more upgrades. Maybe we can just talk about it-"
": Yeah, we can do it."
: We can talk about it on the way.
: We don't have to worry.
: Let's get to Onolo.
: Is there any update on what happened to the fake-
: I'm just so excited to spend some of this money.
: The Wurst-
: It's burnin' a hole-
: That was shot out?
: In my freakin' pocket.
: The fake the Wurst-
: Like a (indistinct).
": You see that that takes off, and it was set to explode, right?"
: 20 minutes later.
": By the way, you do get-"
": Oh, we've also faked our deaths."
": Yeah, you do get a message from Acne-Ashmun, where they're like, hey, just as a full FYI, the cost of a detonating spaceship is 150.000 credits."
: We didn't say spaceship.
": [Siobhan] Oh, god damnit."
: We said blimp. We said blimp.
": Well, no, they paid for it. I wasn't like, take this out of our money."
: [Siobhan] Yes.
": A conversation is broached about like, hey, about this thing that we sort of put together at the last minute for you, this is a six-figure, this is like-"
: Did you like that win? (Brennan laughs) (Brennan claps)
: Do you like wins like that?
: That win was pretty good.
": Did you like that crazy win you were, like, clapping for?"
": They say, all right, we're gonna do our best in these negotiations with Repo Reaper on your behalf, Miss Encino."
: Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Let's get a drink sometime.
": (laughs) Incredible. Cool, you guys burn a fuel unit jumping to Onolo Dos. (spaceship whooshing) (imitates whirring) It is daytime on Onolo Dos as you jump here. First of all, do you jump straight from here? 'Cause you guys are all like, all kinds of fucked up and-"
: I need to just crash.
: I need to sleep.
": No, yeah, me too."
: Yeah. I think we head to the space.
: Should we jump and- Yeah.
: Yeah.
: Crash.
: Yeah.
": Yeah, we jump and crash."
: Get away from Mas Vegas.
: Let's jump and crash.
: [Siobhan] The old just and crash.
: Awesome.
: [Ally] No more Mas Vegas.
": You jump to faster than light, and you all crash. You're gonna take a full long rest?"
: I only need three hours.
: [Brennan] Cool.
: I'm gonna move out of the engine room and into the actual living quarters.
: Oh my god.
": Oh my god, you move back. You have your little plaque being like, I don't live here. Like, please-"
: Take that off. Let's slip that under my bed.
": Oh yeah, wow."
: And lay in an actual bed for the first time in several years.
: Whoo.
": Don't applaud it, it's too-"
": No, no, that must feel incredible."
: Don't whoo. It's nice. It's nice.
: Unbelievable.
: You have to hear Barry's horrible night terrors now.
: [Lou] I love it. (Murph cries out) (group laughs)
: I can't sleep without 'em.
: Barry.
": [Zac] I'm wondering, you know, should I take a long rest, or should I just be at the helm."
: Long rest.
: Maybe I can do something-
: Yeah.
: Since I don't have to sleep that much.
": Okay, maybe we could stagger or something."
": [Emily] Yeah, we can stagger."
": Yeah, we can do shifts."
: Yeah.
: Cool.
": I mean, I happily take a, I'd go sit up there for an hour."
": Gunnie, sleep."
: Oh yeah.
: I'll offload all the footage I've shot with Handy Annie and pass her off to Margaret.
: Cut another sizzle.
": Yeah, happy to cut another sizzle from the-"
": Gunnie, I know it's in good hands if I give it to you."
": I go up to the bridge with my data pad and just hop into video-editing software and start working on a sizzle, just watching all of the highlights, like, again and again. Riva's push-pull, Skip's saving Barry, Barry, the push, the-"
": I put my hand on your shoulder and I go, if you put footage of me falling out of that nest, I will hunt you down, and I will break things-"
: I was gonna do
: On you.
: A bloopers thing.
: I was gonna do a bloopers thing.
: You need to omit me from this reel. (group laughing) Thank you so much. And then I walk back to go have a matcha.
: You were never there.
: I just get crazy and I fully take you out of all of the shots.
": I really appreciate it. Wow, that's incredible work."
": It takes a long time, but it's worth it."
": Each frame by frame, you're erasing me."
": Click, click, click, click."
: Photoshop has not evolved at all.
": No, it's still just a scrub brush. (Emily laughs)"
": Amazing. Faster than light, you see the boiling red magma planet of Lavada fading into the distance, a quick trip to Vegas with a cool mil comin' your way."
: Oh my god.
: Absolutely wild.
: And all it took was near death for all of you.
": I actually have to ask a really important question. When we were parked at Vegas, did anyone gamble in our casino?"
": Go ahead and give me... And I'm gonna say, 'cause it was Mas Vegas, we're going to move that decimal one to the right for better or for worse."
: Okay.
": All right, okay."
: Oh.
: Go big or go home.
": Big, big or go home. (Lou blows on dice)"
: And the house-
: Happens in Vegas.
: Always...
: Happens in Vegas.
: Wins!
: [Brennan] Nat 20! (all screaming) (Lou scream-laughing)
: Yes!
: It's flowing. It's flowing.
: Yes!
": This is insane! (Brennan laughing) Oh my god, I feel crazy."
: Whoo!
: The house-
: [Group] Always wins!
": The house always wins, folks."
: We are the ball. The house always wins.
: We are the ball.
: The house is rolling up.
: [Murph] We are in the zone.
: Folks!
: [Lou] We are in the absolute zone.
": Folks, if the game seems rigged, just quit and start your own game, and rig that."
: [Zac] Oh my god.
: [Brennan] Oh my fucking god.
: What does that mean?
: [Ally] How much did we just clear?
: I can't believe I just said for better or for worse. I truly thought you were gonna hit a nat one.
": [Murph] Yeah, so did I."
: [Brennan] I truly thought you were gonna hit a nat one.
: I absolutely thought that was gonna happen.
: I thought is was gonna be a beautiful storytelling if we hit a nat one and just-
: The chair.
": What's up, boy?"
: Look at this beautiful birthday gift you've given me.
: Oh my god.
: Ooh.
: Okay.
: This is actually a save.
: So the Wurst just cleared (group cheering)
": Come on now, come on now."
: Whoo.
": You heard it here first, folks, Riva Mas Vegas."
: Riva Mas Vegas.
: Riva Mas Vegas!
": Guys, I'm not gonna lie, I think we gotta upgrade our lifestyle. It's time to start living the way we deserve."
": I think so, too."
": I think we should, too."
: Who's keeping track of ship money?
: Should we go to moderate?
: I think we should we go to moderate!
: Let's go to moderate.
: Moderate.
": I'll do moderate for a month, but I just don't know-"
: Then we go back to poor.
: That I wanna live there.
": Okay, so we moved to moderate. So moving to moderate for the nargon is gonna be an extra, you pay 60 already, so an extra"
: Great.
": You wake up on a ship. You wake up on a ship. You're still trying to just- Yeah, as you get there, again, I have to point out, the suite capacity of a medium ship is supposed to be four people. So this casino is like four slot machines and an air hockey table, but-"
": Just some guy's gotten in there, goin'-"
: But we made 15 grand.
": Fuck, shit, fuck."
: We made- (laughs).
": It makes so much sense, though, 'cause we were literally docked in Mas Vegas."
: You were docked in Mas Vegas.
: [Ally] Yes.
: You guys get there. You see just waves-
: I can't believe that.
": Of cigarette smoke coming from your open freighter. You see a bunch of the Jib-Job workers are going like, (coughs), looking at the-"
": We're like, yeah, for sure, we're, we- (muttering)"
: I hold out a light.
: Can I ask what theme the slot machines have?
: [Brennan] What's that?
: What are they? Are they themed slot machines?
: [Murph] Big Bang Theory.
: You tell me.
: Big Bang Theory.
: So are they all Big Bang Theory?
": [Brennan] Oh, they're all Big Barry, yeah, it's all like-"
: Big Barry Theory?
: Yeah.
: It's all in the-
: Big Bang Barry.
: It's all like sunglasses-
: Big Bang Barry.
": Big gun, sixes."
: Barr-a-zinga.
: [Ally] No. (Siobhan groans)
: And the jackpot's a Barr-a-zinga.
": Yeah, if you get get the Barr-a-zinga, then it's called, you hear Barry's voice come over and go, ''You're in the zone.''"
: You're in the zone.
: Oh my god.
: We had a whole VO day. It was so much fun.
: We got these custom-made.
": I'm gonna say, also, on a nat 20 in Mas Vegas, I am also going to say, that role was so incredible-"
: That was insane.
": You were in Mas Vegas, it's so miraculous, you now have a permanent gambler on the ship. (group laughing)"
: [Ally] Oh no!
: You have a permanent gambler.
: [Siobhan] Oh no.
": Which means that even on days where the casino is not open, you may still move, and now the decimal moves a point in the other direction."
: Got it.
: 'Cause it's just one woman named Bambi Leroux.
": [Siobhan] Oh, Bambi."
: Bambi!
": Bambi, do you happen to be-"
: I'm gonna treat Bambi so right.
: Have a huge trust fund or-
: What's that?
": Do you have, like, a huge-"
": Oh honey, I hit a payday 40 years ago,"
": Oh, okay, okay."
: What?
": Oh my god, Bambi."
: What did you do to get 80 billion credits?
: What's that?
: What'd you do to get 80 billion credits?
": There's a slot machine inside of a hypercube, and you go in there, and if you come up three bars, you win 80 billion, and if it's anything else, you're extruded through time forever."
: Oh. (Emily gasps)
: And you took that chance? You're brave.
: [Siobhan] You're brave.
: Welcome to the ship. You bring good energy.
": Yeah. Hey, and you drink for free."
: What?
: You drink for free.
": And also, there's an egg bar."
: This guy's real cute.
": [Zac] Water, coffee."
": What are you, the manager of this casino?"
": Host, I would say."
: Shaken whiskey service?
: Yeah. (imitates popping)
: I co-manage with everyone.
": Oh, all right. Well, listen, you keep those drinks flowin', and I might give you my number later. She has like a good four or five false lashes just hanging off of her, like huge blue hair wig, beads, like this incredibly loud, floral, silk number."
": Do you know, I have someone that I think you might like."
: She's a billionaire.
": Yeah, you might-"
: You should put those eyelashes where they go.
": You might hit it off with, if you see around here somewhere, someone named Loose Duke."
: I've got a Loose Duke for him if I meet him.
: [Lou] Geez.
: Oh.
: Barry vomits.
: What does that mean?
": [Lou] Bambi, so nice to meet you."
": I show Bambi where the bathrooms are. I'm like, just so you know, they are right here, right around the corner."
": (slurred) Listen, all right, listen."
: Gnosis is still in the bathroom.
: I move Gnosis.
": I wanna say, most of the casinos, the Nero, the Andalusian, they're garbage, okay. This casino, I like. (group laughing) Okay, they're trash, okay. I like this place. I like Barry's Big Win. I don't know who Barry he is, but I like that he wins big."
": I look at Barry, and I know in my heart, he doesn't want her to know who he is, and I just decide not to say that."
": I think it's Barry Nyne's casino, which is awesome."
": Hey, this would never be Barry Nyne's casino."
: Barry Nyne's a great guy is the thing though-
: Barry's Slug's Casino.
: The Slug's Casino.
: So it could be Barry Nyne's casino.
": Barry Syx, do you have a game plan for how we could get Barry Nyne back?"
: Yeah.
": I was hoping, if it was up to me, all I could do is really just try to rip the slug out of his eye-"
: Yeah.
": Which I think would be horrifying. Is there something you could do, Skip? Like a fight inside his brain?"
: I could potentially try that.
: Hell yeah.
": Oh, I could do some stuff."
": Do you think you could, like, try and psychically find out where he is?"
: Or Barry-
: Do I know where the Unhatchening would take place? Is there a-
: Give me a Lore check with advantage.
: Is there any reason why the Unhatchening would want-
: Natural 20.
: You've gotta to be kidding me. A 17 and a natural 20.
: We are rolling- We are going to Vegas right after this.
: Rolling straight up.
: We are rolling so hot! This ball is just-
: This ball doesn't roll anymore.
: It keeps going.
": There was no chance for the casino to pay for itself before the end of the season. There was no chance. All right, on nat 20, yes, so the way-"
: I must find it within my mind.
: So the way the Great Emhatchening is supposed to- (group giggling)
": Brennan, I know that-"
: Sorry.
": We have to finish the episode, but we just keep-"
: This truly is unhinged. I'm gonna turn my seat around and try and get back on track.
": The house always wins, insane throw that mouse-trap bounces to a 20."
: To go so far...
: To land at the birthday boy's-
: Yes.
: That really is so special.
: [Lou] Is it still a 20?
: It's still a 20 right there.
: [Emily] Still a 20.
: Even in the celebrations-
: There you go.
: It didn't get still cocked.
: Still a 20?
: Frame it.
: That's that Rick Perry die. There it is.
: A separate die that you gave me-
": Oh shucks, look at that."
: For my birthday. My first set of dice.
: Aw.
": Happy birthday, happy birthday long passed. (group laughing) The birthday long ago."
: Happy birthday long passed!
": Happy birthday long passed. So on a nat 20, yes, the Great Emhatchening, good lord, of course you know about it. You've been instructed about it all the time for your entire upbringing. It's a brain slug upbringing, upbringing... You were brought up, you have a parent. You know that cerebro- slugs can reproduce without the Great Emhatchening. After all, you do have a father, King Prilbus. And you are aware of other great houses, which, of course, have to have some kind of linearity. They have to have some kind of primogeniture in order to be able to pass titles."
: How can there be generations alive at the same time?
": Exactly, so what you were always told about the Great Emhatchening was, this is a time where our species launches forward into a new evolutionary phase, right? And the Great Emhatchening is all about destroying the bodies of these hosts, which is, of course, the thing about cerebro-slugs, right, is, like, their culture is one rooted around the fact that any non-cerebro-slug in the galaxy is only fortunate to be killed and become a vessel for the hatching of new cerebro-slugs. And, you know, they are a fundamentally conquering... Like, the culture at the core of that cerebro-slug is conquering. Then you start thinking about culture. You're a cerebro-slug. You don't wanna hurt people. You're just in this guy who was, himself, kind of a mean asshole, because you wanna pilot a ship. And in all language around the Great Emhatchening, you kind of realize, cerebro-slugs have to exist, like other species, in the billions or trillions or quadrillions, in the vastness of the galaxy. How the hell... What, you're the sole unique cerebro-slug there's ever been? There's gotta be a ton of cerebro-slugs that are fuckin' off and doin' whatever the hell they wanna do. But they're probably not all princes. The Great Emhatchening is an aspect not of cerebro-slug biology, because biology isn't that immutable. Biology is weird and vast, and there's nuances and complexities endlessly, probably there's tons of cerebro-slugs out there doing other cool, interesting shit. However, you don't organize on biology, but you can organize with culture, and especially the highly feudalistic, regimented culture of the House of Frangus and the monarchy, the Mentaphagian Dynasty. So the Great Emhatchening is this thing that you know, they bring all these bodies together. There's a huge orgy, everyone fucks, and the bodies all turn into soup. And the way it's an evolutionary step forward is that the cerebro- slugs melt down and use the DNA of their host bodies to jump forward in an evolutionary step, taking features, traits, knowledge, et cetera, from all the host bodies that they're bringing together. Now, there could be an untold number of Mentaphagian loyalist cerebro-slugs out there. You also know that in the lore of the Great Emhatchening, there's this idea of, we need the completed DNA strands of the noble houses, which when you are hearing, like, we can't do it without you, you kind of have a feeling of, like, on a nat 20, you're like, you could, you just don't want to. There are these completed lines, these noble houses. It's an act of station. It's an act of hierarchy to not do it without you, right? Within that, as well, in the Great Emhatchening, you know that there is lore about The Great Egg. About a thing that they would use to summon that next evolutionary step for whatever cerebro-slugs would become after the Great Emhatchening. The Great Egg is something that in the ancient lore... 'Cause, like, it's been countless... Like, the last Great Unhatchening is mythic. It only occurs in lore of ancient heroes of the cerebro-slug noble houses. It maybe has never even occurred at all, right? But in the lore, there's a talk about a Great Egg. And that great egg is often something that the cerebro-slugs... It's not an egg that is created or laid. Like, you know, the process biologically by which cerebro-slugs latch onto the brain stem, kill the host, lay the eggs, and the slugs eat the brain, and then crawl out looking for new hosts. That process of breeding, you know, usually creates, like, between somewhere, say a dozen or half dozen new cerebro-slugs whenever that happens, but the Great Emhatchening would do something else. Again, that evolutionary leap forward. The Great Egg in lore is not an egg that is laid during this process, but it looks like the egg is necessary for the Emhatchening to commence, and that it is almost something that is summoned or built or created as part of this grand ritual for the cerebro-slugs."
": Okay. So wherever that Great Egg is, is likely where the Emhatchening will take place, if it's like a thing that is stationary. But on a nat 20, do I have any guess as to what the slug that Barry Nyne may or may not have was doing in relation to all this?"
": Yeah, what does Barry Nyne's slug have to do with the Princeps?"
": There was a report. I mean, I don't know. People remember, there was that report about millions of people showing up on Rubian V to hold hands and do stuff."
": Oh, the pilgrims."
: And maybe the Great Egg is-
": I was just gonna say, they're clearing out Rubian V. What if in the core will be this egg."
: The egg.
: Can I make an Investigation check on the Princeps?
": Yeah, go for it."
: [Zac] Just like-
: I think we did.
: I think we've checked for-
: We've checked? Okay.
: You can't check too much for something.
: [Siobhan] There's no harm in checking.
: Even if they're-
: [Lou] You can't check too much for slugs.
": Not brain-slugged, but are they the Great Egg or something? Investigation, sorry. 13."
": Zortch looks at all of you and says, well, what is everyone looking me for?"
: Is there sort of like a large egg on your home world?
: A large egg on my home world?
: The Great Egg.
: No.
: What if the moon is the Egg? What if Gnosis is the Egg?
": Was there ever, like, a sudden attitude change in any of your parents while you were alive? I guess that's kind of a weird question, but-"
": [Emily] Like, one morning, did they seem-"
": Was a moment where they kind of couldn't really move their bodies for a little bit, and then kind of got better at it?"
": No, no, no, nothing like that. I mean, if you're looking... You think I was brain-slugged?"
": Mm, maybe not."
: Maybe your parent was.
": Has anyone given me an Insight? You guys just gave me Insight on Zortch, right?"
: I did an Investigation on Zortch.
: I'll do an insight on Zortch. That's a 26.
": 26? Riva, you start looking at Zortch. You remember, the reason you first found Zortch was their deep connection to their home world in a way that was very unusual for... Like, they psychically connected to a computer-"
: Right.
": A computer that makes up the totality that is like the body of their home world. You also know that the rest of their royal family is made up of people that seem to be a lot more shrewd. Like, you don't know... Like, I don't know if you guys have questioned Zortch about their psychic abilities, but Riva, you know, for example, like, you're a very powerful psychic even for Aguatunisians, but Aguatunisians all have a latent psychic ability. Rubians don't, necessarily. It is meaningful that Zortch is psychic, and it's actually something that's quite special about them, in the way that it would be for, most humans are not psychic, but you know, many are or some are, right? So Zortch, you sense, Riva, that Zortch has this connection to the planet that is psychic in nature."
: Barry Nyne wasn't trying to get Gnosis.
: [Murph] I know.
: [Emily] Yeah.
": Wait, so they were trying to take over the Princeps so that they could have that evolutionary leap forward, thus controlling Gnosis."
": Yeah, I think it might just be a random collision of interests."
": Yeah, because yeah. Barry Nyne had an opportunity to grab Gnosis but was more interested in the Princeps."
": Yeah, he was completely uninterested."
": So maybe, if they wanted to slug the Princeps, then they could control a whole moon, essentially."
": Slug the Princeps, slug the world."
: [Ally] Oh no.
: Okay.
: Oh no.
: What?
": Did you like Heroes, Princeps?"
: Hmm?
: [Zac] The Book of Heroes?
: I love heroes. You guys are great.
": Yes, that's what we meant."
": Yeah, can I ask them about their psychic abilities or what that was like?"
": [Emily] Yeah, when did those start?"
": They started early, early in my life, like infancy. And yeah, I've just always sort of had these latent psychic powers. And, you know, I sort of felt a connection to nature to my home world. And I could just, I mean, worlds all do kind of have a soul to them, right? I mean, there's energy in all these things. There's energy in the minds and hearts of living beings, in the organic matter of the living world, and even in the gravity and density, the friction, the heat, the warmth, all of it, the movement of particles, even in what the average person would think of as inert matter, it all has a force or an energy to it. And I have always been able to sense that and-"
: Has anyone ever asked you to use that?
": No. In terms of reactions, my..."
": Sorry, do you have to keep-"
": Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely."
": And I'm sorry, there's a really long line."
": You see they look and they say, the first time, well, it was sort of latent, and then you see Raymond Zam comes up. By the way, what I will say, all this is occurring as you're going faster than light. This is after you've rested, I assume."
: Yeah.
: Yeah.
": So, like, first of all, I just wanna... Just to narrate so we know where we are in time, you get back to the ship, still fucked up, with 15.000 credits waiting for you in the casino, huge win, Mas Vegas, go. You wake up in faster than light. You've probably got like, you know, 30 martrons before you're coming out of faster than light in Onolo Dos. But I think there's a moment where you wake up on the ship, long-rested, you're all fully healed. You sleep back in the crew quarters with everybody else. You see like... You see... You know, you walk downstairs that morning, go to the kitchen, Zortch has got breakfast. You see Aurora Nebbins is crunching on a bighorn tortoise happily and nuzzles Sid, looks so... Aurora Nebbins knows that she did good. She knows she did good. You see Raymond come over to you, Gunnie, with a cup of coffee. Here you go, man."
": Hey, thank you, man."
": Yeah, there you go."
: Cheers.
": Clink. And he says 13 happy Jib-Jobbers, he says-"
": And many more to come, hopefully."
": He says, look at his email address I just got. He shows you a little email from Crunch Moon-Jones, talking about an approved gold star status."
: Yes. Okay.
": Yes. Oh, actually, I will do a quick check for Loose Duke."
: Give me a quick check-
": [Lou] I mean, while the ball is up."
: For Loose Duke.
: I'll give her the Help action.
": [Lou] One more, one more."
": Nope, I didn't get it."
": (laughs) Murph, are you okay?"
: Happy birthday.
": [Siobhan] Happy birthday, Murph. Happy Murph day."
": Yeah, like, walking up, again, the beautiful bridge of your ship, the new thrusters, this money in the bank, all your new awesome gear. You look down, the Jib-Jobbers, Princeps Zortch in the kitchen, and you've got a casino with Bambi Leroux."
": Bambi. Cha-ching, lookin' good. Hey, gimme a little smile, lemme see if I hit these three bars. (Lou laughs)"
": I walk up, I'm like, Gunnie, you don't have to do that. I take- I drag you."
": [Brennan] I like you, I like you."
: Gunnie you're setting up-
: I present-
: A precedent-
: A full meal-
: That you do not want.
: To Bambi.
": A full meal? She goes, what do you have? What kind of food is this? What is in this?"
: French toast and pancakes and-
: French toast and pancakes?
: French toast and-
: [Murph] So many carbs.
": She's like, oh, very cultured."
: [Zac] That's a lot of syrup.
": A French toast sandwich, yes, thank you."
: (laughs) Anything to get you to eat it.
": Oh, that's rich, worth the calories. (laughs)"
": Bambi, just in case, I don't think this is gonna go anywhere, but do you have any latent psychic abilities?"
": Who, me?"
": Yes, you."
": Sure. I dream four times at once, ever since I was in the hypercube."
: Four times at once?
: [Emily] So you have like-
: I don't have time to explain it. Ask my therapist.
": (laughs) Okay, sorry."
: You are in therapy.
: Can I get you something?
: So you are in therapy?
": Well, they're back on Mas Vegas, so I don't know when I'll see 'em again. I'm gonna get back to gambling."
": [Lou] Yeah, of course."
: You think any of these little screenwriters know how to play Holdem?
: Ask them.
": Okay. Wake up, you nerds! You see she scoots up."
": We're gonna have to put up, like, one of those doggy fences. (Brennan laughs) You only stay in the casino. Sorry, Bambi."
: Let them get used to each other's scent.
": Yeah, yeah, under the door."
": Incredible, so yes, this is where you're having your conversation with Zortch, in your beautiful, wild proldier ship, with Margaret's office up top. Oh, and hanging up in the wall, that you actually get, there's little holo- things recorded everywhere, not only did Acme-Ashmun already put their logo up on the side, but you also, under the window in a little gleaming, golden badge is a U4F logo, so everyone knows if they fuck with you, they're fucking with the union."
: [Siobhan] Nice.
": Incredible, look at your ship! So yes, cutting back to this moment, Zortch looks and goes, the last... The time... I had latent psychic powers, but it wasn't until I was really... I was like nine or 10. No, no, yeah, I would've been like 15 or 16 cycles old when my grandparents got approached about the revolution. It was right before all that happened is when we understood how deeply my psychic powers connected me to the planet. That, yeah, that was like a few nargons before United Free Trade Planets approached my grandparents."
: So what do you think that means?
": It seems unrelated. I don't know. I mean, my parents and grandparents were really proud. It was cool that I was psychic, but you know, I always felt a little bit like a black sheep in that family. I mean, they're all, like, really ruthless politicians."
: What were your grandparents like?
": They wanted the royal house dead, and the UFTP approached them and said, hey, if you make these deals about mining contracts with us, we'll..."
: Weird.
": Well, I think we can say for sure that Barry Nyne is headed there."
: Yeah.
: Yeah. It seems like all roads lead there.
": Roads lead back to Rubian V, where it all began."
: It all begins.
: Rubian V is a moon that looks like a ball.
: A ball rolls.
: And it's rolling.
: It's around the planet.
: God damn.
: Not necessarily a direction of up.
: [Lou] God damn.
": Zortch looks up at you moments before you come out of faster than light and just says, is there anything I should be nervous about or worried about? Like, what are you guys thinking or seeing that I'm not thinking or seeing?"
: Just kind of like a billion brain slugs.
": Yeah, so-"
": Just, like, a bunch."
: We think-
: A brain slug orgy.
: In the middle of the planet.
": You're gonna need to mask up, for sure."
: Have you ever come into contact with the House of Frangus? (Brennan stifles laugh)
": [Zac] The house, from the-"
: It's the first time one of you guys has said it.
": [Ally] Yeah, I know."
": You see they look at you and they say, House of Frangus, well, that's not a Rubian house that I know of."
": Oh, okay, great, so-"
: But no one's ever come up to you-
: Seneschal Vrong? Do you know Seneschal Vrong?
: Cinnamon Shell Vrong?
": No, I don't know that."
": King Prilbus? My father, King Prilbus."
: King Prilbus. Prilbus Vrong.
: These are real names. (group laughing)
: Chamberlain Drablian.
: We all did-
: Chamberlain Drablian.
: [Emily] We all did a lot of drugs yesterday
: We're not makin' fun.
": Yeah, we're not making fun."
": Yeah, we're all coming down hard."
: These are very serious-
: This is serious. Lives are on the line.
": [Ally] I think, yeah, maybe we explain-"
: Viceroy Prab?
: Prab?
: Prab.
: Prab.
: Prab.
: Prab.
": Okay, so I'll keep an eye out for King Prilbus, the Viceroy Prab, Chamberlain Drablian-"
: Drablian.
: Drablian.
: Drablian.
: And Seneschal Vrong of the House of Frangus.
: Seneschal Vrong.
: And also-
: Just watch out for Stacks.
": Oh yeah, oh, you also see the Galactic Girl Guides over in the corner, who are now dealing cards for some of the... Stacks looks at up at the Jib-Job workers and says, all right, it's 15K at the front door."
: [Lou] Wow. (Brennan imitates shuffling)
": I go around to them, and they all have to sign up for a one-on-one with me. They have their slots."
: [Brennan] The Galactic Girl Guides-
: I go to the bathroom and then just look in the mirror at Skipper's face-
: Mm-hmm.
": And just kind of talk to him for a second and say, hey, man, I think I figured you out. And, uh, I'm sorry that your life was what it was. And I'm sorry that I'm in control of your body, but I think I can do a lot better with it than you were doing."
: Give me an Insight check with advantage. (gentle poignant music)
: 21.
": Norman Takamori did not choose to become a patsy of the Brigade. All of the various people that served underneath Norman Takamori did not choose to be constantly harassed, belittled, and abused by him, both when he was in the Brigade, happily carrying out terrible orders with zeal and glee, and Skip, for that's the name that Skip has chosen. That's the name Skip wants to be referred to. Other people can say prince this or prince that. That's fine. You didn't choose to be a cerebro-slug. You didn't choose to have the body that you had. And it's a galaxy filled with wild, wild things. In this moment in the mirror, you feel something, somewhere, in some way, respect the honor of addressing this moment and the fact that maybe for the first time that you're aware of, a cerebro-slug from a noble house bent on total galactic domination has actually spoken to one of the many fall-away effects of living in a dangerous and hostile galaxy, where choices get made fast and loose all the time. You feel a sense of rest, a sense of acceptance. Maybe it's you, maybe somewhere it's a sleeping Norman, or maybe the distinction has to prove how and why it matters in a galaxy filled with all this chaos. But you do know that you can make a difference for your friends in this galaxy. You feel a sense of control come over this craft you are piloting as it accepts that the galaxy is better for whatever this symbiosis is."
: I'm gonna kiss the mirror. (group laughing)
: And then you break it.
: Make sure to slap it too.
: Yeah. (laughs) (glass shattering)
": Incredible. You move from the room. The ship comes out of faster than light. Beautiful crystalline, purple-blue quartz mountains, with incredible polygon, you know, quarter-mile-long flat planes of crystal mountains that are capped by weird little moss forests, fungal mushroom trees pop out of them, and a really bright sort of chilly, bustling city, it's like a small city. It sort of feels like a blue, crystalline, a very alpine attitude here. You guys got cleared for a ship-shape nursery, 'cause Acme-Ashmun is footing the work bill. So a bunch of-"
: Brand name.
: Ooh.
": Wow, look at us."
: I'm wearing a feather boa. That's what my moderate lifestyle paid for.
": I love it. Oh, that's right. Anyone that wants to spend on the moderate lifestyle as well, it's-"
": Oh, I think Gunnie's wearing a hat, like a fedora."
": Yeah, you're filled with a sense of happiness as you-"
: Skip has a metal thermos.
": [Brennan] A metal thermos, incredible."
": Barry's wearing a shirt instead of, like, combat armor, and he keeps just tugging at it."
": So all of you exit onto the surface of Onolo Dos. As you do, you see the workers come out and they say, (sighs) welcome, Gunner Channel, to Onolo Dos."
: Don't do that.
: What's that?
: Don't do that.
: [Brennan] Don't do what?
: I think we asked for discretion.
": Yeah, we asked for discretion."
: You guys don't know what discretion is?
: So don't-
: You don't have to do the little whisper.
: Strike one. (group laughing)
": Oh my god, do the boss thing where you put a stack of your tip and then take it away, every time they-"
: Oh no.
": Bad uncle, bad uncle."
": Anyway, sorry, I didn't wanna bust your balls, but-"
: I shake their hand.
: Would you have reached out... What was your reaching out to Auma?
: I would imagine that we would ask her to meet us at the ship.
: Yeah.
: Yeah.
: At the shipyard.
": Okay, amazing. I am going to say this. You guys actually do not go to the planet surface in that case."
: [Siobhan] Okay.
: [Lou] So I wasn't a dick to that guy?
: [Brennan] You were not a dick to that guy yet.
: Beautiful. (laughs)
: I do still still have a feather boa.
: Gunnie's got a fedora on and is now mean.
: [Ally] Oh my god. Oh my god.
: They don't fuckin' see it yet.
: 4'11'' in a fedora. (group chattering)
: Don't say that to me.
": I'm in, like, a vest, a suit vest with no, but a t-shirt underneath it."
": Oh, gross."
": Very like, at a bar mitzvah."
: Yes. (laughs)
": Auma says she's going to meet you up... Auma says, I'll meet you up at... There's a station that's fully Acme-Ashmun-equipped for medium-tier ships and larger."
: So this is like-
: Great.
": Where they put the stuff on, like the gargantuan, like the star destroyers and stuff. So she says, I'm gonna... Oh, she says, I'm gonna get a ferry up there so that we can just hightail it right out of there. You end up docking at a place called Myrmidon Station, which is in orbit over this blue, mountainous Onolo Dos planet, blue-purple mountainous. You see the Acme-Ashmun guys, as you step off the ship, are there and they're like, here you go. And they pat these, like, pyramidal, enormous shield generators. These shield generators, I will tell you right now, halve all energy damage, give you resistance to energy damage while shields are up, resistance to kinetic damage while shields are up-"
: [Ally] Wow.
": And allow crew members to use reactions to return fire (Emily gasps) on enemy ship fire. Acme-Ashmuns are the real deal, renowned the galaxy wide."
": Gunnie, I see why you like this product."
: It's not bad.
: [Ally] Wow.
": And they accept a... They're like, we'll accept a payment. They say, do you have any other mods you wanna get while you're here?"
: [Lou] Oh yeah.
": Oh, for sure."
: Definitely.
": We can do that afterwards, but you guys hand a list of mods to the ship."
: Incredible.
": They say, Acme-Ashmun's footin' the labor bill, so we'll get to work, gang."
: Thank you so much.
: Appreciate you.
"B: You guys head off the ship, going through … It's very, like, little irises and metal ports, and you're sort of going through more … It's more like, a little bit similar to Madrugada Station. It's like ports and irises and smaller places. You head out to go meet up with Auma Liu, and a pair of double doors opens up with 60 UFTP shock troopers, Barry Nyne, and Lucienne Rex right in front of you. Hi, Margaret. That's all for this episode of Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey. Tune in next week, and we'll see ya in the stars."
: What? Wait.
: [Zac] Attack-
: Oh.
: [Ally] My friend!
: I cast Buffer.
: Remember that nat one on the Forgery check to contact-
": [Zac] Yeah, I was-"
: Auma Liu?
: Just thinking about that.
: [All] Oh.
: Damnit.
: Oh no.
": [Lou] Well, what, hey."

: What's going on?
": Well, I was hoping you could tell me that. Do you know why I'm here?"
: No.
: She narrows her eyes and looks at you and says-
": Oh, oh, are you trying to get people to sign up and come to your girlfriend's art show?"
(Lou chuckles)
: My fiance-
: Mm.
: Doesn't really do art.
: I agree.

"B: Hello, one and all! Welcome back to another thrilling episode of ""Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey"". I am your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always, our Intrepid Heroes. Say hi, Intrepid Heroes."
": Hi, Intrepid Heroes!"
": Oh, you little creeps. You're all doomed."
: That's what you think.
": Last we left off, our Intrepid Heroes were on Myrmidon Station in orbit over Onolo Dos, having come here to rendezvous with Auma Liu, the original designer of Sundry Sidney. We had just come from Mas Vegas, Lavada, having won the Battle of the Brands at the Kubla-Cola Gladiatorial Arena. How about it?"
: Unreal.
: An advance of 200.000 spending cash.
": And we're gonna get that million any day, right?"
": Honestly, a life highlight."
"S: Yes, yes, truly."
": Yeah, Brennan, what are the odds that you actually thought we were gonna pull that off?"
": I really, for people that know off-camera, I really kept mentioning how good it would be even if you lost. I was like, 10.000 each is not bad as a signing bonus. Like, let's keep in perspective that this is good whether we win or lose."
": Never, no way."
: And we all said no.
: You going ''This is the hardest battle I've ever done'' made us so focused. I've never seen this group so single-minded.
": Yes, you really reined in this group of idiots."
": I think you just happened to hit, like, everyone here who has ADHD, is hyper focused. (everyone laughs) You really did, we all just were like..."
": Brennan, what happened after that?"
": Well, I'll tell you. It truly is so... I feel like, in the scene, we were all like, this is the wacky, crazy season. And I realized that by having the galaxy be wacky and crazy, all it's done is shift, and all you guys are like, get your fucking head in the game. It is us against the galaxy, all right? There's no fucking around this season."
: It's true. So true.
": It's honestly perfect. Last we left off, this incredible battle. You guys are getting brand new Acme-Ashmun shields on The Wurst. You've come to a Acme- Ashmun ship nursery, where you've got a bunch of ship mechanics working to install a ton of new mods and equipment. Since the last shoot, we know that we're getting Mark Four thrusters, Mark Two plating, Atomo-Torch Particle Blasters with the Kaleida-Connect Acme-Ashmun telescoping targeting systems."
: Oh my God.
": A whole bunch of flare pods coming in. We got a whole bunch of dope stuff happening. Not only that, but as we remember, it's been a long adventure here in the galaxy. What started as a mistreated rag tag group of bottom of the barrel proldiers has quickly become a force in the galaxy under the business acumen of Margaret 'Maggie' Encino and the new piloting skills of Skip. Our crew of gunners, Sundry Sidney and Big Barry Syx, our ship's mechanic, Gunthrie 'Gunnie' Miggles-Rashbax, and comms officer, Riva, have all come together to take, first, a Smash 'n Grab job on Rec getting Aurora Nebbins, followed by another Smash 'n Grab that you actually kind of turncoated on to kill Sheriff Warner Codge in the town of Baustin, New Texas. Getting a briefcase of Kublacaine and selling it to Crunch Moon-Jones. You've got a ship with Barry's Big Win Casino and your permanent gambler, Bambi LaRoux, there with your Bar Buddy droid."
": Oh my God, that nat 20. Unbelievable."
: Unbelievable.
: That's my highlight.
: Yeah.
": Yeah, that was insane."
": You also have the highest it's ever been, a Jib-Job space with 13 Jib- Jobbers, overseen by your bud, Raymond Zam, the facility managers here from Jib-Job. And a stocked kitchen with the Princeps Zortch as your in-house kitchen staff."
: A prince chef.
"B: A princechef, thank you, princechef. Princhef."
: Princechef.
": Princhef Zortch cooking incredible meals round the clock, as well as a crew, having joined U4F, a union ship, now able to take union contracts with a little bit of charity work on the Skip's part as, you know, managing facilities for the Galactic Girl Guides troop that you now find yourselves also here with on the ship. And also, the wonderful Royal Blue Mastiff, Aurora Nebbins, helping you with your big horn tortoise problem. And also, maybe someone else on the ship. Loose Duke..."
": I swear, he's loose in the walls."
: He's in the walls!
": It's all right, guys, it's gonna be an end of season twist that it was Plug all along. And we're all gonna kiss and it's gonna be great."
": Plug is loose, too."
: We're all gonna kiss.
: I would absolutely kiss Plug.
": Plug is love, dude."
: Plug is love.
: Plug is love.
: One Plug.
": One Plug, one love. ♪ One Plug, one Plug ♪"
": That's right, we've made friends all over this galaxy, but we also in the Griivarr worlds were cornered by the Guernican Art Squad, who amongst all the factions coming after us, the Amercadian Space Brigade, United Free Trade Planets, Repo Reapers, Living Doll Cybernetics and their Warfare Whitneys, and now the Guernican Art Squad, as well as the dreaded House of Frangus."
: Fuck.
: The cerebro-slug.
: Frangus.
": Monarchy, God, there's a lot going on this season. (Ally laughs) But all of this revolving around the discovery of Gnosis, the super powerful planetary super computer embedded in a holofract, passenger on your ship that you awakened into android consciousness. Gnosis working on a plan to undo the coming violence in Rubian V, to save the people of Rubian V, to somehow disperse itself throughout the galaxy, because as Gnosis said, as long as Gnosis exists, all of you will be in danger. And you also arriving at Myrmidon Station to meet up with Auma Liu, you were instead ambushed and surprised by Lucienne Rex, Barry Nyne."
A: I forgot.
": Murderer of the Barry Batallion, and a squadron of UFTP shock troops, which is where we return. Auma Liu, the last piece of your puzzle that you wanted to come and retrieve, while Gnosis was concocting the plan to return to Rubian V and fix the coming crisis there. As we know, billions of pilgrims coming to the planet. The Monarch of Rubian V, the parent of Princeps, Princhef Zortch, they're rattling sabers and preparing for war to break contract with UFTP. Chaos coming on the horizon! Very little time left. All of you stare at Barry Nyne and Lucienne Rex. (doors whooshing) Two doors open in the hall of Myrmidon Station behind you, and stepping into the path behind you are two towering Vercadian Protector droids. (upbeat music)"
: So it's Lucienne.
: Barry.
: Barry.
": And 60 troopers? Oh, okay, for sure."
: 60 troopers. And behind you are two Vercadian Protector droids.
: That are there to protect us?
": I hit shut on the door and just, I fricking skedaddle."
": They're behind us, though."
": They're behind us, too."
: The Vercadian-
: How'd they get behind us? God damn it.
": You're walking down a hallway. You see Lucienne looks and says, Maggie, it's really good to see you."
: Yeah. You look great.
: Thank you. You look great as well.
: Thank you.
": Okay, good. Better say it back."
": You see that she looks at you all and says, should go without saying that all of you are under arrest. I want you to know everything's gonna be taken care of. In probably a couple of malton units, you're gonna be let go. You're not being charged with a crime, there's nothing happening, you're just being detained."
": So if we're... I thought you said we're under arrest, but we're not being charged with anything."
B: Yeah.
: What is the reason for the detention? 'Cause perhaps it's a misunderstanding.
": Okay, so I see what's happening here. There's sort of a conversation about legality happening here. You're on United Free Trade Planets property. Myrmidon Station is a UFTP outpost. So, everyone is always committing a crime here because they are trespassing, so we actually retain the right to selectively arrest anyone we want at any time."
: So it's the trespassing.
"B: Yes, you're trespassing."
": Oh, I see, I see."
": Obviously we have, you know, thousands of visitors come to Myrmidon Station every day, so it's a selectively enforced trespassing, and we are selecting to enforce it now. However, we'll talk. Your ship, we've already interfaced with Acme-Ashmun, the modifications are continuing on your ship. You'll have your ship and be able to leave in a few malton units."
: I've been arrested a lot of times. This is the nicest one.
: Really? Okay.
: This is probably the sweetest one I've ever experienced.
": I think I turn to Margaret, because like, I mean, this is your friend, right? Is there any chance that she could be helping us out?"
: What about Gnosis?
: They seem to not be interested in the ship.
: Can I do an insight check on Lucienne?
": Yeah, go for it. Yeah, go for it."
": Oh, that's a nat 20, baby."
": Number one, you're looking at a hologram."
: Ooh.
: Oh!
": And Barry Nyne as well, on a nat 20. The troopers and Vercadian droids are all incredibly real. But these two, knowing how kind of unpredictable you guys can be, proldiers can be, were happy to hologram in for this interaction."
: Okay.
": Margie, are you okay?"
": Barry's just fully trying see the slug, even though it's not possible."
: I have a hologram. I have Hologram and I know that it's a range of 60 feet. Can I try and scan and see who's casting this hologram?
": Yeah, give me a technology check."
E: Okay.
A: Can I give you the help action?
"B: Yeah, yeah, go for it."
": Okay, better, better. 21."
": It's being projected short range from another room, but you are in... Myrmidon Station is a kind of classic, drab corporate space station, right?"
": Okay, so it's probably not them who are projecting their own hologram."
": It's probably a technology where they're somewhere else in the station using the station's natural, or not natural, but using the station's technology."
: Can we hack that to make it say something different?
: Right now?
": I'm saying this psychically to people, so this is not..."
": As you begin to say that, also say on that, what were you looking for emotionally on that nat 20 insight?"
": Honestly, just how she felt about Margaret, mostly."
": Oh, nat 20 insight?"
: Yeah.
": There's a deep, complex stew of emotions and feelings going on here, that even registering through projected images, you're able to read that there's a lot going on."
: It's like classic long term friendship.
": Great, no, it's definitely..."
": Okay, like, what do you guys think? Should we just go?"
: I mean...
": We can't let 'em get Gnosis, right?"
": Yeah, I think maybe ask for time so that we can, like, lock up the ship. Say that I have, like, personal diaries that I don't want to fall into the wrong hands."
": We all have diaries, yes."
: My diary's extremely personal.
": We're happy to go with you, but we all, we each... There are a number of important personal items that we need to go and take care of. But then where should we meet you after that?"
": Oh, believe me, we're happy to take care of that. And in fact, we already are."
": Oh, okay."
": I'm gonna need you, Siobhan, to make a constitution saving throw."
": (gasps) No! That's bad! (upbeat music) That's a, God. That's a solid two."
: Can I turn around to the Vercadian Protector droid behind us?
": Yeah, it's a three."
": Copy that. You turn around to the Vercadian behind you, absolutely."
": I wanna say, you need to take out all of them for us. And I just got Force of Personality, so they roll a wisdom saving throw."
: These guys are maxed out on everything.
": May I, like, help this by, do you remember when I saw that Vercadian Protector droid and he gave me, like, this little mantra? I wanna mind link with the Vercadian Protector droid and repeat that, like, mantra to them."
": As you do that, we're gonna resolve this first. 'Cause what you guys see is alarming."
": Oh, man."
": You just see Riva's psychodrone deactivate. (power humming) Power down. Riva, you have a moment of opening your eyes in your body, in a glass bulb of water. You can see that some drug has been added to the water that's, like, made you drowsy and knocked you out. And they are carting you away from The Wurst. There's already UFTP people surrounding the ship-"
: What?
": Oh, dear."
": That have, like, drawn you out of the ship and are carting you away, and you go unconscious."
": Okay, I cast Buffer on myself."
: We've gotta just surrender.
": I think we faint, I think we faint."
: Let's all faint?
": No, like, you know, like-"
": You turn around, so you turn around and say that to the Vercadian droid. And Emily, what action are you taking? You're Buffering right now?"
: I'm casting Buffer just in case things get nasty.
: You see that Vercadian burns through that legendary resistance that you know these guys have. (Emily whistles)
: Can I look and make a perception check just real fast? Looking for vents.
": Yeah, go for it."
: Oh.
": No, that was good."
: We know that there's a system of air shafts.
: That would be an 11.
": As 11, you look around, this hallway is perfectly sleek. I mean, there's an air vent, you know, a bunch, it'll be like 100 feet on the other side of those Vercadians."
": I think Barry's put his hands up to be like, all right, if we're being polite, maybe let's not take people out on our ship. Show us that Riva's okay, reunite us, and we won't kill half of your troops. (energy pulsing)"
": Lucienne, in her own hologram, shows you a hologram of Riva being sort of suspended in this bulb of water."
: Whoa!
: That's not how we wanna see Riva.
": I understand. Riva's a very powerful psychic, so that was a priority for us."
": Great. Okay, well, I'm gonna walk around and touch Sid, Handy Annie, and Skip, and be like, guys, I think we should just go. And I'm gonna cast invisibility to cameras on them and then start to walk forward."
: Incredible.
: So you guys are undetectable to electronic sensors and cameras.
: Okay.
: Amazing.
: But you can still be seen in regular people's vision.
": So the Vercadians and the troops look at you guys. Lucienne looks around and says, where are they, where are they? And you see that Barry, Barry Nyne says, cyborg."
: Then can I cast Hologram to replace Handy Annie-
: Yes.
: That I made.
": Cool. You cast that, replace that, and you see Barry Nyne goes, thing's a piece of shit! Then slams on something in front of wherever he's really standing."
": Maybe you just don't know how to operate what you're working with, and I mean that in a way beyond just the obvious thing that we're talking about, Barry Slug."
": Barry Nyne's eyes go wide. He sees this. I'm surprised at you, Barry Syx, calling your brother a slug."
": I'm not calling my brother a slug, I'm calling you a slug, Barry Slug."
": The only slug here is you, buddy."
: I don't have a problem with slugs. One of my best friends is a slug. Skip is a slug and I think Skip is awesome.
": Shut up, shut the fuck up."
: You shut the fuck up.
: Shut the fuck up.
: You shut the fuck up.
: Shut the fuck up.
: You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
: You can't use Barry Nyne's comeback!
: Anyone else who wants to give me an insight check?
: Nat one.
": Oh, but mine was good."
": Okay, wait, actually, I got a four."
: 25.
: 16.
": 25\. On a 15, you're not looking at your brother."
: Yeah.
": When this thing of Barry Nyne being like, shut the fuck up about slugs, shut the fuck up about slugs, starts happening, you catch the barest, almost imperceptible eye roll from Lucienne."
E: Ooh.
: I'm gonna start walking forward.
: Cool.
": Yeah, I make the hologram of Skip, Handy Annie, and Sid walk forward."
": So the holograms begin to walk forward, you guys are surrounded by troops, and you are all moved through these places. Move on to another segment, more troops. And eventually, you are brought to a prison area within Myrmidon Station. As you come in, one by one, they begin to disarm you. Take your equipment, take all your stuff. Your data pad goes. Obviously, they leave your cybernetic stuff. Your data pad goes, your gadgeteer's harness goes."
": And what about the stuff that's on Riva, since-"
": Oh, the stuff that's on Riva from the Psychodrone? That they collect and take."
L: So the Psychodrone's not with us.
: Psychodrone goes with your equipment.
: I happily give them my guns and my crystal dagger.
: Cool.
: And that's it.
": No, you're just a hologram. You get to keep anything on you you want."
: We're people.
: The real people can save.
: There's real people there and there's cameras.
": Oh, got it, got it, yeah."
": So there's a cool thing happening here. However, the people on the ground doing it can see."
": Got it, got it, I thought they were all Vercadians."
": No, so equipment's being taken."
L: And the Vercadians can see us.
": The Vercadians can see you guys as well. Do you open that channel to the Vercadians, by the way, to say it?"
": Yeah, I wanted to do it, and I don't recall precisely what the words were because you said them so beautifully and I was rapt and didn't write them down."
: No worries.
: But I repeat what I learned.
": The mantra comes back to you from those Vercadian Protector androids, and you hear one of them saying in your mind, my apologies, sister. We're here to collect a contract. These matters will be resolved between those of organic flesh. We will let no harm come to you, but we will not interfere in this matter."
: I appreciate that. What is the contract?
": We serve in the protection of those interests which our crafters, our siblings in the Andromedicones, have sent us here to this place. Vercadians serve, we protect, and we wait. The time has not yet come for us to act."
: What are you waiting for?
: Their eyes glow red a little bit.
": 'Cause if you're up to something, I might get in on it."
": You see one sort of cracks a smile. He goes, keeper of souls, there is more pressing matters for you at hand."
": Okay, well, I appreciate a little bit of camaraderie before I go into imprisonment, so thank you very much."
": While we're walking, can I just be kind of talking to everybody, saying like, okay, I don't know what this is gonna be, but as long as we, like, keep the... I don't know, I'm just giving sage advice."
: Cool.
": I'm really scrambled, so it's not really making sense, but I'm just kind of, like, nodding."
: Prisons can be good.
": This is kind of crazy, but I don't know, they're holograms, I can just... Do we think Lucienne's a slug as well? Why is she rolling her eyes? Or she's just annoyed."
": You know, she is a slug or is tolerating it."
: Like of hearing about this thing?
: Yeah.
": I would like to ask, though, with my Vercadian camaraderie just, like, kind of be like, I just upgraded to a moderate lifestyle. Can I keep my boa, my feather boa?"
": They look at the feather boa and they say... (dice rolling) One of them takes the feather boa and... (machine whirring) Wraps it up in a little thing and puts a weird little plastic egg around it to, like, lock it up. And it hands you the little locked up..."
": Amazing, that's cool."
": All right, I'll take what I can get. Someday, this is gonna turn into a beautiful feather boa. (everyone laughs)"
": So, your guys' equipment is taken away, including spell casting focuses, which I think only impacts the tech casters."
": You wouldn't take an old man's boots, right?"
": You see, they look at the boots and say, we absolutely would, we absolutely would."
": Are you sure, 'cause-"
": Yeah, 100"
: He's an old man.
: He's old.
: I'm an old man.
: Do you see how old he is?
": Give me your shoes. Yeah, give me your shoes."
": Give me your shoes, dude."
": Hey, give me your shoes."
: I'll give you these shoes if you give me regular shoes.
: I'll give you my shoes if you don't take his shoes.
: They're orthopedic.
: So you guys are given these truly bizarre lime green onesie pajamas.
: Kinda like that.
: I don't mind.
": I like to match with everyone, yeah, sure."
": Do we see where they're going to, where they're bringing our equipment to?"
": Yes, you see it is sort of taken off down a long hallway. You can track that movement as it moves away from here."
: Could I possibly send Handy Annie to follow?
: Give me a stealth check for Handy Annie.
: Do you know what's crazy? I don't know that I have her statistics.
": I think it's just Familiar statistics, so it's just going to be, I think, a plus... I think it's a plus six."
": Plus six, okay."
": And I'll just straight up let you know that the number you're trying to beat, to pass that perception, you're trying to beat an 18. So you're gonna need a 12 or higher."
: Easy.
": Oh, that's fine."
: Absolutely easy.
: Absolutely easy.
": It's a guarantee, y'all."
: Guaranteed nat 20.
: It's absolutely guaranteed.
: Can one of us give her the help action?
": Unfortunately, no, 'cause this is something that Handy Annie has to do on her own."
: Oh my gosh.
: And she will.
": And she will, and she can."
: Character development.
: You know what? I'm saving this.
: Oh my God!
: I'm saving this! We need this later. This is not the moment to lose her.
: I dig it.
: I think that's fair. My feet are cold.
: Myrmidon...
": Skip, are you all right?"
E: They didn't give you one of those sticky socks?
"A: No, that was just Zac talking."
": Myrmidon Station (imitates whooshing) turns in orbit over Onolo Dos. (upbeat music) You have been separated into a number of different holding facilities before you are moved to your final cell. You have these sort of power inhibitors on you, and Margaret and Sid, you are in one room together. Skip and Barry are in another. And then Gunnie, you are in a room with Riva sort of swimming in this glass bulb."
: Is Riva conscious again?
": Riva, you do come to consciousness, but this, there is this, like, hazy, psychic-inhibiting drug floating in the water here."
: Delicious.
": So you are definitely out of it. Just feel, like, hazy, unfocused, that you just don't have the ability to, like, bring solid attention or pinpoint focus to anything."
: Okay. Can I still communicate with people?
: Yes.
: Great.
": It's just me and, like, kind of high Riva, Just like, hanging out."
: Yeah. (laughs)
: This bulb makes your face look funny.
": Uh huh, yeah, okay. (everyone laughs) We are in danger, okay? This is really bad, Riva."
: This is changing the shape of your face when I do this.
: I have Academic Memory. Would I know the layout of this specific UFTP prison?
: Give me just a straight lore check. (dice rolling)
": Okay. What is lore? Oh, yeah, that is a 17."
": You don't know the layout of this one, but you do know UFTP brigs in general. Like, it's the same contractors that work on all your stations, so it's sort of like, it would be the same thing as like, knowing the architect even if you don't know the building. You also know that you are still within a very short distance of the hanger bay of your ship, right? Like, these space stations are big, but they're not like rec stations. They're not made to be grand and palatial. Everything is made with a sort of ruthless corporate efficiency, so there's not big, grand hallways. Everything's pretty tight and compact and close to everything else 'cause you're building a thing to exist in space, right? The more space you make, the harder engineering gets, the more you're having to heat and oxygenate places, so you would guess that you're probably at the center of a tight little coil of cell blocks, guard stations. You guys were maybe like a three or four minute walk away from the hanger bay of your ship, but when you got sprung, it wasn't like they let you wander off before they jumped on you, you know?"
: Yeah.
": So that would be what you get on that check. So, Sid and Margaret, you guys are in a room together. They give you the sort of power inhibitors, you know, both. They don't even care to check if you're psychic, they just put one on you. Tech focuses have been taken away. As an android, you are not wearing a onesie because your clothes are a part of your body, basically."
: But can I wear the onesie-
: The onesie's over them.
: Over them?
": You have shredded up the footsies of your onesie with your roller skates. It is just in tatters. But your gun hand, they can't do anything about."
": Yeah, yeah."
: So there's just a big cork in the top of your gun hand. (Emily laughs)
": I mean, when is there not with the amount of champagne that's happening here?"
: Rattling around in there.
": There's like, always a couple rattling around."
": The door opens, a group of guards walk in, and you see Lucienne Rex, not a hologram, enters the room and sits across from Margaret and Sid."
: Can I Minor Hologram-
: Tech inhibitor.
: Oh!
A: What was it gonna be?
: I was just gonna make Margaret look as hot as possible.
: My onesie isn't zipped up all the way.
: Then at least I do like a-
: Deep V.
: It's a really deep V.
": Almost like a blow dryer coming from my gun, so that it's like music."
": The cork hits me in the face, I have a black eye. (everyone laughs)"
: Your bangs are just like this.
": I'm sorry, Miss Margaret, I tried."
: You see Lucienne sits down.
: Hi.
": Turns to the guards behind her and says, you can leave. The guards look at each other and seem to think that's a strange order. And then she says, now. The guards leave the room and close the door. She very slyly hits something on a little wrist transponder, and you see the cameras in the room flicker with some kind of inner tech hologram of a conversation."
: I would like to secretly start Handy Annie recording.
": Go ahead and give me a technology check. You can do technology or sleight of hand, whichever you prefer."
: Technology. (dice rolling)
": Little GoPro. This whatever footage you record is gonna have a little Acme- Ashmun logo in the lower right, little watermark. She looks and says, glad you got off the Griivarr worlds."
": Yeah, me too, thank you for the heads up. What's going on?"
": Well, I was hoping you could tell me that. Do you know why I'm here?"
: No.
: She narrows her eyes and looks at you and says-
": Oh, oh. Are you trying to get people to sign up and come to your girlfriend's art show? Are you kinda out, like, kinda canvasing?"
": Sid really stifles the urge to be like, oh, shit!"
": Lucienne says, my fiance doesn't really do art."
: I agree. (everyone laughs) Did she laugh at that?
": She looks stunned and she goes, did you... Why are you bringing up art? Did you sort of... Did you see? Did you?"
: Yes.
": Okay. So, she's alive."
: Yes. What's going on? Why was she sick? What happened?
": She's not really sick. I mean, she might be, I don't know. I haven't seen her in, like, a couple nargons. So, okay. Cards on the table. I... Myself and Natalia are not really engaged. So, about a rigon ago, I, you know, you know what I was doing, I was working at UFTP, and I got this message from Damien saying, hey, there's a thing happening on Mirage. Can you go sort of check it out and sort of be, you know, person on the spot doing the day of coordination? And I sort of showed up and Natalia was there. You know, I was surprised that you weren't there, but maybe you were out on your ship. And she sort of took me aside and she was like, ''Hey, I noticed that you're really doing this great job planning this thing'', and I was like, ''Thank you so much, like, I'm a huge fan.'' And she was like, ''Would you be willing to come and just do some assistant work for me this weekend?'' And I was like, ''Well, I'm an executive.''"
: Yeah.
": But she's a Bajar, you know? And so I said, ''Hey, you know, if we can call it a different job title, I'd be happy to do it.'' And we kind of went on this getaway and there was a nudist colony and there was sort of a dance cycle and I think they burned someone inside of a big wicker minotaur. It was bad. It was really bad. It was a horrifying, bad time."
: Wow.
": Basically, she drank a bunch of this champagne, had a bad time, a bunch of sort of designer drugs, that she just told me that she was so tired of everything and she wanted to reinvent herself and that she had an in with this art commune. And she basically told me that she was going to destroy herself and that I needed to clean everything up and then submit to getting memory wiped. So she drove a speeder off of this sort of beautiful cliff that blew up, but ended up vanishing. And I was supposed to sort of turn myself in to get memory wiped."
: Does her family know? Does her family think that she's dead?
: I kind of whipped up some holograms for a proposal.
: I smile so big at her.
": She fucked me, you know? I was gonna be destroyed. I was gonna go and have to turn myself in and, like, explain all this stuff to help her. What I, you know, discovered was her faking her own death, but it was really unclear in how she explained it. Like, the plan seemed to change. I was like, ''Are you faking your own death, or are you really, is this the end?'' And she was like, ''Today, Natalia Cicero Connie Lee Carter Bajar dies.''"
: It's so long.
: It's a long name.
: It's so long.
": And she's like, ''I die today,'' and I was like, ''I've gotta know if this is a metaphor or if this is real.'' And she said, ''Every metaphor is real,'' and I really checked out at that moment."
": Yeah, definitely."
": Yeah, she's like, it's really easy to check out during one of those conversations. Can I ask, often someone who's going through something like this, ends up, like, revealing a bunch of, like... They're just like, fuck my family, I hate them. Here's a bunch of secrets about them. I mean, did she do a last divulge?"
: There were a lot of divulgences. None of them were important. But there was important stuff attached and gleaned to all of it.
: Yeah.
: So I was able to sort of scrounge up as much as I could. The important thing is this. Please don't tell anyone that Natalia is still alive Arcadia Prime.
: And not married to you.
": And not engaged to me, yeah, absolutely."
": But the partner always takes the fall. If she disappears, you're gonna take the fall. You're just gonna do holograms of her for the rest of eternity?"
: That's the plan.
": Okay, we can come up with a much better plan for you. You were never much of a big, of a good planner."
": Oh, I'm not much of a big planner?"
": No, you're not."
": So what happened with this complete meltdown, where now you're killing sheriffs on edge worlds?"
": He was bad, though."
: But I'm saying you've totally lost your mind.
": Okay, I get it. No, I haven't, I'm actually... Look, I'm more alive and sharp than I've ever been. What are you doing here? Are you trying... What are you doing on Rubian V? Does this have to do with Rubian V?"
": Yeah, answer that in one second, but I just want you to know, I've been working for Miss Margaret. She is the greatest boss I've ever had. We have come into money, resources, clout, we are powerful now, and that is all due to the direction of Miss Margaret. So how dare you assume that what she did is spiral when what she did is spiral upward? The ball is rolling up! Okay, I'm gonna go stand in a corner and let y'all have a private conversation."
: Yeah. Thank you.
": She looks over at you and says, you wanna know how we picked you up? You wanna know how much the ball is not rolling up?"
: Don't you dare say that.
: Don't you dare.
: Don't you dare use that phrase.
: That is honestly blasphemy.
: That's our phrase.
": You've gotta trademark that, guys."
": She takes a screen and clicks it and turns it towards you, and you see a weeping Auma Liu on the screen."
: Okay. (somber music)
": This is some security cam footage of Auma, who we made a very generous offer to, which she accepted."
: To give us up?
": 150 million credits. It's a lot of money. Wipes her eyes. Are you taking the time to consider it? You see Auma goes, I don't wanna be a sucker. I don't wanna... I don't wanna be dependent on anyone else. I just, I can't. Just, what's gonna happen to Sid? And you see Lucienne's voice, who you hear in the screen, goes, there is no interest in killing any member of Sid's ship or crew. They have an extremely important piece of technology. That's the only thing we're interested in. Once we get that off their hands, they are gonna be free to go. And you see she says, the only crew member that's going to have sort of a permanent detention is the Princeps Zortch, But that is related to Monarchy, and I think, Miss Liu, if you want to extend yourself on behalf of the Princeps, you're welcome to do so, but you will be greatly endangering the life of the android you seem to care so much about, and you'll be foregoing Auma looks up. It's a lot of money. There's a lot you can do with that much money. You see Lucienne says, yeah, that's correct. Do we have a deal? We just wanna know. We know that they contacted you while they were in the neutral zone. And you remember that nat one on that check. Okay. I'll make the deal. I'll tell you where they're gonna be. You see Lucienne slides a data card over to Auma Liu, and you see Auma looks up as, all right. You are being recorded, so this verbal contract is germane, legal, enforceable. You can go ahead and get that information. So you see she says, and then who knows? With that kind of money, maybe you'll be able to do something to help Sid. I know you're a big fan of the android that can do everything. And you see Auma whips up and looks and says, not everything, she can do anything. And looks into the camera, and you see this sort of wild look come over her eyes and go, she can do anything. She takes the card. If I'm lucky, I'll have a chance to... If I'm lucky. Lucienne sort of finally appears in the camera and goes, well, I don't know how lucky your stars are, Miss Liu, but here's hoping, and the recording ends."
": I understand why she did what she did. Now, I believe you two have personal conversations, so I'm gonna stand in the corner and stare into it. (Brennan laughs)"
": Okay, so you work for Crown and Scepter now. Are you working with Frangus?"
: What do you know about Frangus?
: I know everything about Frangus.
: How?
": I'm close with the Monarchy, with the House of Frangus."
": She looks around here and she says, okay, we need to talk. We're gonna cut from here to Skip and Barry. Door opens, one figure walks in."
: I'm doing pushups. (Ally laughs) You see Barry Nyne walks in.
: All the way in?
": All the way in. You guys here are, you know, you're seated, manacled to the wall. Barry Nyne steps in. Well, well, well. If it isn't my brother."
": I'm not your brother, bro. You're my brother. I'm talking to Barry Nyne, not you."
: And I'm talking to you. And are you my brother?
": Yeah, I'm talking to you. I think you know who I am, son."
"E: I knew it. Oh, I love it."
": You've been away from home for a long time. (Brennan imitates growling) Grabs your onesie, pulls you in. (liquid gurgling) And sticks his tongue in your eye. (everyone laughs)"
": Surely the worst part of this season, having tongues come into eyes."
": And you hear in your brain, Valdrinor."
: Father. (everyone laughs)
": You have been away for a long, long time. Drablian the Chamberlain spoke to you. It seems an android blew him up with a grenade."
: Yes.
: Did you not seek to mete out justice from the House of Frangus?
: Maybe you and I have different versions of what justice is.
": Justice, my boy, is the continuation of the line of Frangus, the Mentaphagian Dynasty. You have forgotten your place, your house! You were raised in a noble tradition."
: No one asked me if I wanted to be a part of this tradition. I want nothing to do with this dynasty.
": You would forego eons of tradition, duty, honor? Eons has the House of Frangus moved behind the powers of the galaxy."
": Barry, you're just seeing... (everyone laughing)"
": Skip, Skip, are you okay? Skip. (Brennan gargles)"
Z: Father! (everyone laughs)
": Why would you turn your back on this greatest of responsibilities? Don't you understand? Don't you understand the power of Mentaphage? We are behind the movements of the stars. Your little friend, the human woman, Margaret Encino, United Free Trade Planets is not a front for Crown and Scepter. Some pitiful house of bipeds, made to be chariots to the great cerebro-slug houses! United Free Trade Planets is ours. It has been ours for some time. We have made the great egg. The Emhatchening will commence. Do you wish to know the great vision of what is to come?"
": If you must tell me, I would hear it, but... (air whooshing)"
": Eggs throughout the galaxy. And here you see thoughts put into your mind by your father, King Prilbus, who begins to show, you know, all of the breeding, weird little hatchings of eggs and how cerebro-slugs normally breed, the corpses of the bodies, they take over the base of the sort of brain stem. (liquid gurgling) We are able to survive and reproduce, hated by all of the lesser beings of the galaxy, who seem so offended that great powers such as ourselves might use their pitiful bodies to bring about... (Ally gurgles) But we are small, our bodies fragile, and while we travel from host to host to find vessels to pilot for greater purpose, we are disgustingly at their mercy. But what if we were not so small? What if there were to be a great egg? You see Rubian V. Soon it will be hollow enough that the shell of the great egg may crack, and you see covered in pilgrims, burrowing into the earth and literally using the planet as its egg. The center of gravity, a hollow world, and you see he says, a slug the size of a planet, to burrow. And here you see the galaxy spinning. Burrow into the mind of Mother Void herself! You see the planet crack in half, and a vision of a slug the size of a moon, traveling at faster than light speed, to the black hole at the center of the galaxy."
: What the fuck?
": To eat the mind of Mother Void herself! To rule the universe for a thousand, thousand cycles!"
: This is like a Red Bull commercial. (everyone laughs) Absolute god complex.
: A slug just going
": Father, I hear your plan. I just have to get real with you. (everyone laughs) What? Listen. The House of Frangus, the monarchy of King Prilbus is very much yours and yours alone. I do not... Do you need me for this or are you sure?"
": Son, I do need you for this. Make a perception check here. Or actually, make a piloting check for me. (dice rolling)"
: Barry's just fully sat down at this point.
": I think they're fighting. Just like, kick his ass, Skip."
: 16\. I can add Defiant if that feels like...
": Add Defiant if you want to, yeah."
: Oh!
: 20.
: Ooh.
": Hell yeah. I'm gonna say Barry, as you're watching, you see a sudden movement as Skip shoves his tongue into Barry. (liquid gurgling) They're like, weirdly gripping each other's heads."
: 69 each other's faces.
": I can't reach them, right?"
": You can kind of, you can reach them probably a little bit."
": Can I help Skip? Essentially, like, grab this dude's mouth, I guess?"
": Yeah, you can try to get Barry Nyne's tongue."
: Oh!
": As you do, so you pull-"
: Ew!
": As you get your tongue into Barry Nyne's eye, you see a part of the vision, the giant slug, the House of Frangus moving through space to consume the galaxy. All of the cerebro-slugs will melt down their bodies, but you see a satellite in orbit over Rubian V that appears to be made out of, like, ancient cerebro-slug technology. You are, like, pulling these memories out of your father's mind. You hear, the fang of Frangus, the Frangus fang in orbit over Rubian V. The Great Emhatchening must be coordinated at a perfect moment, a perfect time to strike all at once, all together. For that kind of connection to the great egg, we would need one with the ability to speak in and to the great egg. And you see Princeps Zortch. And you see the Princeps in here."
: In the fang?
": In the fang, in this, like, satellite, with Barry Nyne behind the Princeps, like, at gunpoint, forcing the Princeps. You see all of the House of Frangus on the planet, burrowing into the planet in some weird genetic fusion, that their bodies, like, take up space, journey to form some, like, horrifying, psychic, cellular mitosis, to grow and grow and grow from the core of the planet, and eventually split the planet open. But of course, a dilemma, for we need royal DNA to create the Great Emhatchening."
: I already know what this is.
": But there should remain one cerebro-slug to direct this endeavor. Son, you will give your life to bring glory to the House of Frangus, and I will be there to direct this greatest of cerebro-slugs."
: Coward. (Brennan yells)
": And you see, Barry, you pull his tongue out."
": I love how Brennan was like, yeah, sci-fi genre, except my slugs, full fantasy. (everyone laughs)"
": A little bit. You know, there's just some ''Dune'' mixed in. Yeah, exactly."
: Just a high collar.
: A high collar. The House of Frangus.
: Just a worm in a high collar.
": That's one of my favorite books, ''The Worm in the High Collar''. (everyone laughs)"
: That was some crazy historical fantasy.
": As you call your father a coward, Barry, you pull him off."
: You would ask this of everyone?
": In this moment, you realize this is why Barry Nyne's been hunting Zortch. Zortch has a connection to the planet through their connection to Gnosis. And the Great Emhatchening needs to happen all together, right?"
: So does King Privis-
: Prilbus.
": Prilbus, yeah."
: Want to hop into Zortch's body?
": You see it looks like that is part of the plan, right?"
: Gross.
": Looks like that's part of the plan. 'Cause Zortch would have a connection to whatever this thing is, exactly."
: Is your dad a good cook? Because we actually do need a chef.
": We actually, yeah, how is we with-"
: There's no way he's ever cooked a thing in his life.
": You see Barry Nyne looks at you and says, very well. Stolen a little secret from me. You will submit to coming. You know why? Because you're soft. I'm gonna find Zortch, and when I do, you're gonna come to Rubian V. Because if you don't, my heroic, little son, I'm gonna kill your friends in front of you one by one. Think on that."
": Wait, they don't have Zortch?"
: That's news to you.
: Yeah.
": You see Barry Nyne turns to look at you and says, did you really wanna talk to him? (suspenseful music)"
: Yeah. (liquid gurgling)
": Barry, I'm scared."
: We'll get you out.
": I've been having a really bad dream, man. Where's Barry? Where's Dr. Barry?"
": Barry's right here and Barry's right here. Never forget, Barry's right here. (liquid gurgling)"
": When I leave this body, I'll make sure to leave it somewhere cold, where it dies slow."
: Barrys run hot. (everyone laughs)
: We cut over to the holding chamber with Gunnie and Riva in it.
": Riva's just inside the orb going, I am the ball and I am rolling up, and just doing little backwards somersaults. I am the ball and I'm rolling up! Gunnie, look at me, I'm the ball and I'm rolling up!"
": Uh huh, yeah, 100 God, why did I say that? Why did I say that?"
": Riva, you get a powerful psychic impression of the moment in the next room over when Skip seizes that secret vision, the things that his father was hiding from him. And you see that thing of Zortch within the Fang of Frangus, within this sort of sinister-looking alien satellite over Rubian V. And you see this like, it's almost an omen of the future, it's like a portent. This idea of, like, Zortch in this place where they will be able to trigger the Great Emhatchening with these billions of pilgrims on the surface of Rubian V, which are secretly just people from all over the galaxy taken over by cerebro- slugs."
: Stop flipping.
": No, I'm flipping 'cause I'm flipping out 'cause this thing's happening in the other room that are just big parental revelations."
": Oh, wait, there's big stuff going on in the other room? Come on."
": Yeah, let me show you, and I cast it over to Gunnie, so Gunnie sees all of this stuff as well."
": As you cast it over, give me an insight check. Give it to me with disadvantage, but give me an insight check."
: Come on.
": Oh, that was a nat 20, but with disadvantage, it's still very good, it's a 24."
: Ooh!
: Wow.
: I have 11 to insight.
: Even fucked up.
L: Even fucked up.
": You cast that out and you feel Zortch's presence somewhere in Myrmidon Station. You can't get a beat on it 'cause you're too out of it, but you sense Zortch loosely. It's echoey, it's like, you know when you hit two rocks together underwater and it sounds incredibly clear, but everything else is so muffled? There's this moment of connection from that psychic vision that's like rocks hitting, and you get another ping off of Zortch, that's clear, I know that Zortch is there, and then immediately it's muffled again. But you feel a connection to Zortch as you connect with Gunnie as well."
: Is there any way for me to psychically connect with them to communicate to them what's going on?
": Yes, you can communicate to Zortch."
: Ooh.
": Great. Hi, Zortch. Ssh. (Brennan imitates distortion) Okay, the connection's pretty bad, you're breaking up quite badly there, that's not great. Hello? Can you hear me?"
: I can hear.
": Are you okay? (Brennan imitates distortion) Okay, well, we're in jail and I'm on drugs. (everyone laughs) So there's not much we can do, but I'm glad you're okay. I don't know if you are hearing any of this, but I communicate all of the stuff that I saw from Skip over to them."
": So you communicate all that to Zortch, and as you do, Zortch, you feel the panic of Zortch seeing like, oh my God, this is why I'm wanted."
: Right.
"B: Like how much of this is terrible, et cetera, et cetera."
": So just so you know, just like, lay low. Don't worry about it. (Brennan imitates distortion) It's all good, the ball is rolling uphill, and I start flipping."
": You start flipping again. Gunnie, as you are looking at Riva, you're also, like, part of this whole conversation."
": Great, okay."
": As you go over to, like, listen into the other room, you touch a sort of area of the wall, and as your metal hand, you have your cybernetic stuff, you don't have your data pad here, you don't have your gadgeteer's harness, so there's no tech powers available to you, but you touch the wall. You have a lot of vital stuff in your cybernetic enhancements in your cyborg body, lot of sensors and things that constitute the senses you, you know. Things that constitute a sense of touch or kinesthetic sense, right? One of which is you have a little alert for electromagnetism, 'cause of course, that could totally shut your body down, it's incredibly dangerous, right? Little ion meter, as you touch the wall, it starts to register, which happens a lot if you touch walls with circuitry in them and stuff like that. But as you touch it, listening, 'cause you're there for a moment, in that sensor, you hear, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, in a bizarre rhythm that starts to come through in that sensor. Does Gunnie have any reaction to this as it occurs?"
": So as I move my hands over the wall, does it beep differently depending on where I put my hand, or?"
": There's sort of a, you can tell that there's some circuitry behind here where it's strongest."
: Uh huh.
": Which to you would mean that it feels like it's coming, it's part of the circuitry of the station."
: Does Morse code exist in this world? Is it some kind of like... Can I try and read that as a message of some kind?
": I'm gonna say, you said it exactly, no roll necessary. This is Morse code."
: I watched ''Squid Game'' this weekend. (everybody laughs) Spoilers for ''Squid Game''.
: This is coming out in months.
": You'll always know when we record, you know?"
: We guarantee you that.
": We guarantee that. So whatever is communicating to you doesn't have access to a communications technology, but it's just charging, it's pulling something from a server that it knows travels through this wall to trigger a latent thing that it knows is in your cybernetic enhancements to warn about powerful electrical presences nearby. And you start to put it together in your head and hear, Gunnie, this is Gnosis. Can you hear me?"
": I'm gonna shoot, I'm gonna overcharge the electricity in my fingers against the wall, responding back in the same pattern of just, like, yeah, read you loud and clear. Are you in the system?"
": Barely. I'm drawing on latent power from a charging station nearby, not registered to The Wurst, but I'm not attached to any kind of comm system. I can't connect to the internet. I'm suspended in my holofract right now."
: Got it. Could you in some way maybe get us out? And what would that take?
": Gnosis comes back to you and says, it's possible, but something is in control of me. I'm not sure what. I'm not... I could get lucky and get moved to an area where I could interface, but I'm not sure how I would do that under my own power in this instance. I need to be connected in order to be at my full strength, and right now, I have barely enough power to draw through a nearby transponder charging station to communicate this to you. So Riva, you're doing backflips, and you see Gunnie just like, tapping on the wall, so focused."
": Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click."
": Oh, he's hitting the wall with his finger. That's not a good sign."
: It's Gnosis.
: It's yeses.
: Gnosis is in the wall.
: Yeses.
: Are you still on The Wurst?
": Disconnected, I have no sensory apparatus. I can merely think. It's my ability to communicate with you here is because I am broadcasting this signal. I hoped that you would be prescient enough to observe it, but I truly don't know where you are or where I am."
": Got it, okay. Riva, your thing with communicating with Zortch, could you do that with anyone else? Like, could you reach out to our people and possibly touch base with them, even if the connection was fuzzy?"
": Yeah, I think so. Hang on a second. And I concentrate really hard and I imagine two rocks in my hands and just... (liquid gurgling)"
B: Give me insight with disadvantage. (dice rolling)
": Oh, yeah, that's a 25."
: Hell yeah. Who are you trying to reach out to?
: Who am I trying to reach out to?
": Just see if you can touch base with, I don't know, Barry."
": Oh, yeah, absolutely. I can hear Barry. I can smell Barry."
": Okay, cool, cool."
": Barry, hi. I've got a channel through here to Gunnie."
": Riva is coming through very clear, but muffled."
: Okay.
": Awesome. Okay. I am communicating with Gnosis and I just wanted to make sure that we can all be on the same page if there's the opportunity to do something, you know."
: We're very interested in doing something over here. I look at Skip. Interested in doing something?
: Yes.
: We're interested.
": Great, we're working on it. I'm gonna keep trying to see, you know, keep in touch with Gnosis."
": Gnosis says, if you can get in touch with someone that can see my holofract, I do not know where the Princeps is, but... You see it says, I'm reaching out to you. I can sense, I understand that the situation for you has greatly worsened since the last time we were in communication. I was reaching out to you to communicate that my work is done."
": Oh, they got a plan."
": So the plan is good for Rubian V, or your dissemination?"
": There is a possibility for total disbursement and its people, and perhaps even things yet unknown depending on the amount of power that we can locate. I believe I understand the programming behind dispersing myself and potentially reconstituting Rubian V in such a way that it will no longer be at threat of the designs that United Free Trade Planets has on it. In order to affect the plan that I have determined has the highest possible likelihood of success, I will need more than just a reconnection to my planetary supercomputer. I would need a ability to reconstitute to the planet while also being in perspective above and over it. (upbeat music)"
: Got it. I think I saw an image of a thing in the sky over your planet that I think we could make work.
: Does it have the possibility for psychic connection as well as telecommunications?
: I believe so.
": So as you're saying that, you're very aware that this is something that Gnosis is saying it needs, but this is also very much a thing designed by the cerebro-slugs."
: Yeah.
": So, this is the thing that Zortch has just been... Basically, you just told Zortch, like, here's the end of your life."
: Yes.
": And Gnosis is like, this is exactly what I need. Anything else that you communicate to Gnosis or Zortch in this moment?"
": Hey, buddy, we're gonna make that plan happen, all right? We'll see you soon."
": Cool. We're gonna cut back to Sid and Margaret. So Lucienne looks at you and says, what do you know about the House of Frangus?"
": I know a lot about the House of Frangus. (Zac laughs) I know all about King Prilbus. And if you want the information, I think we could work on this."
": Okay, look. After I got the promotion, I needed to keep plates spinning. And you know, I knew that war was breaking out in Rubian V. I also knew that there was a ton of mining happening on Rubian V. Look, the higher ups, I talked to the higher ups about, you know, Rubian V. They seemed fine with hollowing it out. And listen, there's a scheme there, too. UFTP is trying to fuck the galactic lithium trade. They're trying to create an artificial shortage so they can take the brigade and hold them over a barrel, right? They don't want to sell, they wanna hold a monopoly and jack up the price. And so I thought, okay, they're gonna destroy this world, that's nothing new for UFTP, but I found out about Gnosis. I reached out to the Princeps Zortch. They reached out to me, I thought, this is my shot. This is how I start to earn credit so that maybe I can start to phase out the Natalia thing, right? When I brought Gnosis up and tried to deliver it up the chain of command, people seemed uninterested. Literally, I said, I think there's a planetary supercomputer, revolutionary technology, XYZ, all this other stuff. People sort of went, huh? Whatever. We got our own plans for that planet. If we can mine that lithium out, we need to do that. And I said, but you might be destroying a unique piece of revolutionary technology. The only time they got interested is when I said that Griivarr was involved. And they looked into that, and then they said, ah, that's no big deal either. So I started to dig in. The House of Frangus. Look. King Prilbus."
: Prilbus.
: It is fun to say.
: Prilbus!
": So I started to look into it. And at first I was like, did these cerebro- slugs hit our executive suite? Did they take over the Bajars? Are they in Crown and Scepter? What the hell is going on? I found out that UFTP is hollowing out Rubian V to do it all, not only to fuck over the brigade, but also to create this, I don't know, religious artifact or whatever for the cerebro-slugs. They wanna do some wacky thing on the planet. And that's when I found out. I said, okay, this King Prilbus has gotta, like, have taken over a member of the Bajar family or someone at Crown and Scepter or someone else. We have security measures to make sure people don't get cerebro-slugged in our C-suite. It's not that big of a threat. UFTP signed a contract with the House of Frangus a couple of cycles ago to do this work on Rubian V to create this for them. In exchange for hollowing out the moon, which was their property, they asked the House of Frangus to deed over the holdings of every single one of their hosts. Right now, there's about 20 billion cerebro-slug host bodies on Rubian V. The hosts that UFTP asked them to target, because to the slugs, a body's a body. (upbeat music) The combined holdings of those pilgrims on Rubian V who are gonna, I don't know, do some weird, culty cerebro-slug thing at some point, when they bite the dust, their holdings all get deeded over to a trust owned by UFTP, somewhere in the windfall of five quintillion credits."
": Who are some of the... I say this still looking directly at the corner and not looking at them. Who are some of the, like, the most wealthy people who are part of this pilgrimage that might have left a family that then would say, what? Like, if we were to leak this information to them."
": I could pull up a ton of names for them and send 'em to you. I mean, we're talking about billions of people, the countless families all over the galaxy. You know, they're not all royalty, but they were asked to target people with holdings. We're talking not only liquid capital, we're talking properties and assets, technologies, patents, intellectual properties. So the super computer never mattered to them because once this great hatchening or whatever happens, we're gonna be in a market position to buy Griivarr, to buy any of our competitors outright. So, someone else takes Gnosis, that's why they never gave a fuck, because all they need to do is collect this windfall and they'll just buy whoever got their hands on Gnosis after the fact."
": Wow, Griivarr wouldn't like to hear that, I don't imagine."
": No, I don't imagine they would."
: Nor would Amercadia.
: Yeah.
: Can I do an insight check just to see if-
: Staring at the wall.
": I'm, like, looking at you, being like, you're laying it on a little thick. (everybody laughs) Yeah, they probably wouldn't. Now we're gonna have to worry about that."
": Can I do an insight check just on everything she's saying? Just like, is she totally putting her cards on the table?"
B: Give me an insight check.
": Okay, I have a plus one to that, so 12."
: You can't see her face 'cause you're looking at the corner. (everybody laughs)
: But what do I get with a 12 on the corner?
": With a 12 on the corner, she's either really processing what you said or left the room. (Ally laughs)"
: I don't know if she's here anymore.
: How do you play into all of this?
: I've been Natalia for the past rigon.
": Of course, okay. And you're ditching that and now you're doing UFTP. Do you wanna stop any of this?"
: No!
": Do you need our help with any of this, or you're just-"
: I need you to tell me where the fuck Gnosis is!
: Why do you also need Gnosis?
: Why? Why do you need Gnosis?
: Because I think the bosses are wrong. I think they're wrong. I think this technology matters. They're gonna kill a god to make money.
": What's your vision for a super computer? What do you think that it would change about the world, and what's your ideal version of, like, what we could do with it? I'm just curious."
": I don't know. Something cool. I know it's valuable. And you know, they said, okay, if Griivarr gets their hands on Gnosis, then we'll just buy Griivarr after the windfall. And I was like, you might not be able to, there might not be a Gnosis after the windfall if this thing destroys the planet or whatever. And so, you know."
": You seem... (gentle music) Like you're really involved in this and it all just boils down to weird, greedy people grabbing at different things. You're married to a weirdo that you're Weekend at Bernie'sing, propping up, like, a weird puppet. Do I have anything that I could show her our sizzle reel of Gunnie on?"
": You could tell her to put it on her phone, yeah."
: Can you pull up something? Can you go youtube.com? (Emily laughs)
: Go to youtube.com.
: Just put in greatest ever-
: Greatest ever.
: Cyborg-
: Cyborg-
: Man.
: Man.
: Best of.
: Best of.
: Totally owned.
B: Totally owned.
": A plane scape, the sun rises. Since the dawn of time."
": This is my life now. I live on a hotdog ship, there's a casino on it. You can do anything that you want."
: So what am I supposed to do?
": Uh, kiss me."
": What, like this? And you see smack, she's just rolling on the table with you."
": I'm still staring at the corner, but I'm smiling."
"B: Okay, give me another insight check."
S: Finally.
": Ooh, that's a dirty 20."
": Hey, that is a dirty 20. (everybody laughs) Incredible."
": I would do like a, yes."
": So yeah, you and Lucienne fully hook up."
: Cute. Wait.
: Cute?
: You stop at a certain point.
: I tie my-
": It's just a passionate, like, kiss."
: A passionate kiss.
": I go, long over due. Come on the hotdog ship."
": La, la, la, la, la."
": She looks at you and says, I can't come on a hotdog ship with you. Like, what happened? We had a plan. The Platinum Cog, we were gonna look out for each other."
: Exactly. The cog. You cannot tell me that you aspire to be a Platinum Cog. It's still a cog. You can hop out and then you can become...
: A rusty machine?
: A ball that's rolling up.
: What?
": No more cogs. Instead, you're a ball, and it's rolling up, baby."
: What is that a reference to?
: Snake eyes. And I roll some dice. (everybody laughs) Season is over.
": As you roll, you say... (everyone laughs) Before you roll, you say, snake eyes. During a social interaction, you say... You are speaking to another person. Has nothing to do with dice. You say snake eyes before the dice come up. Dice had not even been rolled."
: Snake eyes.
: Margaret has presumably not had dice at all so far.
": Yeah, you smuggled, the one thing you chose to smuggle into your cell is a pair of dice."
": Okay, everybody, yeah."
: Snake eyes.
: They have the name of our casino on them. They're promotional dice.
: Promotional dice.
: Big Barry's Casino.
": That is a good point, though, because Miss Margaret is building an empire right now, and if you don't jump on this opportunity, you might be begging to be an intern later."
": Yeah, you could be my intern."
: Go ahead and make a persuasion check for me. And I'll say with Sid that you get the help action.
": I whispered to Gunnie, there's some spicy things going on in the girls' room."
": Gnosis, there's some real spicy stuff going on."
: Persuasion?
: Persuasion.
: Spicy stuff going on-
: 27.
L: In the girls' room.
": She looks at you and says, I read the reports, you almost died. It was on the rec station news. You tumbled out of a crow's nest and a Vercadian Protector droid in a corn costume almost chopped you in half."
: Yeah. And I've never felt more alive.
: She kisses you again. (Ally laughs) And snake eyes.
: Snake eyes!
": Can I just, like, power down so they can... I go like this and they can just absolutely go to town. Just turn me back on when it's over. (energy powering down)"
: Okay.
": She looks at you and just goes, how did you know that we were here? How did you anticipate that we were gonna grab you on the station?"
: What do you mean?
: Do you want me to pull it out of you? Obviously you hid Gnosis.
": Yeah, I mean..."
: Give me deception.
": Oh, fuck. Yeah, we, okay."
": I'll tell you, what you've gotta beat right now is a 28."
: Can I have Handy Annie give the help action by ramming into Margaret's back so that her posture is really good?
: Yeah!
: This is what we wanna use Handy Annie for?
: Yeah!
: It's 21.
": 21, cool."
: So you don't have Gnosis.
: And you don't have Gnosis.
: And you don't have the Princeps Zortch.
": Look, if you just give us Gnosis, you get to go! What's the harm, what's the problem? Give us Gnosis. Give Zortch to the cerebro-slugs."
: Definitely.
: And you get a ship. You get to live your fun life!
": You're aware that Gnosis is like her own person? She's a fully walking woman. She's kind of, like, pushing mid fifties, and she's on our ship at all times, and you can just talk to her, right?"
: What?
: That's what Gnosis looks like.
": Gnosis, she'll say, gimme a smile."
: She's mostly gambling.
": Now, here's the deal. I'm gonna ask for a deception roll. So go ahead and give me a deception roll."
": With advantage, surely."
": Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, it's a straight deception roll. Go ahead and give me deception."
: Snake eyes.
: Snake eyes.
": Snake eyes. Oh, no!"
: Snake eyes.
: That is a 16.
: Okay. This is a plus (everyone chattering)
: Snake eyes!
: Snake eyes!
": That's a 10. 21, okay. So you see she says, the super computer is an old woman who's gonna tell me to give her a smile?"
: Does that sound strange to you?
": You can stay here for as long as you want. And if you just... Look, we have a lot to talk about. I'm not in a great position in the company until I get my hands on Gnosis. I did a lot of things without consulting people and a lot of things behind people's back. The Obfusion Arms? That blew up in my fuckin' face, Margaret. You put me in a bad position by whatever the hell you pulled off there."
": Well, I mean, I need to talk to everybody."
": Tell us where the super computer is and give us the Princeps, and you get your fun life back. And here you see that she shows the screen with Gunnie doing like a sick... (Lou imitates gunfire)"
: That was so sick. That was so sick. I'm so fucking proud of him.
": While this is happening, what is this cell like? Are we talking classic prison bars?"
": No, not classic prison bars. You're in like a steel door sort of holding area. It's all very white."
: I have an idea that you're wearing on your god damn shirt. The hubris.
: I would like to reach out to the Galactic Girl Guides psychically.
B: Cool.
: It's a deception...
: Oh.
S: Is it insight with disadvantage?
": Give me insight with disadvantage, yeah."
": Okay, that's a 17. (Brennan mumbles) Hello, little girl. Small human child, are you there? (Brennan mumbles) You sound like you're underwater, but I'm underwater, actually. (Ally laughs) (Brennan mumbles) Oh, okay. You know, if you break us out, we'll buy some cookies. (Brennan mumbles)"
": $1 million worth of cookies, we'll buy 'em."
": No, don't drop us down."
": No, that's too many."
: We'll lie to 'em.
": No, we can't lie to children!"
": Okay, fine."
: We'll give you 100.000 credits worth of cookies. We'll buy 100.000 credits worth of cookies.
: Deal. (everybody laughs)
": If you break us out, okay."
: Amazing.
: Do we think that was a good plan?
": Well, I was going to also, maybe... I was gonna see if Handy Annie could open this door or if Handy Annie could... Basically, I figured if Margaret, and what's her name again? And Lucienne could, like, maybe start going at it, that would be like, I could maybe disarm the key, sneak out."
: I'm gonna say at this point-
A: Do we roll for going at it?
": Roll for going at it. Lucienne just looks at you and says, you got plenty of time to think about it, Margaret. We just want Gnosis and the Princeps, and then it all goes back to however you want it to be. Give me an insight check."
: Okay. (dice rolling) That is 19.
: Lucienne's unhappy.
: Yeah.
": Scared. Your perception check was high enough to convince her of the truth of your statement, that she could be happier living the life you are living right here and now. So whatever motivation she had that was like, Margaret's a fool and I'm living a better life, that's gone. What it did not get rid of is the amount of danger Lucienne is in. And you see that that is what is motivating her here in this place."
: So what do you need? You just need Gnosis.
: I just need Gnosis.
": She's not an old woman. That's an old woman that gambles on our ship. I just need to be honest with you, starting now."
: Her name is Bambi LaRoux.
": Her name is Bambi LaRoux, not Gnosis."
: So please leave her alone.
: You can return Miss LaRoux to the... (everybody laughs)
"L: Thank God, thank God."
": Can I ask you, where did Auma go? It seemed like from the video that you just offered her the money and presumably freedom, right?"
": The last time Auma stuck her neck out for someone, I think it was you, she got fired and her life got sucked down the drain. I think it's pretty reasonable that she wouldn't make that same mistake again. To my knowledge, she... And here you see she... She opens a transponder and looks at it. Oh. Weird, okay. It looks like she's made a bunch of investments with it."
": What did she invest in? I see a droid, kind of like their makers, like their mommy."
": She says, HAC."
: What's that?
: Handy Andi Corporation. And you see that-
": She knows, 'cause we didn't we tell her about the fact that she owns the trademark? So she's investing in them."
: Before she takes it over.
": Before she does it. Is she still on this planet, though?"
": I believe so, I think she's still on... Yeah, she should be."
: Okay. But she's safe here.
: She gave you up and you wanna know if she's safe? (gentle music)
": She didn't give me up. I mean, she ensured my safety like any mommy would."
: I can't be around androids.
": Okay, listen, Lucienne, we can work on this, but we all, I have to talk to everybody else. It seems like we have to compare notes or something."
": Fine, think about it. You'll have time. She gets up, leaves. You guys are moved to now individual cells. You are in a bulb off in a corner of the room. The rest of you guys are in individual cells. You still have the dampener-"
": Is there a way to press, like, stop on the recording I did of everything she just said, and like, essentially, like, send it to... What is it, IQ, AQ?"
: The cloud?
: What's the name of it?
": Oh, to like, upload everything? Or SQ, the ship's computer."
": Yeah, yeah, to almost, like, mail it."
: I'm gonna say give me a DC 15 technology check.
": Oh, I got a 16 plus eight, 24."
": As you are walking, Handy Annie begins to upload."
: Cool.
": And uploads that to the ship's computer. So, you guys are here in the cell block. Dampeners on different powers, no equipment. What you see is... The only sort of interactions you have as you guys are sort of spending time here are you're not let out of the cells, a tray of weird, gooey food is slid in to like, a little sort of, like, drop box. They close the other side and then remotely, sort of like an airlock, right? So like, tray goes in, comes out, you eat. It's very high security, but they're not here to torture you guys. When you're done with the meal, you slide the tray back into the little airlock area and someone picks it up and takes it away."
: Can I actually not finish my meal and shove Handy Annie inside of it as I pass it out?
": Oh, I need to check something, though. Hold on a second. (gentle music) That is a two, which is so incredibly low, one of the guards does not recognize that you are an android and slides a meal through the slot for you. (Ally and Emily laugh)"
": So then yeah, I kind of wanna be like, oh, actually, I'm a droid, I don't eat. Thank you so much, though. And then, like, hide Handy Annie under it."
: Cool.
: So that she can essentially be out.
: Can I do an insight check and make friends with the guards? So I just keep like getting connected with them psychically.
": Sure. Yeah, make a psychic connection with the guards, yeah."
: 19.
": So yeah, you see this guy coming along. He's just sort of in the raspberry purple UFTP colors."
: Hi.
: How's it going?
: What's your name?
: My name's Phil.
": Phil. That's a great color on you, Phil."
": Oh, thank you, I appreciate that."
": I'm assuming it's some aspect of red. I can't see it fully, but from my perspective, very nice."
": Oh, that's so-"
: You like it here?
": Yeah, I like it."
: It's a good job?
: It's a good job. I like it.
: Are they treating you well?
: Yeah.
": I just learned about a new thing recently, and it's called a union. Do you know about that?"
: Heck yeah.
: That's great. Well...
": We have a couple different kinds of flakes. We have a chipotle. We have, this is sriracha with flakes."
: Very spicy.
": They're all spicy, yeah."
": I'll take all of them, but if you could turn off the thing that can make me do psychic things, 'cause it was actually quite painful."
: Okay.
": You know, just sentient being to sentient being."
": Here's my whole deal. They told me I'm allowed to chat and pour flakes, and anything other than that, I'm not allowed to do."
": Well, that's exact, that's exact."
: Yep.
: So good for you.
": How many guards are in this room? Well, there is a highly populated guard station you walked past. There is not a guard present in this room at all times. Like, this guy, Phil, comes in with, like, meal trays to, like, put them in and out."
": Oh, great. Phil, I can make you watch a movie if you like. And I start casting my memory of ''Fast and the Furious 200''."
: He stands there passively taking in all of the ''Fast and the Furious''.
: Would you say he's incapacitated? (Siobhan laughs)
": No, I would not say he's incapacitated."
: They don't seem that smart.
": No, I know, I just have to incapacitate him before I try."
": Oh, I see, okay. Then I guess, like... So Handy Annie's kind of getting brought out, and I'm wondering if she can, like, 'cause I can kind of see through her. I kind of just wanna see if she's seeing the area that we're, you know, that our ship is."
: May I ask for a stealth check for Handy Annie to get out on the tray?
: Does she have advantage because she's underneath a sandwich?
B: Yes. Plus six.
: 17.
": 17, okay. She gets by Phil on a"
": I think maybe when she gets set down, like, I'm assuming she gets set down at some point and then they walk away, and so I think she would use that to maybe then scuttle back down and try to start picking locks."
: So you wait for the tray to be put down?
": I think so, yeah."
: Cool. Phil walks for a while with your tray.
": Okay, well, when she's about to be 100 feet away, then she will have to jump out."
": Cool, give me stealth with disadvantage."
: Can I scream?
": Sure, yeah, just give me straight stealth. (Zac screams)"
: Okay. 14.
: Cool. So you just are
": Yeah, just 'cause if she gets 100 feet away from me, then I can't see through her eyes anymore anyway, so she would have to jump off."
": Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. You're not too far outside of the cell block. There's no one out here right now, but Handy Annie is loose and Phil keeps walking down with the tray."
": Great. So whoever's cell block is the closest, she's gonna try to pick that."
": Incredible. Handy Annie scuttles back into the cell block. As she does, you look and see these areas here. These are not physically locked from within this room. There's a control station at a guard station somewhere. It's remote."
": Okay. I guess, like, with tracker droid interface, I wouldn't be able to see through her, but can I send her to try to turn it off? I think she can still exist 100 feet from me, I just can't compute."
: So you're gonna have to give her an instruction to follow 'cause she's going to leave your communication range.
: Can I? Okay. If she came over to me and I spit my little slug body out of my nose and grab Handy Annie.
: The slug in hand?
": And we go to the guard station, maybe I could find a sleeping guard to take out."
: I love this.
": Also, I realized I have two abilities that have very similar names. And so when I was doing Consume Mind, the roll 3d6 thing, that was only to stun a target. Body Thief is a contested intelligence-"
": Oh, shit."
: Contest with an incapacitated target.
": Okay, so then I'm-"
: And I have a much better chance of doing that.
: I am absolutely going to send Handy Annie to wait outside of Skip's cell to carry the brain slug.
: Do I have a sense of how long that would take? Am I better at doing that now?
": I think you are, yeah, absolutely. You confronted your father, King Prilbus, for the first time in cycles, and you see Sundry Sidney's little Handy Annie (imitates skittering) skitter over to the other side of this tray lock. (liquid gurgling) Skip, you eject from your body craft (yells) and hit the ground, inch along the ground until you feel a familiar android's hand pick you up."
": Oh, you're so small!"
: As Norman Takamori comes to.
: I didn't do it! (everyone laughs) Their heads exploded! (everyone laughs)
": As Norman Takamori comes to, Skip, our friend, riding an android's hand."
"E: As Handy Annie leaves my, like, frame, or like my radius of communication, I say,"
"Sid: Be careful, Annie, that's precious cargo."
"B: And that's all for this episode of ""Dimension 20""! Tune in next week for a slug riding a hand."

": There has been a breach in the air lock! Get the hell outta here or you're gonna die with the rest of 'em! Riva, can you link me with Skip?"
: The real Skip.
": Yes, the real Skip."
": Yes, I can, but he's not gonna be happy. He's gonna be so mean to me."
": It's just that idiot, Gunnie."
": Yeah, I know."
": Hey, there's been a big, old breach in the airlock. Get outta here. It's our fault. It's 100% our fault."
: You idiots.
": Yeah, I know."
: Everyone is out to get me.

: I was the man who hacked him.
: What we have to do is get all of them to a better prison.
: Let me go!

Brennan: A lot of drinks at the table today and we're feeling fun.
: Feeling fun.
"Brennan: And we're feeling fun. Last we left off, our intrepid heroes..."
: Ah!
"Brennan: Were in the clutches of United Free Trade Planets. A wholly owned subsidiary of Crown and Scepter Ltd. Aboard the brig of Myrmidon Station. However, all hope is not lost. Indeed, great revelations were made! The nature of the great Emhatchening and the cowardice of King Prilbus who had sacrificed his only son, Prince Valdrinor."
: Father!
"Brennan: Father! On the sacrificial altar of the Great Emhatchening. We learned about the secret plan for the United Free Trade Planets, the only faction that seemed uninterested in capturing Gnosis and why? Because they stand to make more money if Gnosis dies. Five quintillion credits deeded over to United Free Trade Planets. Foul play is afoot. However, we also heard through morse code and psychic contact from our allies, UFTP doesn't seem to be able to track down where they are. How strange, given that you left them on the ship. What could it all mean? But we know that Gnosis has a plan. A plan that the only thing they need in order to enact this plan is a way to interface with their planetary corpus while maintaining in contact with the galactic satellite grid. If just such a satellite exists, however, such a satellite would be exactly where King Prilbus needs the Princeps Zortch to go. The Fang of Frangus in orbit over Rubian Five. A lot going on and, as of this episode, increasingly little time to solve it all. Also, Lucienne and Margaret made out and I won't, and that's pretty big too."
"Ally: We hooked up, okay."
: Just two friends who hook up.
: Up!
: In prison.
"Ally: Yeah, I am a big fan of her, okay. She's very cool and finding out that she's actually been completely lying about being engaged to someone and made up the whole thing, that's cool. When it was like, what about when I called her? It was like, you called me, you mean? And I was like, touche, you're hot."
"Brennan: Touche, you're hot. And that's the mantra of the season. We are going to go to TaleSpire. Once again, thanks to all of our incredible crew at the art department. TaleSpire and Hero Forge for this amazing prison block here. We see a guard traipsing down the hall here, coming in to do a little checkup. We are not going to enter initiative, because as of right now, no initiative has been rolled. However, we do have a little android hand, with a little slug riding on top of it."
": It has a little calculator watch on it, if you wanna..."
: Do some math?
": Like, play."
: Do some calculations.
: Write the word boobs upside down.
": Zero, zero, eight."
"Brennan: So notice where your characters are in this place. There's an aquatic cell over in the corner. Across from that is Barry. Gunnie, sort of caddy- corner to Riva and Barry's cells. Sort of in a split cell here we have Margaret. And now, once again, Norman Takamori."
: Oh no! Ugh.
: I didn't kill him!
": Aw, poor guy."
Lou: Norman Classic.
"Brennan: Norman Classic. And we also have Sundry Sidney over by the door here. There are some other cells here in the block as well as a guard, other prisoners as well. However, we're gonna go to Handy Annie. What is Handy Annie doing as you drop onto the metal plating of the station?"
"Emily: I think Handy Annie is just like stealthing along. Like now, I basically told her, like, basically she's listening to orders from the slug now."
": Oh, perfect."
Emily: Yeah.
: Great.
"Emily: So you can kinda just pilot her, because you're a pilot."
"Brennan: I am going to, well, that's very interesting because there is no brain for you to interface with on Handy Annie, I'm afraid."
"Emily: If that was the case, I was telling her, like go look for our spell casting focuses. Look for the control pad to stop it. So she was on a mission to where people would be."
"Brennan: I'm gonna say, give me a piloting check with disadvantage on top of this hand."
"Zac: Yeah, could I just like tap whatever finger as a direction, you know? Disadvantage. That is going to be a 15."
"Brennan: Okay. You don't have anyway to glean sensory apparatus from this hand, except for tactile. So you can feel when the hand, you can feel the movement of the hand, but none of your cerebro-slug senses are going off like there's a brain nearby. There's something I can latch unto. So this is just a piece of machinery moving along."
Zac: So I don't have eyes?
"Brennan: You don't have eyes or ears. You right now are on, you're along for the ride on top of a hand."
": Okay, then she's just heading to try and find where the guards, like where she could maybe turn off the system."
"Brennan: You are, I will say, like obviously, much smarter than this hand. It's just that you're very limited in your sensory information. So you can feel the hand moving. You can feel it turning. You can feel air on your body. You have a sense of the dryness of the area that you are in. But you also don't necessarily have a means of communicating with this hand, other than you wriggling on top of it."
: Okay. Wow.
": So, yeah. Limited, limited here. Amazing, so Handy Annie is gonna go off in search of… Oh wait."
: Is there any way to like...
": Make another, sorry."
": Can I talk to Margaret? Or can I talk to Riva, who can talk to Sid to talk to..."
"Brennan: Riva is partially drugged, but actually, you could use Riva's latent... What's the range limit on your telepathy? We don't know? Let's find out."
Lou: Let's find out.
Ally: I love that we're all in these little pajamas.
"L: Yeah, I feel like Gunnie's playing a harmonica right now."
(Lou mimicking harmonica playing)
": And they're like, where did you get that?"
: A freebie as part of your skeleton.
E: You just break it out.
": Yeah, it just comes with it."
"B: Okay. So, yes. Riva, go ahead and give me insight with disadvantage."
S: 19.
"Brennan: Okay. You can connect, again hazily, but right in front of you you see the hand kind of skitter by. You can connect mentally with Riva. And Riva can connect mentally with Sid."
: I need to find one of their bodies that is incapacitated.
": Oh, well there's this guard. There's this guard."
Zac: Is he asleep?
"Siobhan: Oh, he needs to be asleep?"
Z: He needs to be incapacitated.
"S: Oh, okay."
"Z: I can't just like, yeah."
"S: You can't just, okay."
": Oh, it needs to be incapacitated."
"Zac: Yeah, so is there like a guard rest area?"
": So no one has any other? Yeah, so I think it's like, so I guess I'll tell Sundry Sidney to look for an asleep guard."
: Okay.
S: Can I maybe use my psychic abilities to see if I can hear any like?
: Feel nearby?
"Siobhan: Weird like delta waves, or whatever, sleep waves."
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead. Give me a perception check this time. Still with disadvantage."
"S: My perception is not as good, that's a 12."
Brennan: Okay. In the humming of the station you are having a hard time picking up anything nearby.
: Mm-hm.
"Brennan: But as you were being moved here, you did feel dreams, but you can't pick up if that's how far or close away. So you can't pinpoint location, but it's not necessarily a bad idea."
"R: Okay, so there might be somebody sleeping here, but I'm not entirely sure where, I'm sorry."
Skip: That’s okay.
"B: So as you communicate that from Riva, Handy Annie, I'm going to need a stealth check from Handy Annie."
": If I have pretty good stealth, is there anything I can do to help that, or?"
": I mean, couldn't we all, in our cells, start making a ruckus?"
"B: Cool, if Riva communicates to everybody to start making a ruckus."
"R: Everybody start making, Phil, I have some questions about your life. Phil, come here."
"Brennan: You hear, yeah, Phil turns around to walk over. So yeah, the guard was gonna be coming back down the hallway after Handy Annie comes over and goes,"
"Phil: Hey, any questions, what's going on?"
"Riva: So, what's your deal? Are you like, in a relationship? I'm not coming unto you, I'm just interested in your life. What's your deal? What?"
Phil: I am in a relationship.
"Riva: That's great, who? What's their deal?"
": With our Lord, Zed."
": Oh my gosh, that's great!"
: I just start screaming.
: That's so good to hear!
: Who is Zed?
"Phil: Well, Zed dangled so that we could all be free."
: Praise Zed!
: Dangled!
": Um, wow."
: So is this enough of a commotion to give Handy Annie?
Brennan: You will have advantage on stealth.
"Emily: She doesn't even need it, she crit."
: Ah!
Emily: If I crit twice.
": Oh my god, if you crit twice."
"Emily: If I crit twice, what does it mean?"
Brennan: It means we just move to the next map.
"Emily: Oh, I didn't."
"Brennan: Oh, okay. Cool, cool, cool. Incredible. I'm gonna say on a nat 20, Handy Annie skitters forward. Also, on that nat 20, Skip, you touch the GoPro that is like embedded in Handy Annie. As you do so, this GoPro, I mean this is not necessarily how GoPros work but this is the future. This obviously has the ability to record sound in it as well. Because you're touching a speaker, the sound becomes tactile for you. And so at the very least--"
": Oh, like tremor sense?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can tell if there's people talking. You can tell like, if there's sound or something like that it's being picked up, it vibrates a little bit more and you can tell that you're closer by."
(skittering sounds)
[Brennan] Hand skitters forward.
": Yes, she does."
"Brennan: You completely stealthily move forward. You are in this next holding area with a sealed blast door. You see the stairs going to either side. So, Handy Annie scoots up. And how far away, it's"
": Yeah, 100 feet and then I lose contact with her."
: Let's actually see. Because it might not be 100 feet. Let's find out. You're here.
"Brennan: That is more than 100 feet. Okay, so Handy Annie's just up in there purposefully hidden. There is a sealed door and there are a couple of guards in here in the station."
Zac: Do I seek any minds that feel?
"B: Oh yeah! You feel minds near you. Yes, there are prison guards all throughout here."
"Z: So for that ability to work, they have to be incapacitated."
"Ally: I mean, there's a whole room with beds."
"Siobhan: Yeah, you just have to get through these blast doors."
"Zac: Yeah, so I'm hearing there are guards in here. I'm trying to decide what if anything, do I feel more minds beyond this door?"
"Brennan: You do, yep."
"Zac: Okay, well I would like to communicate that to Riva."
: I think I'm out of range of her.
Zac: Gotcha.
: You kind of just have to be.
"Brennan: So where we're at now is it's basically just Handy Annie and Skip, this lonely little slug riding on a hand."
Zac: And can I just like point towards that for Handy Annie?
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely. So, you tap. So, Handy Annie feels a tap from the slug on top of like, off in a direction. Handy Annie heads off. You get to the top. You are hidden in the shadows. No one has spotted you. Handy Annie is perfectly stealthy. With those blast doors in front of you, you have a decision to make. Obviously, these people are active. The blast door right now is closed. It's a button on the console right in front of them to open it. However, doing so would almost certainly, you know, they would be looking at a hand walking across a thing and tapping a button. Or you come up with some other way of getting into the blast door. There is no puzzle here. This is simply how this prison works."
Zac: I wanna communicate to Riva.
"Skip: I think we need a big, big distraction. Whatever y'all did earlier, something like that but."
"Emily: I have a gun for an arm, so I'm just gonna start shooting my door."
"Brennan: Clunk, clunk, clunk. And you just start shooting the door."
"R: I can feel my psychic powers coming back to me. Any moment now. You better watch out, everybody."
Margaret: Gnosis is here!
(laughing)
B: Give me deception.
"A: Okay. Oo, that's a lot! That's like, 16 plus..."
"B: Hell yes, the blast doors rocket open as prison guards, about like six prison guards. So those three in the station right in front of you and then another three from beyond them all rush down and say,"
"Guard: Hey, stop shooting the door!"
Guard: Stop getting your psychic powers back!
"Sidney: I am so sorry, it malfunctioned. Usually my powers help me keep it under control."
Zac: I'm tapping Handy Annie.
"Siobhan: I whisper in their heads,"
"Riva: It's too late, I'm already in here."
(laughing)
"Riva: Oo, I'm in your little brains and they're disgusting."
(laughing)
Brennan: Incredible. Go ahead with this enormous distraction. Give me another stealth check with advantage as you rush to the next into the next room.
Emily: 21.
"Brennan: 21\. Handy Annie skitters into the next room. Many of the guards in here have momentarily left to rush past. So you wait, as they rush past you sneak out. Again, brightly lit in here. But it's a space station. There's not vermin running around. You know, it's like no one's looking down for a little thing that skitters out of sight. You are hiding."
Zac: Can I make a perception check in here now?
"Brennan: Yes, go ahead and make a perception check for me."
Zac: Pretty good. 24.
"Brennan: 24\. One of the doors on the right hand side has sleeping, has incapacitated people behind it."
: Tap on Handy Annie.
: Tap on the right side of Handy Annie.
: Like a horse pull.
": Your weird tail is like, pop, pop."
Brennan: Incredible. You arrive. Which of the doors do you go to? The near one or the far one on the right side?
"Zac: On that 24 would I have a sense of which room, it was just on the right?"
"Brennan: Just on the right is where you felt, you can just sense."
Zac: I guess the first one on the right.
Brennan: You go to the nearest door?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. You are camped out, sort of under the lip, out of sight. By the way, that invisibility to cameras thing."
L: That only lasts 10 minutes.
": Okay, copy that."
: Dang.
"Brennan: So, you are not only making. You, in effect, are making these stealth checks even if there's nobody present in the room. Because there's always someone watching, right? You camp out underneath the lip of this door here. You have gotten past this incredible checkpoint. However, a new problem arises. Which is, now you're outside of this door. It doesn't look like, it looks similar in make, but obviously is not locked like that giant blast door was. But the problem is this, there's no ability to create a distraction for someone to wanna open this door."
"Emily: Yeah, because you want them to stay asleep. Do you have anyway to make smells? You could make the smell of fresh brewed coffee."
Zac: I don't have that ability.
"Ally: You don't want them to wake up, right?"
Siobhan: You don't want them to wake up.
"Zac: I don't have that ability, unfortunately. I have two things I can do. I can do my body thief thing, but I can also use consume mind to maybe make them go to sleep, I guess. The target is stunned. Is stunned different than incapacitated?"
"Brennan: Yeah, stun is different than incapacitated."
"Zac: Okay, so that won't help me take over a person, right?"
Brennan: Yeah.
S: Can I go into their mind and sing like a lullaby?
"B: Unfortunately, no."
S: Really soothe them.
Emily: That'd be wild. I recently watched Inception. I was impressed by how quickly people fell asleep.
Siobhan: I know!
"Zac: Okay, so I this door in front of me. I can detect that there's like a mind or something behind."
: That's so funny and a decade late.
"Brennan: Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely."
: Ew! Gross.
: How could you not finish something--
: That's you.
: Ew!
": Oh! Wait, that's how big he's been all along?"
"Lou: That would be unreal if it was that. I mean, pfft."
": That's not, yeah, horrifying."
Emily: He would be crushing Handy Annie.
Brennan: Incredible.
"Zac: All right, so it's like an airtight door. Can I--"
: Could be a waiting game.
"Zac: Are there still people in this room, or?"
"Brennan: Yes, you sense awake people. Awake and alert people. Actually, pretty highly alert right now because of the ruckus. You know, you open the door but at the cost of like a very alerted group of guards now."
"Zac: God, can I make like a sleight of hand check or something to try to open this door? Or like a stealth and sleight of hand?"
": Or maybe Handy Annie could also make a sleight of hand to open the door. And then whoever, comes. Oh no, because you need. You don't wanna wake anyone up."
"Brennan: You absolutely can make a sleight of hand to open this door. In order to do so, you will have to scale the door going to eye level with the rest of the guards. Very risky, but a possibility."
: Okay.
"Emily: If you guys crawled up and just unlocked it, it might be like quiet enough that it would creak open and only someone who was awake would notice."
": Right. I think, yeah, I think that is generally what--"
"Ally: Wait, but you know like microwave popcorn?"
: Sure.
Ally: Could you make that smell?
(laughing)
: What a really soothing lavender and chamomile?
Siobhan: Can we go through like the air ducts that we know exist? They would be perfect for that.
": Yeah, Loose Duke it. Can we Loose Duke it?"
Zac: Very specifically was told there aren't air ducts.
"Ally: Oh really? Oh, fuck, oh."
"Brennan: Well there are air ducts here, but it's about finding them connected. It's about finding the air ducts being connected in a way that's helpful for you, right?"
"E: Is it just crazy to just say you can wait it out? Wait for someone to come out, right?"
: But then I don't know if that means they'll wake up on the inside.
: You think there'd be multiple people.
": Yeah, right."
: There are a lot of people in there.
": You got a 24, right?"
Zac: Yeah.
: You do sense multiple sleeping people.
Z: Okay. So I'll just wait for a sec.
Brennan: Cool. That is absolutely the right move. We're going to roll a die. You want a high number here.
: Nat 20.
: 19!
: 17.
Lou: Woo!
"Brennan: So, you hide. Handy Annie just goes flush to the wall, straightens fingers out."
: And the slug is like on top?
"Brennan: Yeah, like on top. Just looks flush to the wall."
: Just random goo.
"Brennan: And it's a long wait. There is a very long wait. But like you say, there's this rush, rush, rush, rush. But you go, hold on. This could blow the whole fucking thing. Let's just be patient for a moment. It's a good 20 minutes. They come yell at you. Phil the guard says,"
Phil: Gnosis is here?
Margaret: I was having a dream.
: And standing up.
Phil: I have a dream too.
: Hm?
Phil: A dream about our Lord Zed.
: That's--
Gunnie: Praise Zed!
: Tell me everything about that. You should tell me everything about that.
: You see--
Lou: Can I see Big Barry from my cell?
"Brennan: You can see Big Barry, yeah."
": Hey, you wanna play rock, paper, scissors?"
: Let's put some money on it.
"The two play rock, paper, scissors for several rounds, continuously both throwing scissors."
"Brennan: Okay, we cut from this."
(laughing)
: 20 minutes.
: 20 minutes.
Zac: You guys are not allowed to play games.
(laughing)
Brennan: During that do we see Norman Takamori in his cell just.
Zac: Like the bolt is out of his brain now so that he remembers the champagne explosions.
"Brennan: Yeah, exactly. Just like with a soft recently surgery-ed head."
: Oh god.
Ally: Who's close to him?
"Brennan: Oh also, you've had a cerebro slug in your body that hasn't turned on pain receptors in like weeks. So you are just--"
: Ah!
(laughing)
"Brennan: Yeah, just like weird blisters and like chaffing and stuff. It's just like, oh this body hasn't been super been taken care of."
"Lou: Yeah, there's no moisturizing going on."
Siobhan: Oh chaffed skin.
"Margaret: Talk to me, Skipper."
Norman: Huh?
Margaret: What's going through your mind?
Norman: I don't know you that well.
"Margaret: Yeah, that's true, that's very true."
"Norman: Why am I in jail, it wasn't my fault."
Margaret: If you have any questions I'll help answer 'em. We know it wasn't your fault.
Norman: Where are we?
"Brennan: You guys see. So 20 minutes elapses. And sure enough, it's a shared sleeping area. Someone who is showering and getting ready for their shift walks out of the barracks, door opens."
: Can you see their butt?
"Brennan: Go ahead and give me another stealth check. This one you're gonna roll straight. Unless you have a way of getting advantage, but."
: I have expertise in stuff. Is that helpful at all?
": You could, if you wanted to, depart from Handy Annie here."
Emily: Do you have expertise?
Zac: Yeah.
Emily: You'd be better at than Handy Annie.
": Yeah, maybe I'll try that."
": Yeah, why not?"
"Brennan: Go for it. Okay, go ahead and give me a stealth check."
: Sheesh.
: Slither.
"Zac: Okay, so that is not a great roll. Sorry."
Emily: Okay.
Zac: But I get a. So that is a 14.
: And I check the passive perception of these guards.
: Of a sleeping guard?
": You can defiant, right?"
: I already used it.
: Okay.
: I already used it.
": I mean come on, it's just a little snot on the ground."
: Cool.
": Brennan, he's going like this. (squelching)"
": You move into the room. Handy Annie, you're outside, you're recording. One of the guards in the barracks turns around, steps right over Skip and out the door, it closes."
: Oh! Buddy! This is gonna be great for the reel.
Ally: Yeah.
": Skulk, skulk, skulking along. You cannot see or hear. You can only feel. You can sense the psychic warmth get closer and closer. Like a distant candle in the darkness of night that grows larger and larger as you approach the mind of a sleeping creature. (squelching) Grows closer. You feel your body uncomfortably drying out as you realize you are probably moving up some kind of cloth. Sapping the moisture from you. A blanket closer, you touch something very warm. A neck. (squelching)"
: Are you doing little kisses as you go? (laughing)
": Skip, you find a warm and welcoming nose. (groaning)"
Ally: Fuck that up.
": Your character pitch, you did this, not me! Incredible. And you feel yourself entering, gah, a brain."
: Is it contested intelligence check?
": Yeah, so go ahead and read the power to me."
": So it's body thief. There's a lot going on here, but as far as actually taking over a body it says."
Brennan: Cool.
": The cerebro slug initiates an intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within five feet of it. If it wins the contest the cerebro slug burrows into the target's brain, and takes control of the target's body. While inside I have total cover against attacks and other effects ranging from outside of the host. Cerebro slug retains its intelligence, wisdom, charisma scores, as well as its telepathy and its traits."
: Incredible.
: I otherwise adopt the target's statistics.
: Amazing. Contested intelligence. Rolling it from the board.
: Should I throw it up in the air?
": Oh actually, this is definitely Box of Doom. What am I doing?"
All: Yeah!
": Okay, Box of Doom."
": Also, one point of business. I casted like sage advice for everyone and I was supposed to pick a thing and I think I would have picked persuasion as my--"
": Cool, so everyone has that plus to persuasion right now, amazing."
": Great, okay."
: Okay.
: Do I throw it in there?
": I'll let you know what you're trying to beat. You're trying to beat a... That's a 14 on the die, minus one, for 13."
": All right, okay."
: You need to beat a 13 contested intelligence.
: I have a plus four to intelligence.
": Okay, so nine or higher."
: Nine or higher.
Zac: Come on.
All: Come on.
": Let's go, doctor."
Brennan: 13.
: Yes!
: Woo!
": Okay, okay!"
"Brennan: Hell yes, incredible. In the sleeping body of this prison officer, you feel once again, light. You attach to a brain stem and a very familiar body comes online for you."
: Very familiar?
: Same species.
": Oh. So I'm feeling like a little more used to it, a little less like I came from the cold depths of space."
": Correct, yes."
": Do I make a piloting check, or?"
: Give me a piloting check.
: 15.
: You awaken.
Lou: My man is up.
": Guy turns around. So this body is coming online way faster than Skipper's did but it's still brand new, right?"
: Okay.
": So I see another guy is also getting up over in the corner, turns around and says, hey there, Slim. How's it going, man? Another day, another dollar, am I right?"
: Right on.
": Right on, man, right on. Hey, you were knocking 'em back last night, man. It was good, you know. I gotta say, I've never seen you play darts like that. The spirit moved ya, I guess. Ha, ha, ha."
: Fill 'er up.
": Right on, right on, brother. I dig it, man. I'm always really excited to come to work with you. It's really nice. I feel close."
: Kiss him. (laughing)
": Slap him, kiss him."
: Kiss him and slap him.
": Yeah, a good handshake between friends."
"Emily: Kiss him, I think something happened last night."
": Wow, oh, feeling my arms. They're great, great, great, great."
Ally: Kiss him!
": Well, another day, another dollar. Back to work. (laughing) You see. Amazing. Cool, you're in his body."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: What happens next?
Zac: I'm looking around and I'm seeing a room.
: Yes.
": I'm, yeah getting out from under my covers and ready to work. I want to sort of just take a step out into that main area that I just came from."
: Put Handy Annie in your pocket.
": Yeah, I'd just like to make a, yeah, just another perception check as I go into that room."
": Cool, give me a perception check."
: That is gonna be a 16.
": Hell yes. Okay, so 16. You see everything you can see in that room. There is a kind of comms, a larger comms station here in this room than in the chamber past it. This sort of chamber is a little bit more of a security station, whereas this middle desk here has paper work and there's clearly like closets and sleeping areas. You can see they're working on some consoles here or computers. It looks like there might be some other cellblocks nearby. You're sort of in one block of cells in this space, right."
: I wanna look for two things.
: Yes.
: First I wanna look for if there is anywhere nearby where people's stuff would be.
": You see a couple doors that seem probable. I'll do a little luck check right now to see if any of them are open as you step out. I rolled a 19. Immediately across from you, you see that there is a storage area right across from you that is open. And there are other doors that might have stuff in them as well."
Emily: Oh shit.
Ally: There are some lockers in that room with the beds too.
": Yeah, you see there's like an armory. There's like blaster rifles upon the wall in the bedroom that you're in, right? So there's like some standard issue stuff. That place with the closets across from you, they have locks on them, but that does look like a locker. It looks like some kind of vault across from you."
: I wanna see if I can like remember in the mind of this guard.
": Yeah, give me another piloting check."
": That's better, 22."
": You remember a door code to open that vault area, but not the vaults themselves. The vaults themselves need a supervisor's keycard."
": Okay, I'm gonna look around and. So, would I use this guy's stats for like a sleight of hand thing?"
": Yes, you would."
": Okay, how am I feeling?"
": By the way, did you grab Handy Annie?"
: Not yet.
": Okay, whenever you do, she can give you help actions."
": Okay, yeah, I'll look for Handy Annie and grab Handy Annie if that's fine."
": Yeah, you step next to Handy Annie and Handy Annie crawls up the pant leg. Yup."
": So, in this order. Well, I wanna lean over to where this supervisor is and say, hey, uh, sorry about how fucked up I got last night. And slap him on the shoulder and try to do a little sleight of hand to grab the keycard."
": Okay, give me. First thing is give me a persuasion roll."
: Okay.
": I mean, you're gonna krill this."
: And I can add krill to this? What's that persuasion?
": Oh yeah, plus you just get your proficiency added to this."
: Okay.
": Krill this dude, krill this."
: Fuck.
: Krill it.
": I'm krillin' it. Oh, a 17 plus three."
": Krilled, dude."
: Dirty 20.
": So you see the supervisor looks at you and goes. I'm really happy to hear you say that, man. (chuckling) It's uh, you know, we're all worried about you, man. You know?"
: Right.
": Because this is a hard job and you know... we all know that things with Sara didn't go as planned. Marriages are hard under the best of circumstances and you gotta contract on a space station way out here in the boonies and. (groaning) (laughing) You see, he just embraces you and starts crying. You're in the open air of the place. This is the first step, man. Okay, this is absolutely the first step, okay? And I'm here for you. If you need anything, okay?"
: Right on.
": While this hug is happening, can Handy Annie try to pilfer something else off of this dude?"
": Yeah, give me a sleight of hand check."
: Would that also be a plus six?
": Yes, that also would be a plus six."
Emily: 11.
: I'm gonna need a stealth check from Handy Annie.
": Uh, 10."
": Okay, you see Handy Annie sort of crawls into this guy's pocket. And you see he goes, what the hell? And grabs Handy Annie."
": Wait, what is that? What is that?"
": You see he says, is this yours?"
: Why would that be mine? (laughing) You just pulled it out of your pocket. What's wrong with him?
: Give me a deception.
Ally: Oh my god!
Brennan: Give me a deception.
": Yeah, probably not. Oh, nat 20! (laughing)"
": You see he says, it's not mine! And you see a dude behind him takes the butt of his rifle and clocks him over the back of the head. And says, he's got the android's hand! He's helping them! And these dudes just."
: I grab and pretend to fight the Handy Annie.
: They just start wailing on this dude. Get him! He's helping the prisoners!
: Can I sleight of hand grab the keycard?
": Do it with advantage, given the distraction of everything going on."
": 19 on the dot, plus 11, so 30."
": Yeah, you grab the authority card. They're like, we knew you were working with them the whole time! And they drag him off."
": Oh, this sweet man. He was just trying to help his employees."
: And I'm gonna look for the button to release prisoners.
": Give me an investigation check. You also have Handy Annie again. But in the chaos, people are gonna look for this hand. I'm gonna say that in two rounds, people are going to start looking for this hand, cool?"
": Okay, I am going to in that case, can I sleight of hand hiding Handy Annie on me?"
: Give me sleight of hand. And Handy Annie can help you with this as well.
": Cool, that is going to be a 19."
: Okay.
": And then I'm gonna look for that button with a perception, investigation?"
": Investigation, yup."
": Okay, cool."
: And you're doing this with your proficiency but this person's stats. So you might add a little bit less to it.
": Oh, but I keep my intelligence and stuff."
": Oh great, in that case, yeah, you're good to go. Yeah, yeah, go for it."
: I have a plus seven to this with Handy Annie's help.
Brennan: Mm-hm.
: So that's a 12.
": Okay, you're looking at the console and having a hard time remembering. There's not a big button labeled like, release all prisoners. It's in fact, you think, probably there's a sequence that needs to get punched in."
": Hm, hm, okay."
": So, getting the door open and the equipment out is gonna be way easier."
: Okay.
": But there's maybe a harder. Like, you either need to do like a hacker's kit check. You didn't find the thing you were looking for. So it's either a hacker's kit check or some other way of getting those cells all opened."
: Can I intermediary either Gunnie or Sid into the brain of Skip and have them look?
": Yeah, because we both have proficiency with hacker's kits."
": With your disadvantage still, give me an insight check."
": Oof, two twos. That's a 13."
": 13, okay. Here's what we're gonna need to do then. You can create that channel, but we're gonna need Skip to hit a, basically like a sleight of hand check and either Sid or Gunnie are gonna have to hit a disadvantage on whatever mechanic or hacker thing they're doing."
: Got it.
: Cool?
: Yeah.
": Okay, so this is a DC 15 sleight of hand right here."
: With advantage from Handy Annie?
": Sure, in this case you can get advantage, yes."
: I'm trying to hit what?
: 15.
": Nine plus seven, so 16."
": Okay you hit it, so you form the connection, Riva. And so we're asking for a hacking check from."
": Hacking should be Sid, right? Because Sid has, or do you have?"
: I have expertise in both.
": Oh great, then Gunnie."
": Okay, so Gunnie you hear. Riva, what is Gunnie hearing in his mind as you're there?"
: Gunnie there's a computer thing.
: Uh-huh.
": There's a thing with computers. I don't, just look at the thing. I don't know. There's a button."
": Uh, yeah."
: So like the operative and the engineer are having like a complex discussion only through what this completely high psychic can communicate.
: With a minus one to intelligence.
": Okay, a lot of this is purple, and it's not normally purple, but okay, yes."
: These buttons might be red and I don't know.
: What are the buttons?
": Okay, yeah, all right, here we go."
": Okay, it's disadvantage. You need to hit a DC 20 to find this."
": Oh, what do you have?"
: I get plus 11 to both of these.
: Both of them have to be over nine.
Brennan: Nine or over on both.
: First one is six.
": So, no."
: Second one is 10. If I defiant.
: On a three or a four you'll get that six to where it needs to be.
": Big money, big money."
"Ally: Big money, big money."
: Kiss the die!
": I missed. I'm nervous! Okay, I'm gonna go again."
Ally: The metal one?
": Yeah, the metal."
"Siobhan: All right, no."
": That was your mistake! The metal, don't do the metal dice! They don't play."
: That's a one.
: Okay.
": What is that, 18?"
: It's an 18.
: All right.
: Cool.
": I'm sorry, it's just. The color is a big part of it for me."
": Okay, I will allow you to attempt that again. You have one more round before they come looking for that hand. You can have that again, it's just now it's deception because you're fucking around on a computer doing complicated stuff in front of everybody. So, give me a deception check. For this next round, the deception is only, we'll call it a DC 12 in this first round. It's gonna get higher."
": And is Handy Annie helping me, or?"
: I don't think Handy Annie can help with this roll.
": Got it, okay. Do I add, still add that plus three?"
: That's persuasion.
": Oh, geez yeah. No, I didn't get it."
": Okay, you see that one of the guards next to you goes, Slim, what's up, man? What do you need help with?"
: I'm fucked up.
": Are you fucked up at work, man?"
": I'm fucked up. I'm fucked up, man. (laughing)"
: You're fucked up at work?
: I'm fucked up.
": Okay, you have one more shot to make this. To make this. Just the deep sadness of this guard's life. Totally incidental to all. You're just trying to get out of this."
": Poor man, can we take him with us?"
": Yeah, let's take him with us."
": I feel like he would be a great crewman, honestly. He just needs a chance."
"Brennan: He just needs a chance, okay."
": Although he's got a really good support system, so. (laughing)"
Brennan: Very supportive coworkers.
: They turned on their other friend so fast.
": Yeah, it's a vicious. There's a lot, it's a high bar. Okay, so that's gonna be, you get one more. Again, you need to hit the You can do this with advantage."
: Okay.
": Yes, for sure."
": Okay, amazing. DC 20 rolling with disadvantage."
": Here we go, one at a time, one at a time."
": One at a time, one at a time. The first one's a 15."
Ally: Okay.
Brennan: Here's the next one.
": Easy, easy. It's easy."
Murph: No.
Siobhan: No.
: No.
Emily: Is it a crit and you're being hammy?
Lou: It's a six again.
": Okay, okay, that's fine."
"Ally: Oh, I could train my critical analysis on him."
": Okay. Yeah, absolutely."
Ally: You add my intelligence modifier to one attack ability check or saving throw.
: This is an ability check.
: You add plus five.
L: That's 11.
: Woo!
: That is 11.
: Plus 11 is 22.
"Brennan: Woo! Okay. So you're sitting there talking. So Margaret, in the middle of this thing, like you can hear Gunnie sort of like muttering because he's talking in his head. But if you like join the channel with Riva. So it's like, Margaret and Gunnie are both trying to get Riva to communicate really hard computer programming stuff to Skip on the other side of this prison block."
: I'm fucked up.
: What is he talking about? What is he talking about?
: Press the square button. The other square button! I don't know!
(laughing)
: It's a keyboard.
Brennan: It's a keyboard!
: You're so smart.
": I know, I'm fucked up, though."
": No, you with the person are not actually fucked up."
"Brennan: All right, on a 22. Every single cell block opens. (imitating electronic beeping) Cells open."
Siobhan: So I am still in my orb?
Brennan: So you are in--
Siobhan: Is that orb transportable? Or am I in a different orb than the one that they were transporting me in?
"Brennan: I'm gonna say that, let me actually check with our TaleSpire crew real quick."
Siobhan: If not.
Brennan: Mm-hm?
Siobhan: The aqualung breathers that I got for everybody.
Brennan: Yeah?
"Siobhan: The language of it is, it says you can breathe in either air or water."
": Or water, correct."
"Siobhan: So, if we can get our stuff."
: You can walk.
Siobhan: I can breathe.
"Brennan: You can breathe. Your gills will have it. Yes, so that bulb is not moveable. So, you're gonna have to hit air. Either hit air or assume that your psycho-drone is nearby and that someone can bring it to you. But you're also messed up. You need to get out of it."
"Siobhan: I mean, even then I need to get my body out there somewhere. I can't leave my body on this prison ship."
"Brennan: For sure, absolutely. All right, so all of those released I'm gonna need immediately an a DC 20 intelligence saving throw from Skip."
Zac: 20?
Brennan: Yes.
Zac: Intelligence saving throw. It's a 19.
"Brennan: One away. Hold on, gang."
: What happens? What happens?
Emily: Handy Annie does have a fly speed.
Zac: Okay.
Emily: So if you get ejected from this body she can just fly up.
"Brennan: Something comes on. You open the cellblocks. Wha, wha, wha, wha. Big alarm begins to sound over the prison. Everybody, roll initiative."
: Ah!
": Oh god. Oh, okay, nine."
": I guess I don't know what this guy's dex is, or."
: I can...
": Barry, you look so small."
": Yeah, Barry you without your clothes is..."
"Brennan: Oh, dex is plus three."
: Everyone relax.
"Zac: I got a nine, then."
": Okay, we're gonna go around and I want everyone here to give me your initiative. So Gunnie?"
: 17.
: Gunnie is 17. Riva?
: 11.
: Skip?
: Nine.
: Margaret?
: 12.
: Nine.
: Also 11.
: We are clustered.
": I got this, guys."
": Gunnie, it's all down to you."
": Me, no weapons, just sprinting."
": The door is open, but I continue to be drugged."
: Yes.
": The alarms go off. There are guards everywhere. All the cell doors open. Gunnie, you are first to act."
": Okay, Gunnie's gonna peak his head out. I see that there don't seem to be any guards other than Phil who's talking to Riva in the hallway."
Brennan: There are more around Sid's door.
Emily: Don't worry about me.
": You got it. Can I make a perception check for anything, for any sort of thing that might be connected to the alarm system in this space?"
": I think you can tell that there are some control panel areas. Probably within movement of wherever you are. So for example, near this area here there are some controls here. Now obviously, nothing is gonna have the ease of like a grid, like at the master control station. But there are interfaces to work with the security system."
": I would love to go, I wanna try and turn off the alarm."
": Awesome, let's do it. All right, Gunnie you rush out of your door over to this comm station right here. That's definitely within movement for you to be able to get there. As you do so, so Gunnie shoots over here. What, so there's two ways you could try to go after this."
: Okay.
": There is a, and I think they're probably the same roll for you. So it's basically just whatever Gunnie would attempt to do."
: Yeah.
": You can go hacker's kit to try to go into the code, or try to deal with the computer in some way. This is not setup for you to be able to do that. So that would be with disadvantage to try and make a hacking check here, right?"
: Okay.
": It's not setup to do that, but if you did it, it would make this seem like a weird, momentary blip or something, right? The other way of doing it would be to just do a security kit check. Which means that you are going in just to jam it and shut it down. There would still, in other words, it would be getting rid of just the lights and the noise. So that alarm signal would still be in the computer somewhere. It would just be that the human beings here in the block would see it go away."
": Okay, I'm leaning toward the latter. I just had a crazy idea, and I wanna run it by you. Is there any way I can get the VO to come on and suggest that there's been some sort of airlock breach and everyone needs to evacuate immediately?"
: Okay.
: Can I tap into that alert or thing?
": Here's the deal. There is a very simple, low DC security check for you to tap into the comms system. Because these guards need to be able to communicate with each other up and down the line. So that is a functionality that this system absolutely has. It's just a deception check."
: I'll go for those.
": Cool, give me--"
: What about a persuasion?
: What about a persuasion check?
": What about a persuasion? For your lives, please evacuate."
": If you blow a hole in the side of the station, it would mean there'd be an airlock breach and then it would be persuasion. But as of right now it is deception."
: So what do you need first?
": What I need first is we're gonna do a low DC, call it a DC"
: So it's not a four.
: Oh no.
: Come on.
: It's a three.
: No!
: Oh no.
: Defiant. I can use it if I can see you.
": Okay, I will say in that case, you can use it. Go for it."
: So we just need a one.
Brennan: You just need a one. You make the check.
": Great, I got a one. I'm embarrassed. I'm very embarrassed."
Ally: That sucked.
": He's not used to not having his data pad on him. I just, I don't feel like myself, but we're getting it."
": Okay, now comes the deception check. I'm gonna say that all the alarms going off normally mean bad things with the prisoners, however, it is very plausible, no one's had an airlock breach here before, but it's plausible. So this is neither advantage or disadvantage. You're just rolling a straight deception check."
: Great.
Ally: Okay. Which dice are you using?
": You have good charisma, too."
: I have a plus three to this.
": That's not a metal dice, right?"
: This is not a metal dice. This is the dice you gave me earlier today.
": Oh, cute."
: Oh no. It's an eight.
: Plus what?
: That's a five plus three for eight.
": Does he still have your critical analysis, or what?"
Lou: It's deception.
Zac: Just once?
: Yeah.
": It's just once, yup. And it would have been on..."
Brennan: Intelligence.
": Yeah, I would just be adding a five to that."
": Okay, okay."
": Gunnie, you've gotta admit your dice."
"Lou: I, hey."
: You gotta see who's rolling hot. You gotta see who's looking to play.
": I mean, I wasn't showing up."
": Okay, so you rolled an eight."
": Wait, that was?"
: That was deception.
": That was the first one this, okay."
: I'm gonna roll. This is an opposed roll. It's insight versus deception.
: What do they get?
": Minus three, is what I actually--"
": You know what, you'll know right away whether it works or not. So I'll let you know right now. They get a plus two. So if they get a five or lower."
"Lou: Please, please. It was a good idea."
: It was a good idea.
": Please. Please, dice! Please!"
: That's a 16.
": God damn it, that was like really good success. (laughing)"
: Not even for a second.
": Cool, any bonus actions from Gunnie?"
": Uh, I look over at Big Barry and I say, hey, kick some ass. And I'm gonna give you a potent aptitude."
: Yes!
: So you have a D6 to use as need be. That's one of my bonus actions.
: Woo!
": With my other bonus action, which I now have."
": Sid and Barry. You in that jump suit, you look..."
: Gosh.
: The jumpsuit is so big for you.
"Emily: Yeah, it looks baggy, so baggy."
: Are you blue?
: You look like you've been famous for a decade. (laughing)
: I think I'm gonna call it there.
: Cool.
: And then...
": So you get on, what do you say over the comm system?"
": I just like, there's been a breach of airlock. Get the hell outta here or you're gonna die with the rest of 'em. Everyone's allowed to leave. It's every man for himself!"
": I think the guards hear, everyone's allowed to leave."
Ally: Everyone's allowed to leave.
": Gunnie, do you wanna get in my cell?"
": Yeah, let me run down to Barry's cell. Ah! And then yeah, I'll dip into Big Barry's cell."
": Incredible, hold on. Let me just see here. Okay, that's 23. Yeah, you can go another 10 feet to get towards Barry's cell."
": Oh. And then can I. Riva, can you link me with Skip? Not, actually Norman, the real man."
"Siobhan: Skip, though."
Emily: The real Skip.
"Lou: Yes, the real Skipper."
": Yes, I can but he's not gonna be happy. He's gonna be so mean to me. Yes, I can do it. Let me, like I have to roll insight again?"
": Yeah, give me an insight again."
": Oi, it's a 10."
": I mean, he's right there, right?"
": Yeah, you can see him. You link up with, it's very muffled."
": Hey, Norman."
: What?
": This is that idiot, Gunnie."
": Yeah, I know."
": Hey, there's been a big old breach in the airlock. We gotta get outta here. (laughing)"
Emily: Everyone is allowed to leave!
": So just stick with us, okay?"
: No!
": We fucked up, it's our fault. It's 10033611760ur fault."
: You idiots.
": Yeah, I know."
: Everyone is out to get me killed.
": No, we're trying to save your life, idiot. You're the idiot."
": No, you're the idiot."
: You're the idiot.
": All right, that is Gunnie's turn. You begin to sprint away from there. Ugh, the dice, what are you gonna do?"
: The dice.
: Our various prisoners are all going to sprint out of their cells down the hall. Estrea and Jasmine are each gonna go 90 feet. Shawna's gonna go 60 and then Kilogram and--
: Mother fuckers.
: Who are these names?
: And Krang are gonna go 60 feet.
: Will you please just give me a quick snippet of your life story?
": We are smugglers, so hello. Bye-bye!"
: I throw 'em a business card.
": I take, thank you for this. And heads off."
": Miss Margaret, I think I made a good new connection."
: Incredible.
: Where the bloody hell are those bloody girl guides?
": You see the alien looks and says, oh, nice to network with ya, thanks. And sprints off down the hall."
: What no business card in return?
": You see he goes, wha-ka, and three business cards thud into the wall behind you."
: Ah!
": Cool. Margaret, it's gonna be your turn."
": Okay, I come out of my cell. I just run and then I say, what's your guy's names? Jasmine and Estrea? What are you guys getting up to? I just kinda wanna run with them. Are you related, what's the deal?"
": You see that they're sprinting. They're like, you see that the younger of the two, Jasmine, looks and says, yeah, yeah, we're related."
": Oh, that's so cool. What are you in here for?"
": Um, parking ticket."
: I don't believe that for a second.
": Hey, hey, I don't know you!"
: I don't believe that for a second.
": I don't know you, though!"
: I understand.
: What's your deal? (heavy panting)
": So yeah, we're just like catching up and chatting."
": Amazing, okay. So you are gonna be able to move I think, because you've used, that's an action to use that. Force of personality, right?"
": Yeah, it was."
": So you moved 30 feet. Margaret after your turn, Riva and Barry act on the same initiative. Any bonus actions from you, Margaret, or are you all good?"
": Um, I will use my bonus action and put my critical analysis on Gunnie. Can I see him?"
"Brennan: Yeah, you can do that."
Lou: Thank you. [Brennan] Cool cool.
": I think, I do have my gun. So if you hold your turn I might be able to shoot you out."
: But I won't be able to breathe.
: Yeah.
: We don't have our gear.
: But can I maybe be like be. (blowing)
"Brennan: Actually, I will say this right now. I will say this, Riva, uh, Riva you will be able to hold. You can effectively hold your breath similar to like drowning rules. And also, once you're out of that drugged water, you, well, I don't know, yeah. But the point being, it is possible for you to like, hold your breath, effectively."
": Okay, great, yeah. Then I'll hold my turn until."
": Yeah, unless someone else has another plan."
: Does this glass seem like it's shootable?
: It looks pretty bullet proof. A lot of the stuff in here is pretty bullet proof.
"Emily: Oh, okay. So maybe that's not an option."
: Is there a way to get me out of here?
": Yeah, there's a console next to it."
Siobhan: Is there a button?
": Yeah, there's--"
": I was doing stuff on the console that wasn't related to you, but I could do stuff."
": Okay, so nevermind then. Maybe, well."
: You can send your turn down the order if you want to like hold off.
": Maybe Gunnie can, I mean maybe Barry can do it, though."
": Yeah, I think I'm gonna beat up some guards."
: I mean.
: I'm gonna long shot it.
Brennan: Cool.
": Phil. I'm very interested in dangling Zed and everything that he can do for me. And if you let me out of here, I promise to faithfully study, genuinely look into it."
: Give me persuasion.
": Great, with plus how many?"
": 10\. I'm sorry, just your proficiency bonus."
": I think it's more than that, because you've got sage advice, right?"
: This is...
": It's your modifier, right? Plus 5?"
": Yeah, the first time that I use it."
": It's your intelligence modifier and your proficiency, so I think it's a plus eight."
": Yes, you're right."
": Great, so I have a plus 16 to this roll."
Ally: Incredible.
: And I did roll a nat one. Murph: Oh my god.
Ally: Oh my god.
Emily: Oh my god! (sighing)
": He looks at you, and you see, he says, now's a good a time as any to learn."
": Subtle control, I wipe his memory of that happening."
: Okay.
: Completely.
: Incredible.
": Oh, he has to do a wisdom saving throw to do that. It's a DC 16."
": Okay, I think maybe I have a way I can try and help you."
": Okay, so you do take your turn. He fails the wisdom saving throw and forgets that and says, sorry, what were you saying?"
: What?
": What? Okay, that is your turn. Barry, that's you."
": Sweet, I.. bah, bah, bah. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and I can't, can I have bo- Can I have gone into the zone before combat?"
: No.
": Okay, cool. Then I'm just going to jump out. I use my movement to, I use 20 feet of my movement to get out into the hallway here. Do bonus action 30 foot jump in the middle of those dudes."
Brennan: Cool.
: And do five damage to all of 'em. And then I'm gonna just gonna start hitting 'em with my fists.
": Hell yeah. All right, so immediate five damage to all three of the guards right in this area as Barry leaps out of there. So you're not in the zone. You're using your bonus action to... Murph: Yep."
": Cool, cool. Hell yeah, you have action left, go ahead and make your attacks."
": Sweet. Oh, baby. That's a, yeah, natural 19, so 27."
: That's gonna hit.
": Aw sweet. I'll just do all my attacks at once. So I'm gonna do, so my fists are D6 weapons. So I'm gonna do two attacks and then an off hand. Oh wait, I can't do an off hand attack, that's a bonus action."
Brennan: Cool.
": Another 19, two 19s."
: Hell yeah! There it is.
"Brennan: All right, you hit twice, baby."
": Yeah, dude."
Siobhan: Save some of those rolls for the rest of us
Lou: Let me get some of those rolls.
": All right, so here's damage on the first attack."
": Okay, so damage on the first attack. Seven damage."
: Seven damage. Murph: So 12 total.
": 12 total, okay. Still not down."
: 10 damage on the second attack.
": Damn, Barry."
": So, Barry, you rush out of your cell. Rah! Leap forward. Bam! Hit the deck. All of the guards fly up about four feet off the ground. You grab one of them. Do you wanna spread your attacks out to two different people or do them both on one?"
: I think do them to one dude.
": All right. And you grab the one that's right next to you and as you're coming down, slam him, like, full King Kong. Just boom, boom! Like ragdoll body, guy is toast. Other two still badly, still have taken five points of damage each."
: Sweet.
": That is going to, that's your action and bonus action. Now we're gonna move down. Sid and Skip, you're acting on the same initiative."
: Do you have an opinion on if you wanna go or what?
: I was gonna spend my turn trying to get the stuff and try to get to you guys.
": Yeah, that sounds awesome. Let's do that and see how far you get."
: Okay.
": Cool. I'll tell you right now, like the amount of equipment you guys are talking about is a staggering amount of equipment."
": Oh god, yeah."
: So like carrying all of it may prove to be quite difficult.
: I wanna get...
": I mean if you can even get a couple of guns and Gunnie and Sid's focuses, Like that's huge"
": Yeah, I'm gonna prioritize their focuses and like."
: Cool.
: A couple of guns. I wanna put on my jet pack too.
": Hell yeah, great, great, great. Okay, so first off. You're just gonna walk, keycard immediately opens the door. So you take 30 feet of movement from the station and 30 feet is gonna get you all the way. So in just one movement, you swipe the keycard, that's your object interaction. You now have a bonus action and an action standing in front of these vaults here."
: Okay. What kind of check do I need to make for that?
": Oh wait, no, I said the keycard was for the vaults."
": Yeah, you just remembered the codes."
": So you punch in, you remembered the code. You have the keycard. You can swipe those vaults open right now."
": Okay, great."
: So.
: Is that an object interaction or?
": Already used yours to get to the door. So you're gonna have to use either, you're either gonna have to choose your bonus action or your action to open the vaults up."
": I'll do bonus, yeah either way, it's fine. Take your pick."
": Cool, grab that. Give me an investigate check as you're rummaging through these vaults."
": Okay, can Handy Annie help with this?"
": Yes, she can."
: Oo.
": 19 and a natural one, so thank goodness."
: Woo!
": Investigation, sorry, would be 23."
": Okay, I'm gonna say for each five point above 10 you grab something. Gunnie's gadgeteer harness you grab and Sid's wrist pad you grab. Tech focus."
: Yeah!
: And that's all I could get on that one?
": On that roll, that's all you can. You see all the other stuff, but this is what you're like shoveling in unto your person to be able to carry."
": Okay, I'll grab those and maybe try to throw on a jet pack with the bonus action."
": Yeah, if you wanna do that, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me, we have bonus action, or use the bonus action to open the vaults up because they were closed and sealed."
": Oh okay, object interaction, bonus action, action, done."
": Done, yes."
: Okay.
: So you have the focuses and you've used your movement. So that's the end of your turn as you're grabbing that stuff.
"Zac: Okay, did not get to go very far."
"Brennan: That's going to move, that's gonna be Sid."
": Okay, as my bonus action I will activate my ideal of the agile. So opportunity attacks have disadvantage against me."
: Cool.
: And then I'm just gonna shoot the people in front of me.
": Cool, you move out into the hall. They're both badly injured by Barry. Go ahead and take some attacks."
": Okay, my first one I get to roll advantage. Does a 15 hit?"
: You know it does.
": 15 hits, that's correct."
": Yeah! All right, that is 12 damage."
: Down.
: Gonna spend a tech point to add to my speed. That's a five. So now my speed for this turn is 50.
Ally: Nice.
Brennan: Woo!
: And then my second I'm gonna just take my second attack.
Brennan: Go for it.
: Does a 11 hit?
: 11 does not hit.
": Oh, targeted strike. I can use my reaction to roll a superiority die, D6 that adds to the attack roll and then the damage roll if it hits."
: Go for it.
: So it's an 11?
": Yeah, yeah."
: 11.
: Come on.
: Two. 13?
": 13 doesn't do it. (groaning) So good, so good you remember, but there it is. Okay, one guard left."
": Okay, and then I have these 50 feet of movement. Let me see, does 50 feet get me to, I guess Riva doesn't need me. You know what? I'm gonna use my movement to run down this hall and get some cover from these guards."
: Okay.
: Knowing that I'll still be attacking them.
": So yeah, it takes 20 feet to get where you are right here. And then another 50 will get ya, pretty much around the corner."
: Yeah.
": Great, so Sid's gonna move around the corner and is now in the lead, roller skating fast as lightning."
: I'm assuming you can be the damage sponge and then I can just.
": Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
: Attack of opportunity with disadvantage as you move past that guard.
: Like Apollo Ohno going around the corner.
Emily: I only have 16 right now.
: Only have 16 right now. That is gonna be a hit. So that's gonna be.
": I have temporary hit points, so."
": You take nine points of damage as this crackling ionic baton. (buzzing) Wait, do you take double damage from ion stuff or no?"
": I don't think so, because I'm a wren."
": Oh yeah, that makes sense."
: That's my background.
": Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're good, you're good. So yeah, lightning baton deals nine points of damage to you. And you are scooting down the hall. Bad guys are gonna go."
": Praise Zed, Phil. Praise Zed."
: Can I say I closed the door behind me when I went in there?
"Brennan: Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah."
": Because it needs a keycard to open, right?"
Brennan: Yep.
: The die was like...
: All the juice.
": This is embarrassing for you, don't do this."
Brennan: Barry?
": Yeah, a good question. Would Norman have gone on my turn as well?"
": Uh yeah, I think so. Probably just like sprinting down the hall?"
": Yeah, I guess so."
: After all of the yelling we did at him.
": Yeah, yeah, I think he's just sprinting down the hall. So we can move Norman a full 60, or actually a full 90 down the hall."
"Zac: Oh my god, yes."
"Brennan: Bonus action dash, yeah."
"Zac: Perfect, perfect."
": Norm's gonna move 90 feet down the hall. Four damage as one of the prison guards cracks you with the ion thing here. This guard over here. Bah, bah, bah."
: I've been saying praise Zed a lot.
Brennan: You have been saying praise Zed a lot.
": I'm clearly a follower. He wouldn't you know, turn the other cheek and all. Yup, that's right, that's right. That's the measurement you wanna make."
"Brennan: Exactly. This dude's gonna take double move and flank Barry. Cool, TaleSpire crew, they stop beating the crap out of this other, out of their captain. They are going to seal this blast door here."
Ally: Ugh.
": That closes, ka-chunk. And are going to all take cover and ready actions behind the, behind this over here. So, they're gonna be behind the desk with weapons readied in cover. So in all of our little side bunk areas here. They're gonna be like, escape, there's an escape! That is going to be their turn. And we're gonna go back to Gunnie at the top of initiative."
: I'm gonna realize Big Barry is now doing violent things and turn back around and run back to the console from which I came and try and get Riva out.
Siobhan: Thank you.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go ahead and give me a security kit check."
": Come on, come on, come on."
Emily: Ugh.
: That's a 23.
": Hey, amazing."
: Better than anything else we've had today.
": Okay, Gunnie, you hit and you see that the bulb swivels and an opening tilted up, opens as the water recedes. There is just a open port in the bulb with a little bit of air going down to the surface of this like drugged water. And there's Riva inside."
": Riva are you gonna climb out? Is that, are you good with that? (gasping) Okay, it's clearly not good, but... You just, you give a holler if you need any help. I'm gonna hit you with a potent aptitude."
": Oh, thank you."
: Just to have.
: Just to have!
: And Gunnie's gonna run. I'm gonna use my full movement.
": Riva, is anyone going to? Will you be able to?"
: I have a movement of 10 outside water.
": So I think, Gunnie, if you're not able. If someone's not able to carry Riva, Riva's gonna be bringing up the rear."
: I can actually misty step over to Barry.
"Brennan: Oh, incredible. Cool."
Lou: In that case--
"Ally: You just appear around Barry's neck, great, ah!"
": While I'm still on this console, can I, is there anything I can do to fight the actions of the people down at other terminals?"
": Yes. So you've used an action there. With a bonus action, I will let you take a disadvantage hacking check to try to mess with one mechanical element of the prison."
: I'll take that.
Brennan: Cool.
: I'll take those odds. Thank you.
: Woo!
: Nice.
: Yes!
": Okay, 26 is enough for you to fuck with one mechanical element of the prison from where you are as you're getting Riva."
: They can't close that blast door.
": You guys, so you're in the other room and you hear, close the blast door! And you just hear, that console, you hit the button and just go see something. Da, da, da, da. And you just set. You log into a control panel and hit something and that blast door, blah. It's like an elevator door that scarily doesn't. It looks like it's about to close and then recedes and about to close and then recedes. That door is jammed."
": Uh-uh-ah. (laughing) I'm gonna take, I'll take my movement. I'll 30 feet down the hallway."
: Cool. Gunnie grabs Riva in his--
: Riva's gonna misty step.
Siobhan: I did misty step.
": Cool, cool, cool, amazing. So Gunnie, you take off 30 feet. That's gonna be the prisoners. Shawna, the two smugglers, and the Martinez siblings are gonna continue to sprint down the hallway. Characters they were made, and they, you know, they have personalities. There's stuff going on, but what are you gonna do?"
Siobhan: I will see 'em again.
": I definitely, I flip them all business cards."
: You see--
: The Wurst business cards with Sundry Sidney on 'em.
: Incredible.
: And a small headshot.
Brennan: I love it.
: Just a small one.
: Like a real estate agent.
": It's you in front of a brick wall, like. Wearing glasses we've never seen before."
": Margaret, it's gonna be you."
": Full dash action, please."
": Cool, Margaret's gonna go"
Ally: I train my critical analysis unto Riva.
": Amazing, so you've got potent aptitude now and critical analysis? Great. Riva, that's gonna be your turn."
": Okay, I'm gonna phase walk over to Gunnie."
"Brennan: Or phase walk over to Barry, or no?"
": To Barry, sorry."
: Cool.
": And then I say to Barry, Barry, would you prefer a weapon or one of these guys knocked to the floor?"
": Oo, knocked to the floor, please."
": Great, I will psychic shunt. It's a cantrip."
Brennan: Mm-hm.
: It's a strength saving throw and I will heighten spell to make them have that with disadvantage.
: That is a failure.
Ally: Woo!
: And they also take a small amount of damage that I will roll here. Oh. Three damage.
": Boom! That guy hits the deck. Yeah, Riva, you come out of this drugged water, pull yourself up into the air. Which again, feels clawing on your skin but you take a big, deep breath of water before you come back up into the air. And for a second are able to like get a little bit of clarity. It's like almost this sort of like drying weirdness of the air gives you clarity to phase walk, ba-yung, and suddenly..."
: The equivalent of going into a bathroom and splashing your face with cold water?
": Yeah, psh, splashing your face with cold air. And you, boom, are with Barry, phase walked over there, shunt a guy to the ground. That is your turn. Barry, that is going to be you."
: Sweet. Elbow drop on the guy on the ground.
: Go for it.
": Whoops, oh yeah."
": Yeah, that's absolutely gonna do it."
": Oh my god. Oh wait, I can. Oh wait, no I can't re-roll that. That's my fist. Six damage."
": Boom, with that extra three you elbow drop, crush this guy's wind pipe. There is one person left."
": Sweet, I will take a second attack on the... You know what? I'll go reckless, why not?"
Zac: Yes!
": Wow, we're living dangerously over here. We're not afraid."
": And it's a good thing I did. Dah, dah, dah, 21 to hit."
: 21 hits.
: Nice.
: Seven damage.
: Okay.
: And then bonus action off hand attack.
": Okay, seven damage and then roll again. Roll for this bonus action. Hits, 27 to hit."
: Yep.
": Come on, I'm gonna stop rolling these so bad."
": Ba, ba."
: And then an extra nine damage.
": You turn around and Phil's running up to you and says, hey now, come on. Murph: Back breaker! Ah!"
: Zed! Blam.
": Sorry, Phil."
": Phil is part of the prison industrial complex. Now Phil's gone. (laughing) You see, so yeah, you just fucking shatter this dude's spine. I had a whole thing! Klam!"
: Can I object interaction to see if anybody has like keycards or like anything in case things get closed on me?
": Give me an investigation. Yeah, absolutely."
Ally: I also am gonna have to pass.
: 14
Ally: I think maybe we can ll do those.
": Okay, good."
": But I also have a, Gunnie, did your thing get passed on? Can I still use my D6?"
: You can use your D6 whenever.
: Oh sweet. Maybe I'll save it.
: What'd you roll?
: I got a 14.
": You see, keycards elude you at moment but you do see all their batons and stuff. I don't know if that's..."
": Sweet, I'll grab some, I'll grab a baton."
": Yeah, grab a baton off one of them. Cool. That is going to be, that's Barry's turn. Skip, it's gonna be you."
Zac: I'm gonna continue to grab stuff that's in here.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, give me another investigate check."
": Cool, and this might be my object interaction or is this like..."
": Now this can be your object interaction, yeah, absolutely."
: Nat 20.
": Nat 20, incredible. Tell me...tell me, You can grab an item for everybody from here."
": Okay, I wanna get the breathers."
": Cool, I'm gonna say you grab a whole bag of breathers. You grab all the breathers."
: I forget if you had anything that you want.
: My phone.
: Can I grab some grenades and maybe use one of them?
": Yeah, absolutely."
": Okay, I'm gonna--"
: You should grab all the grenades.
": Yeah, grab all the grenades and--"
: Your jet pack.
": Yeah, I think I grabbed the jet pack last turn, right?"
: Now you grab it this turn.
": Yeah, I grab."
": So you throw the jet pack on. So here's what, on that nat you grab a bunch of, you grab all the grenades. You get Barry's gun. And..."
Zac: The breathers.
: And the re-breathers.
: What about my phone?
: And Margaret's phone.
": And Margaret's phone, great. So now I still have my action, bonus action. How far away is everyone from me, I think. It's like, still a good bit, right?"
Lou: Yep.
": Mm-hm. And I'm gonna say on a nat 20, as an object interaction, I'm gonna say that like hoisting all of that stuff unto yourself is all on that nat 20, one object interaction."
": Holy shit, okay."
": So you still have an action bonus, action, and movement left."
": Okay, I'm going to throw a stun grenade into that pod of men."
": Ha, ha!"
": Yeah, baby."
": Hell yeah. And what's the radius on those again, Em?"
Emily: I think it's everyone within 10 feet.
": Okay, let's see here, hold on."
": Oh wait, his might be different. So he can throw it as far as 30 plus his strength modifier times five. So whatever your strength modifier is times five."
Brennan: But it's a 10 foot radius?
": But it says, let me get the exact wording for you. But it's..."
": 30 is like directly in the middle of those guys, so."
Brennan: Yeah.
: “As an action you throw a grenade. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 con save.”
Brennan: That is literally every single one of them.
Ally: Yes!
"Brennan: I thought I was being so fucking slick with all those guys behind cover. Okay, I'm gonna roll six. And what's the normal D? It's constitution. What's the normal DC on that?"
: Normal DC is 14.
": 14, okay."
Ally: Okay.
: You're rolling six?
(sighing)
": Rolling six, DC 14, here we go. Let's see what happens."
"Emily: Wait, let me."
: Let's see what happens.
: Okay.
": Oh, I do have stun grenades. I was worried that I didn't have any left for a second."
": The stun grenade goes off. The two guards right in the middle closest to the stun grenade go out. Full stunned, unconscious. Has anything happened on a success, or no?"
": I think with stun grenades, because I think it's like--"
": No, if you succeed you succeed, yeah. So two of them are out. So you throw that. Pling, pling, pling, pling, pling, boom! And then you have a bonus action, I think."
": Looking at this, I was trying to see if I could get to the, out of this door over here. Kind of closer to my team. But I think it would just put me in the doorway so I would get shot up."
: Yeah.
": Probably, so I might just stay in here."
: Hell yeah.
: With the door closed.
": Hell yeah, absolutely. I'll also point out, it's a bonus action to activate that jet pack."
": Okay, I'll activate the jet pack, yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Cool, you just like raise up a little bit off the floor after throwing that grenade. Incredible, that is your turn. Sid, that's gonna be you."
"Emily: Okay, is anyone still standing amongst these guards? Or has Barry cleared out the situation?"
Brennan: It is cleared out. There are no guards left in the prison block with you.
"Emily: Great, then I will bonus action, activate my rocket boots."
: Woo!
"Emily: And then I will just, I mean it looks like there's, I think I'm just dashing."
: Hell yeah.
Emily: I don't have anything else I can do.
: Rocket boots give you a speed of?
": It's the same as my speed, yeah."
": Same, okay. Yeah, you activate that."
: So I go 60 feet.
"Brennan: So okay, Sid's gonna charge Hell yeah, action and movement. That's Sid. Baddies are gonna go."
"Emily: Wait, I thought there were no baddies left."
Murph: They're in the other room.
: In the other room.
": Okay, good, good, good. As long as I didn't like. Because you guys aren't getting any opportunity attacks, right?"
: Uh-uh.
": Okay, cool, great."
": Okay, those two guys are out. Skip is back in this other room. Bah, bah, bum. What was your roll on that check for the doors at 22?"
": 15 plus 11, 26."
": 26, okay."
": With my movement, though, can I nestle myself behind these people and essentially use them as cover."
"Brennan: For sure. You see one of the guys looks over at you and says,"
I appreciate the business card. I am Kilogram Demitrius. It was a pleasure to meet you.
: It was so good to meet you too. And what a fun situation to--
: I'm Krang Voltro!
": Whoa, hi, Krang. Krang and Kilogram."
": We partners, we smuggle. We are caught as criminals here. They put us in jail. Are you responsible for this jailbreak?"
": Absolutely, yeah, yeah. My team is absolutely doing that."
": Crazy, we hit the jackpot. Nice to know you, thank you for this jailbreak."
": So I mean, we're actually trying to get outta here and we're kind of the masterminds of this. So, if you see an opportunity to like, attack someone, and help us get to, because we're really good with computers."
: Oh sure!
: If you see any time to help us get to computers.
: Great!
: It's gonna mean that you get out.
": Yeah, you take lead, we fall in behind. You know, if we see an opportunity to club a head, you know, or something."
": Yeah, absolutely club some heads."
": Yeah, for sure, okay. Yeah, not our first rodeo, but very happy to sort of follow your lead here."
: I give him another business card.
": Wow, two, okay. Same information, great, yeah."
"Brennan: Okay, bad guys are gonna go. One of the bad guys is gonna try to beat that 26 to close the door."
: I also do wanna encourage them to go to our casino.
: A seven's not gonna do it. Cannot undo whatever Gunnie has done. You see one of these dudes is gonna run out to go get help from another part of the facility. Is gonna get all the way to the door. You see one of them is yelling at him.
Go get the Vercadian!
Zac: Ah.
"Brennan: Another one here is going to take an action. Oh wait, can they? They can use an action out of unconsciousness, but then they're still stunned, correct?"
": I think someone else needs to take an action to get them out of, let's see."
: Unconsciousness.
: On a failed save a creature is unconscious for one minute until it takes damage or until someone uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake.
": Okay, so these two awake guys are going to slap the two asleep guys and get them back up. So pap, pap, pap."
"Ally: Okay, okay."
": Hey, you bought yourself a round of not getting shot. Okay, so now we once more have four guards up and ready. I'm sorry, we have actually five. There are five guards up and ready behind this counter here. Okay, and what's their line of sight like I wonders to myself. Okay."
": They did just use their actions, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, they did. Okay, continuing on in the order. Gunnie, that's you again."
Lou: Double dash.
": Hell yeah, okay Gunnie is gonna move 60. Yeah, Gunnie moves another 60 down the hall. Bada-boom."
: Just really dreaming. Dreaming of having my stuff back.
"Brennan: Woo. All right, Gunnie you are all the way around the corner now. Bada-boom, great. Margaret, that's gonna be you."
Ally: I'm holding my turn until after Riva. In case I wanna move the critical analysis to someone else.
"Brennan: Okay, so you're gonna extend your turn after Riva, gotcha. Riva, that's your turn."
Siobhan: How close am I to my psycho-drone? Pretty close?
"Brennan: Oo, interesting. I think we said 100 feet, right?"
"Siobhan: Yeah, I think."
Zac: Is your psycho-drone with me?
Siobhan: Yeah.
Zac: In that stuff?
Brennan: Yes. The psycho-drone is amongst the stuff there.
Zac: Oh.
Brennan: You are not within 100 feet of it.
"Siobhan: All right, is Barry carrying me, a medium sized creature? Considering Barry doesn't have his extremely large guns on him."
"Brennan: He is a medium sized creature, yes."
"Siobhan: Great, then I will psychic throw us."
: Yes!
: 30 feet.
: Hell yeah.
: Then am I within 100 feet of the?
: No.
: Ah.
Murph: Do you want me to go? Don't we go on the same?
": Yeah, Barry can go first."
Murph: Do you want me to go first and dash?
": Yeah, if you do that. Because I've gotten you 30 feet."
"Murph: Sweet, then I will. Yeah, okay. So I'll go first. I'll do, I believe--"
": Wait, if you do your bonus action in dash does that? How far?"
": If you can get us 30 feet and I dash, that's 90 feet. And I believe that gets us into this room with the stairs that we can get some cover."
: Great.
": And be closer, would that get us to the drone?"
": Let me see if that's within 100 feet, hold on. If you can get into that room, that's within 100 feet."
: Great.
": Okay, great."
": So why don't we? Okay, so in that case, I will dash 60 feet and then I'm gonna bonus action go into the zone so that I can eat some damage."
Brennan: Cool.
: And then that is my turn. And you can push-pull us and then go into your drone.
: Great.
"Brennan: Hell yeah, okay Barry is gonna move 60 feet down dashing. Go into the zone. And then Riva, you're gonna push another 30 feet. So you guys just clear into this chamber with the stairs here."
Siobhan: Great and then I will bonus action jump into my psycho-drone.
"Brennan: Um, boop. Okay, TaleSpire we're gonna have that psycho-drone activate in the room with Skip. So Riva, you hurl yourselves down and go limp. As you do, I'm gonna need a constitution saving throw."
Siobhan: I'm not good at those.
: You have all those buffs on you.
"Siobhan: Oh, but I did get an 18. Is that enough, because if not use one of these."
"Brennan: 18 is enough. You close your mouth, lean your head into Barry's chest and as you catatonic to warg into your psycho-drone, you keep your gills covered basically so you're not taking big, drying breaths of air."
"Siobhan: Okay, great."
"Brennan: Okay, yes. That is going to be, that's after Riva, it's gonna be Margaret."
"Ally: Right, full dash action and then I'm gonna move my critical analysis to myself. And anyone within 10 feet gets a bonus to their AC of... Three plus. Yeah, three. It's small."
Lou: But it's mighty.
: It's small but it's mighty.
: Hell yeah.
: It's me and you coming up the rear.
": Yeah, absolutely."
": Me, you, and Skip."
"Brennan: Okay. Margaret, you're gonna take another 60 feet of movement here?"
"Ally: Yes, please."
"Brennan: Okay, Margaret's gonna go another 60 down the hall. After Margaret that's gonna be Skip."
"Zac: Do I? Okay, so this guard."
: Yeah.
"Zac: Does he have any rogue features at all? Like, could I take--"
Brennan: No.
: Okay.
: I wanna stop that guy from getting the Vercadian protector droid. Because that feels pretty fucking bad. But I don't really know what this guy adds to any sort of shots and things like that.
"Brennan: Cool, yeah, yeah, yeah."
: Has he noticed? Do they know that Skip is not Skip?
Brennan: They saw a stun grenade come out of that room.
": Ah, right, yes. But they're stupid, right? They're kinda dumb?"
: You got more grenades.
": Yeah, yeah I do."
: Is there a way to give them disadvantage and then throw a stun?
: I can only do that to one person.
": Oh. Well, I mean there's one like sergeant."
: You could do that to the Vercadian protector droid.
": But they're probably past that, right?"
: Yeah.
: He has like legendary resistances.
: But the Vercadian protector droid did burn one legendary resistance today.
": Well there were two of them. We don't know which one it was, right?"
": Is there any way, can you use your jet pack to essentially get in the doorway and block their way and attack them?"
: I actually don't think I see the guy who's going to get it.
Brennan: He's at the door.
: Oh. Like what features does this guard have? Do I think I have any sort of guard-esque abilities?
": You, in this body, you can make an attack. You get one attack per round. I mean, I don't know if you can drop this dude in a single hit."
": If you guys grapple, you guys probably have the same stats."
: Yeah.
": Probably it's just a 50-50 shot. And we have things, or other people."
": Well, Riva's in here now with the stuff."
": Yeah, I'm in here now with the stuff."
: So you could be throwing stun grenades if you wanna go out and grapple.
": Yeah, okay, so I will. I guess I'll hand you this."
: Oo!
: I have a lot of stun grenades too. So it's not just your three.
: Oh you do?
": Yeah, so there are a lot in there."
Brennan: So what's the move?
: So I'm gonna fly past everyone and just tackle that guy.
": Hell yeah, give me a grapple check."
Ally: Come on.
: Can Handy Annie help with that?
: Huh?
: Can Handy Annie help?
": Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah."
": Yeah, she can poke him in the eye."
": Grapple is, what do I add to that, sorry?"
: Full.
Emily: Pew!
"Zac: Should be athletic, right?"
: Strength is plus one and then you add your proficiency.
": Okay, so that's a 17."
": 17, okay. You got a 17, I'm gonna roll in front of the board. This guy adds the same thing, it's a plus one."
(players groaning)
"Thwarts you, gets you off of him. But you are there on top of him. So we're gonna move that other guard there with you."
Zac: I should have thrown a grenade at him.
"Brennan: All right, that's Skip. Sid, that's you."
: Okay. How far away from Handy Annie am I?
": Now that Handy Annie is with Zac, you are still more than 100 feet away."
": Okay, but am 130 feet away?"
": Let's find out. Yes, you are more than 130 feet away. Actually, but not if you move. If you were to move."
": Well, no, because I need to be. I was thinking of being within 100 feet of Handy Annie and then trying to have her use, like see through her to basically hack the controls to keep that door closed."
: Gotcha. You… If you move you'll be within range.
: If I move I'll be within 100 feet?
": You'll be within 130. Oh, but you're, yeah."
": No, no, I need to be within 100. Okay, who is within? Like, if I ran into this other room are there people for me to shoot to get people out of the way?"
: You'd have to move in to find out.
": Okay so, I move in."
": What's your speed right now, 50?"
": No, my speed right now is just 30."
": Okay, you sprint in there. You look around, you have an action and bonus action. You see no people here that are firing at you. So no one in here that you can see."
": There's no one here? Okay, then I just, you know, I just keep dashing. There's nothing else to do without spells."
: Hell yeah.
: Just keep running.
": All right, so."
: I dash but I'll look for cover wherever I land.
": Hell yeah. Sid's gonna move 30 feet and get to the top of the landing. Okay, so you're not gonna go in front of the open door. You're gonna like hide behind."
": Right, I'm gonna hide behind the open door."
": All right, so Sid ducks for cover behind the open door right here. So we'll put Sid right there. Bad guys are gonna go. Five dudes turn around and open on Skip. Here we go. Okay. Five guys turn around, open on Skip and the other guy's gonna swing with a baton as well. So the baton comes in. That's a hit with the baton."
: Okay.
": Five blaster rifles coming in. Okay, that's... Those are misses, misses, misses. That's bizarrely a miss too. Okay, so the first one. Is this actually gonna fucking work?"
": Are they all gonna miss? And just, obviously destroy this guard next to me."
(chuckling)
Ally: Luck check!
": Okay, eight damage from the guy right next to you."
: Okay.
: You have five hit points left.
: Okay.
Emily: Oh god.
: You're a wiener.
": If this is a one or a two, you're still up."
Ally: On a D8?
"B: On a D8, one in four chance. That's a four. Skip, you go down. You have the jet pack on, but the rest of the equipment is right here."
Z: Great.
"B: So Skip, you are down. But that was all the bad guys attacks. So, top of the order, Gunnie, that's you."
Lou: 60 feet.
": Gunnie makes it all the way into the next chamber. Prisoners are all gonna move as far as they can but also behind that door waiting for Sid to do stuff. Riva, that's you."
: If I psychically throw this guy who's in front of the door at the other guys.
: Yeah.
: Will that knock anybody prone? It seems like...
: Sure.
: If I had a man thrown at me I would probably fall over.
": Your honor, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, go for it. You wanna throw him?"
": Yeah, I do."
: That guy that was hitting me with the baton.
": Yeah, it's a DC 16 strength saving throw."
: Okay. He succeeds.
: I do it with heightened spell.
: Okay.
: Disadvantage.
: He fails.
: Great.
Ally: Hell yes.
": So yeah, I throw him at all of these dudes behind the desk."
": Bam, cool. What's the range on that? How far can you throw him?"
": He's medium, right?"
: Yeah.
: So 30 feet.
": Yeah, you throw him right into those dudes and I'll have someone else make a strength save. They fail. One of those dudes goes prone. Do they take damage?"
": Hang on, yeah. Yes, 2D8 force damage."
: Wow.
: Wow! Okay.
: Nice.
": And both he and the thing that it hits take. Oh, actually there is rules in here. If the end of this movement the creature or object strikes another creature or object they both take 2D8 force damage."
": Hell yeah, go ahead and roll."
: Great. So they take five damage.
Brennan: No! All right.
Siobhan: I'm off with my rolls today.
"B: Bam! You throw a dude into another dude. Woof, dealing five points of damage to both of them. So both that dude and the one guy he hits take five points of damage. Barry, that's you."
Murph: Sweet. Can you shine a light on where our gear is?
Brennan: Gear is all right here.
": Oh, it's in that room. Oh, I see it. It's in that other room, okay."
": Oh, it's in that room, okay."
": Can I, with 30 feet of running and then 30 feet of my jump can I get there?"
": Oh maybe, can I have object interaction to grab Gunnie's gun and step into this room?"
: Barry's gun?
": I keep on doing that today, Barry's gun."
": You have all of the equipment. If you wanna just take 30 feet of movement and walk into the doorway, you can."
": Great, yes, I will do that."
": Cool, so pyscho-drone walks right next to Sid carrying all of the equipment that Zac described. So right here in the doorway is the psycho-drone."
: Great.
: Riva-claus.
: Sweet.
: Riva-claus!
": Okay, so then can I?"
"So then, without even doing my jump yet."
"Brennan: Cool, you have 30 feet of movement. You can get right next to it, object interaction, grab your gun."
": Sweet, I grab my gun. I would like to shoot a burst at those dudes that are all bunched up."
"B: Hell yeah, and that's a 10 foot cube, right?"
M: I believe so.
"B: Yeah, you can hit three of those dudes. You wanna target the injured ones, or just uninjured ones?"
": You know what, let's do. Let's go crazy. Let's go uninjured ones."
": That's crazy, bro."
": You're crazy, dude."
"Brennan: Go ahead, they're rolling reflex saves. How much damage did you roll?"
": My burst is two, right? So..."
"B: Okay, you deal 13 damage and if they got the save they take half, correct?"
M: I think they do.
On a burst do they just not get hit?
Is that how it works?
Or do they just--
"B: Oh, on a burst they just don't get hit."
That's exactly right.
"Okay, so two of these guys"
riddled with hi-on beams.
"Murph: Yeah, nice."
Ally: Amazing.
Siobhan: Amazing.
M: And now I would like to second burst attack at a different little assembly of dudes.
"B: Cool. You go for another group of two. They fail their saves, go ahead and roll damage."
": Oh, we roll that too. That one is 13, 15 damage."
"Brennan: So Riva, you, fwoom, throw that guy, step into the doorway with arms full of gear. Barry, in pajamas you leap into the doorway and. (imitates gunfire)"
Barry Syx: I still look ripped in my pajamas!
: Wow it really is morning.
: Four of those guys have dropped in that one attack.
Murph: Is there anyone left?
Brennan: There's one person standing.
Murph: I'm going to jump on them with the bonus action. With the five damage.
Brennan: Five is exactly what we needed.
(cheering)
"Brennan: Boom! That whole guard station goes up. There is one dude still in the doorway about to go get the Vercadian. Barry, you've cleaned out this guard post here. Skip is dead on the ground, but Margaret it is your turn."
": Wait, didn't you throw the guy who was gonna get the Vercadian?"
": Oh, you did! He's dead. Yeah, he's gone."
": Full dash, baby, dash."
: Okay.
": Okay, but there is one. In that case, you just dropped this five. No you, I had to roll an extra save. There was another dude in that 10 foot area. That guy also is dead. Yeah, all the. Dude, Barry has killed all the guards in that room."
"Siobhan: Incredible, Barry."
": Margaret, full dash. And actually, at this moment we are going to come out of combat initiative."
: And I just keep running.
: All you guys keep sprinting.
(heavy panting)
Siobhan: I strap one of the aqua breathers to my unconscious body.
Brennan: So you are now carrying yourself and strap a breather to yourself. Give me a wisdom saving throw to just sort of deal with the existential weirdness of that moment.
"Siobhan: Okay, well I do roll with advantage for wisdom saving throws. So that is a 13 plus eight which is 21."
: Woo!
Siobhan: I'm fine!
"Brennan: Yeah, this is just a wonderful moment of self care as you attach an aquatic re-breather to yourself."
: I get out Handy Annie and try to find Skip a new body.
": Yeah, Norman Takamori's just running through."
: Can I knock out?
: Can we close line him? Can we hold our hands together and run at him?
"Brennan: Bam! Slug back in Skip. And you, chair's still warm, baby."
Skip: Right on.
Brennan: Incredible.
Skip: My nose.
: Oh my god.
Skip: Can someone heal this guy that I inhabited? I feel bad for him.
: Oh yeah.
Gunnie: No!
(laughing)
: Let's take him with us.
"Brennan: Incredible, so that's. So all of you rush into that room. The stuff you grabbed is what you were able to grab. The alarm system is still going off, but now you see you are at the guard station here. You got your gadgeteer harness on, tech focus. You have the re-breather on. So there's this little sort of bubbling chambers of water on a collar over Riva's gills. You will be completely fine from here on out."
: Great.
"Brennan: So, that's going to. Guns back, da, da, da, da."
"Emily: Grenades back, oh it's good to have you. I'm like a chicken with her eggs with my grenades."
Brennan: So this is the end of the fourth round of the alarms going off. Do you do anything in the fifth round? Use your object interaction to grab stuff. Do you do anything at this guard's comms station or do you continue to just move through?
"Ally: I would love to get on the comm system and say,"
This is Gnosis.
": Okay, you go ahead and say, this is Gnosis. What do you say as Gnosis?"
"Ally: I say,"
"This is Gnosis. Help us flee and I will do what ever you want on Rubian Five, Lucienne."
Brennan: Give me a deception check.
": Okay. Oh, fuck."
: 14.
: Dope.
: Plus.
Ally: That is a 21.
"Brennan: Okay, and you're just broadcasting that out over the comms."
Ally: Yeah.
"Brennan: Cool. You broadcast it over the comms. Lucienne hears that. Sort of wheresoever that is. You see... ba, ba, bum."
": Can I hack, or no, it's her turn."
": Yeah, no, no, go for it."
: I wanna turn off the alarm protocol.
"B: Okay, go ahead and give me a hacker's check. You see that one of the younger siblings comes over to you and says, let me give you hand with that. And gives you the help action. She seems very proficient."
"G: Hey, sorry, what's your name?"
: Oh me? I’m Jasmine Martinez.
"Lou: Well, that didn't help much. That's a 19. What sort of help will that do?"
: She is going to give you potent aptitude.
"Ally: Oh, shit!"
: Oo!
": Jasmine, you really know your way around one of these things."
Lou: That's a one.
B: Dirty 20 is gonna get the job done.
"S: Oh, thank god. Can we look in these lockers and see if there's anything cool in them that's not ours?"
"B: If you wanna take time to do it, you can."
": No, we gotta go."
: Let's go.
"S: You've got one turn while everybody's doing this. We might as well have a look. I'm not doing anything right now. Oh, I should contact Gnosis and tell him hot exit."
"B: Yeah, so you're gonna send out this psychic alert of like, hot exit, we gotta go."
E: Should I cast smuggle on us? Are we stealthing our way outta here?
": Yeah, maybe."
": Yeah, should I put on a guard uniform? I have a disguise kit. I don't know if we have time for that, but."
: I think we should all put on guard's uniforms.
": Yeah, everyone should take off their little lime clothing."
: Can we get the prisoners around?
"Jasmine, would you and your friends be willing to put on prison guard uniforms and escort us out of here? As if, you know, we were being led away or something?"
": Yeah, you see."
"They're, yeah--"
: We've got a platoon's worth of people here.
"B: You see the other prisoners all take a second. They say,"
"Uh, yeah we can do that."
"B: Yeah, you see that there's a. So Kilogram and Krang both start getting into prison guard uniforms and undressing the guys. You see that the Martinez siblings, the other one introduces themself and says,"
"Hi, I'm Estrea."
: Nice to meet you.
": Nice to meet you, as well. Okay, you're Acme Ashman, right? We watched the fight, it was great. We got arrested earlier this morning, yeah, yeah."
: For what?
": Oh, we’re hackers. We're incredibly dangerous hackers."
": Oh, very cool."
": Yeah, yeah, for sure."
"B: So you see another woman who's escaped here that you haven't interacted with yet. Grabs one of the lieutenant's things and puts it on. You see, she's a young black woman. Has like these hot pink locks tied up around her head. Turns around and says,"
"okay, is it okay if I'm the supervisor?"
"G: Yeah. Here's some stuff about being a supervisor, potent aptitude."
": Cool, great, got it. I did community theater for a long time, so I get it."
": Very cool, what's your name?"
": I'm Shawna, nice to meet you."
: Shawna.
": I'm not a hacker, I'm a non-fiction author. But it's nice to meet you."
": Oh wait, why are you locked up?"
: I wrote a sort of essay about United Free Trade Planets. I'm a political dissident.
": Oh great, we have a JibJob station in our ship if you need a work space."
": You know, I actually am not. I'm banned from JibJob. I wrote an article about--"
": We get you, we'll get around it, don't worry."
": Oh, I wrote an article about Mr. Moon Jones."
: Oo!
": We would love to read it. Our ship is a hot dog, you're always welcome there."
: I give her a business card. It's a limited edition one.
: Thank you. I don't have a business card. I can give you a link to my blog?
: Very cool.
: Absolutely. (laughing)
": So, they get dressed up."
: I take it and immediately forget it.
: Okay.
": H-T-T-P, colon."
: You guys head into the... next.
": This is a pretty solid plan, I think. I think we look legit, you know?"
Siobhan: I think so.
: Oh my gosh they all switch into guard uniforms so perfectly.
": Oh, I love it."
": Amazing, amazing. The doors open. All of you guys step out into the next area and you see a number of guards in the next area and then two armored shock troops and a giant Vercadian protector droid in the next area. As you all step out, the. You see the sort of masked UFTP shock troopers go, Halt. And hold up the guns. You see Shawna steps up and goes. These prisoners engaged a hacking protocol within the prison and that prison is suspect. It is a bad prison."
: It is really shining through.
": It is a bad prison and it doesn't work, okay? There as Gunnie mentioned when he did it, because he broke it, he hacked it."
: I was the man who hacked it.
": So we have to, what we have to do is get all of them to a better prison. And we gotta do it right now. And I work with you. It's my first day, which is why you've never met me. (laughing)"
: Let me go! And I fake fight.
": Knock it off, and I've had enough! Okay? I'm prison guard and the last thing I need is a prisoner trying to escape."
: Riva is rapt by the performance.
": So at the end of the day, bottom line, we should all, as UFTP employees, work together to get them to a better prison, now."
: Boo!
: Boo!
: I wanna stay in our old prison.
: Shawna's gonna roll deception.
: Can she have advantage from just the spectacle of it all? And then she's got a D6 from potent aptitude.
: Let's see what happens.
Ally: She does.
": Okay, she's gonna add a plus two."
"Ally: Come on, baby."
: That is a six.
": Disengage, fly past. (laughing)"
: Incredible. You see...
: It's my first day.
": Okay, so you go to disengage and fly past. Shawna says that. Yeah, the shock troops look around. The Vercadian looks at you, Sid."
: I wink.
: Give me persuasion.
: Okay.
": Come on. Come on, baby."
": Oh, can I add?"
: Mm-hm.
": Okay, I only have a plus one. But I get to add a five."
: Mm-hm.
: You add an eight.
: I add an eight?
": Yeah, yeah, you get to add an eight."
: That's a 25. Because I got 16 on the die.
: Android channel opens up in your head. Now work's done. (laser firing) This Vercadian just incinerates all of the UFTP soldiers in this space.
": Wait, the UFTP soldiers that were dressed up? (laughing) Can I? Can I?"
: I would think the droid would be able to do--
": The siblings, no!"
: She did truly so bad on her.
": I'm gonna roll the insight for the protector droid. Eight, that's high enough to see through Shawna."
: Okay!
: Thank god.
: Yeah.
: But just Shawna or?
": Oh no, he can tell the whole thing is a lie."
: Poor guys.
: Oh my god.
: So just the UFTP people here. (mimics gunfire)
: This guy's huge.
Brennan: Lights them up.
: He's gorgeous.
: Welcome to the gunner channel.
": You see he. You see that this Vercadian protector droid walks over to the comms station, holds out a hand, inserts something into the comms, downloads something. You see his eyes flicker with something that seems totally unrelated to anything having to do with any of you."
: Great.
": And then, retracts it. Walks over to you, Gunnie, and says. I believe you have the ability to control droids against their will, is that correct?"
: Uh...
: I'm actually a droid and I'm like his best friend and he uses it real responsibly.
": Yeah, it's very, it's only in specific circumstances."
: Now would seem like such a circumstance.
: Okay.
: I would like some of the tech you would use to perform such an action.
: Uh...
: You have like darts and little tracer bullets that you would use to like fire a...
": Scramble, yeah."
": Yeah, to like a scramble interface."
": Yeah, it's fine."
: Can I owe him?
": I can give him, I'll give him an ion grenade because it makes things need to reboot."
": He looks at that and says, perfect. He takes your little thing and stabs it into his android flesh, pft. Takes the ion grenade and says, everyone take a few steps back. (whooshing) Sets it off in himself with a little bit of char on his face and says, funny how competent those prisoners were."
": Ha, ha, ha! All right, let's fucking roll."
: Let's fucking run!
: I think I dip him and I kiss him. (laughing) You are my favorite droid I've ever met.
": You see, yeah, he's. Yeah, kisses back and goes, you can keep my soul anytime. (laughing)"
: I like really waddle.
: You waddle! (laughing)
": Well, guess I better be going."
: That's your one allow in skates.
: A roller waddle.
": Vercadians are hot, there's just no two ways around it. They're hot droids."
": Okay, you guys dip out of here. As you all quickly exit from this sort of prison block you're immediately back in the halls of Myrmidon Station. Which again, the difference between public and private spaces in this space station is kind of a misnomer. It's all private spaces. Parts of it are made to look like a city, because that's the right look for that hallway or that part of the station. But it's all just a big corporate hub, right? You get away from Vercadian protector droid who remains stationed at that part of the sort of, that prison block. As you escape and move your way out, you see Kilogram and Krang. Kilogram says, well, it's very good to work with you. We going to flee, but hope I run into you, goodbye. And they sort of rush off. You see that the Martinez siblings both look at you as well as Shawna Waters. And say, hey, we, it's, you have to forgive me, but it seems like you guys are wanted for things that are so extremely above the pay grade for what we got caught for, maybe this is..."
": Oh, we got arrested for trespassing."
": Oh, well that's not so bad. What was that about Gnosis?"
: Hm.
: At that point I did think we were just on a tiny little ship that we had already taken over. But you're letting know that it's a whole space station city that I broadcasted that to?
": Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure."
": So is it too late to be like, oh, I didn't do that. (laughing) I didn't even make that roll and I didn't do that."
: 35 minutes later.
": Look, um, I'm. (chuckling)"
": I will say, that went over the prison block."
": Gorgeous, we love to hear it, we love to say it."
": So, pretty much everyone else."
": Yeah, yeah, yeah."
": Well, Jas, you know. I mean you can run off, but we should hang out sometime. We could do--"
": Yeah, yeah, yeah. You see that she like taps your wrist pad and goes, boop- boop, and a little contact slides over."
": Yeah, we should do pleasure sometime or something."
: Do pleasure?
: Oh my god! I push.
: I grab Gunnie and I just--
: Subtle control on Jasmine! Subtle control.
": That other girl, it seemed like she liked you."
: That was weird that it worked.
": You see Shawna, the author looks over to you and says, I'll remember. And she disappears."
": Bravo, Shawna, bravo."
: It worked last time!
": Am I right about this? She rushes off. Cool, so."
: They all have our business cards.
": Yeah, I've been giving out all my limited edition business cards. All Sidney's in all sorts of positions."
": I want those, actually. I want like playing cards of us."
": Yeah, I wanna collect 'em all."
: Of these characters.
: There's 52 of them.
": So, here's what I'm gonna need from all of you. What are you doing? You have grabbed, again, the gear that Skip mentioned has been grabbed, right? But you--"
": Oh god, we forgot something huge, didn't we?"
": The gear that Skip mentioned has been grabbed. All of you take off. As you are rushing to the hallway, is there anything you do as you approach the hangar?"
": I mean, are we trying to stealth or is that a foolish idea?"
: I think they know this prison break has happened. We probably should get the.
: Just run to the--
: Prioritize speed over.
: Run to the dog.
": All right, then."
: What about Auma?
: Is Auma here?
": Well, she's on the space station still, isn't she?"
: Can we get in touch with her?
: I feel like she has a lot of money.
: We could reach back out.
: We can reach out.
": That is a lot of money,"
": Sid, what do you think?"
": I mean, I figure, you know, she made 150 million dollars and then we can reach out to her to do business again in the future."
: Yeah.
: That's very forgiving of you.
: Why?
: Hm?
: I think what she did was totally understandable.
": I hold hands with Sid, it's okay."
": And there's no part of me that feels slighted, or jilted, or anything like that. I think Mommy is nice."
": Some oil is coming out of your nose. But yeah, definitely."
: Mommy is nice.
: Mommy is nice.
": I love my mommy. Anyways, let's get fucking going. (chuckling)"
": Yeah, let's get fucking going."
: Starting to cry.
": I'll race you, Sid. And I just start sprinting."
: I'll race y'all back.
: Can I do a perception check on like the surroundings? Is someone within view?
: Yeah. I'm just gonna cast a few things on the run.
: I'd also like to connect with Gnosis and the Princeps to see where they are.
": Yeah, you send that connection."
": Oh yeah, where are Princeps?"
": Yeah, you see. Now that you are no longer befuddled, you perfectly connect with Zortch. Zortch reaches out to you as well and says, hey, we're at a betting station."
: For?
Emily: What is a betting station?
": What is a, what?"
": Well, I was making a special order. I was making french toast."
: Oh my god.
: I was making french toast for Malika and Chloe and Stax. You know the girl guides?
: Yes.
: And they mentioned they knew a horse that was a sure thing.
: Oh.
: And they bet Gnosis.
: No!
: Um.
": No, come on!"
: They bet Gnosis. And they made two million credits.
": Yes, come on!"
: They won?
": Yeah, so we're just on the way back to the ship."
": Okay, great!"
: I should have told you.
: Yes!
": Wait, but you're on your way back to the ship?"
": Yeah, and they have Gnosis. Gnosis was sort of a down payment, a collateral thing."
: Okay.
: But they won the bet.
: Well...
: Who was the bet against?
Brennan: What's that?
: Do they remember who the bet was against?
: Who handled Gnosis in this?
Brennan: What's that?
: Who handled Gnosis in this?
": Oh, Stax."
": Oh, okay. So it wasn't given over to someone else."
: Temporarily it was held in sort of a pawn area at the betting station.
": It's been copied, for sure."
": No, why would they? No, let's just get back to ship."
": Yeah, let's just get back."
: We can figure out that stuff later.
": Okay, I also let Stax know that we need to hurry because we're at a sort of cigar emporium right now."
": Oh my god, these girls."
": Absolutely, pick me up a bunch."
": I'm gonna psychically connect to those kids and say, you are in so much trouble, young ladies. I promise you 100.000 credits if you helped to rescue us and you absolutely did not do that. Your place on this ship, young ladies."
": You see, you psychically hear Stax say, ah, put a sock in it, ya can of tuna!"
": I don't have to put a sock in it. I can talk to you with a sock in my mouth, you silly little brat."
: I'm gonna kill ya!
: No you're not.
": You see, cool. They have been alerted and are rushing back to the ship. Did you guys say you were casting some stuff as you were running?"
: I'm gonna cast sabotage charges and bump my jet pack once we get close.
: Can I do an insight check to see if we're fucking forgetting something?
: Lucienne and I mean Barry Nine. Are they around? Do we see them anywhere?
": No, not that you can see."
: Can I psychically feel them around anywhere?
": I mean, I have all my gear right? I have all my gear."
: Mm-hm.
": He very specifically said, we have what I grabbed."
": Yeah, just what Skip grabbed."
": But all they would have taken from me was my grenades and my tech casting focus, right?"
": Yeah, exactly. So you have your grenades and your tech casting."
": We have money and everything, right?"
: Did I get my boots?
": Money, yeah. What was that?"
: My boots that shoot straight out?
": Yeah, whittled some, made sure--"
": I'll say your boots, yeah, you guys have your boots."
: I'm assuming that my boots were on my pyscho-drone.
: Your boots are very special and we have to preserve the boots.
": I haven't used those boots yet, and if I don't use them by the end of this season I'm gonna be really sad."
: That's up to you.
: I'm trying!
: Do we have our comms?
": No, I don't think you grabbed your comms."
": I'll buy us new, comms are cheap."
": All right, cool, great. So, you've casted whatever spells you're gonna cast. As you approach the hangar are you doing anything or are you just booking it?"
: Perception check.
: I guess we might as well stealth if we know we're waiting for Zortch. Because now we're not doing a super hot exit.
: Should we meet him somewhere else?
": I mean, what is?"
: We gotta get in that ship.
: It's all a UFTP planet. We can't really re-land.
: Let's stealth to the ship. That will get us there around--
": Wait, can I cast probe mind? So, as we're outside the ship."
: Are we? Are we back to the ship?
": Nope, not yet."
": So, as we go, you know, it will take up to one minute. I can just sense everybody around me."
": Cool, what's the range on that?"
: It's 30 feet.
: So everywhere around me I can detect the presence of a creature.
Zac: 30 feet?
: Any creature that's within 30 feet around me.
Brennan: Cool.
: Apart from androids and constructs.
": Cool. You are heading out to the hangar. I'm gonna give you guys, go ahead and give me a group stealth check, real quick."
: I give Handy Annie back to you.
: Okay.
": I'm gonna go into a rage again, just in case anything bad happens."
": I'm going to cast smuggle on us, so everyone add 10."
: A natural 20.
"Brennan: Natural 20, baby."
: My expertise makes it 31.
: Jesus.
: Everyone add a 10.
: Everyone add 10. Is that a 41?
: That's a 41.
: I got a 31.
: I also got a 31.
: 25.
: 15.
": What, we add 10?"
: 10.
: 21.
: The lowest was a 15.
": Okay, the latest. So the lowest of those is a 31, correct?"
: 15.
: I got a 21.
": Oh, 21. But I mean, the top three. So as a group check you passed a 31 stealth."
: Yes.
: You know.
: So. What I'm gonna say is this.
: Just putting pockets of air under Margaret's feet.
: Okay.
: Under my little heels.
": Yeah, Margaret's got really loud heels. That's why she's bad at stealth."
": They usually click, and also, that's a power move and I like that about myself right now, thank you."
: Yes.
": Hell yeah. Okay. So, let's move to the board. With that 31 stealth, here's what I'm gonna say. That's so good."
": Just for the record, I did slip a business card behind the Vercadian protector droid's ear."
": Hide it a little bit more, hide it a little bit more."
": Okay, I'm gonna say with that smuggle check you guys are able to go into a dead sprint. You go into a dead sprint. I'm gonna let you start. Anywhere on the--"
Zac: Oh my god.
"Brennan: Yeah, here's the hangar."
"Lou: Oh, it's still loading for me. Oh okay, there it is."
Emily: I'm not seeing anything.
"Siobhan: Oh my god, where the fuck is the ship?"
"Lou: Oh, another Vercadian protector droid."
"Siobhan: Oh god, we're so far away."
Zac: That feels not good in this scenario.
"Siobhan: Yeah, there's another droid here."
Lou: That's not fun!
Emily: How do we even get to our ship?
Siobhan: There's like a lot of UFTP security.
Lou: It looks like we can go up top. Or we could go across this catwalk here.
"Siobhan: We can go across this catwalk. Is there, oh god."
": I'm gonna let you guys start at any point on this map. With that 31 stealth, you can start at any point on this map, starting this encounter completely hidden. You just cannot be on the actually hangar bay. So, you can be, in other words you can be down below. You can be up on the mezzanine. You can be coming from one of these entrance things here. You can even be up in this crazy patchwork over here. Like, off in the corner."
: I feel like if we could come out of this door over here. Can everybody see that?
"Emily: Yeah, I can see it."
Lou: Can we drop down a level?
": What if we started like in this little area. Like, oh whoops. Like over here."
"Siobhan: Yeah, can we start over there?"
"Brennan: I'm not gonna let you start right there but what I'll say is this, the closest I can get you to there is you guys can start in this weird. You see where my little flashlight is going around? I'll do a little measurement tool."
Zac: I don't see it.
"Siobhan: Oh, up there?"
Brennan: You guys see up here?
Zac: Yeah.
"Brennan: It's up there, partially hidden from everything."
Ally: Oo!
"Brennan: That's the closest to that point you were point out, Zac, that you guys can start and get on that 31 stealth check."
": Wow, incredible, guys."
: I already used so many of my spells.
": I am actually, I'm good for spells. Well, we do have smuggle on us. We could just keep trying to..."
: Yeah.
: Stealth it until we get caught.
": Oh, yeah, because three of us can fly, right?"
: Yeah.
: And then Barry can jump 30 feet.
: I can just jump.
: And you can misty step.
: I'll probably take some damage.
: Margaret can send some emails.
": Yeah. That sound effect is like, (whooshing) you know?"
"Brennan: So you guys are perfectly hidden up on that ledge. You've snuck through some air vents, got here. You see your ship and the place swarming with soldiers and a Vercadian droid. What's the move from that ledge?"
: Do we get a sense. Can Riva tap in and know if Gnosis is back on the ship yet?
: Riva.
: Yes.
": Hidden in the shadows, on the other side of the hangar bay are three galactic girl guides, an alien royal, and Gnosis pinned down because the place is crawling with UFTP security."
Siobhan: God damn it.
Brennan: They are gonna have a short run to the ship. Their run is only 125 feet to the ramp.
"Ally: Oh, okay."
"Siobhan: Oh, they're right here. So they just have to get up this ramp, basically."
": Yes, and you see some JibJobbers down there as well."
": Okay. Oh, these are the JibJobbers and then the others are..."
": Yeah, also Aurora Nebbins is out on the ramp waiting for you guys to get back."
Siobhan: Aurora!
Ally: Aurora needs water.
: I feel like we stealth for as long as we can.
: I think so too.
": I almost think like, if we can, if we're stealthing and maybe--"
: Stealth through the air!
": And maybe if, I mean, the more we can create distractions behind us. You know, not like necessarily shooting a gun but like."
Lou: Yep.
"B: This is a large hangar filled with, not just like prison guards. This is like UFTP shock troops and that Vercadian who is not the one that had flirtatious banter with Sidney earlier."
: Mm-hm.
: More than flirtatious banter.
: We could also do slippery puppet operation mark. Because I've still got two psycho-drones back on the ship.
": I only bought one of those. I only bought one of those charts, one of those."
": No, no, no, but I can run off and be a distraction. Is what I'm saying."
": Right, that's true, yeah. Because we have so many."
: Just like a slippery puppet.
: Oh you could just go down?
": Yeah. I can draw them all to me, maybe."
": Well, have we? I mean, we can just try to get through the air with all of our flying right now and if something goes wrong then we have a backup plan."
: Then we have that as...
": Like, because we don't really. No one's really seen us yet."
: Yeah.
: And we're so close to the ship.
": Do we like, is our flying gonna be loud?"
": One of the things to consider too is that you guys might be able to fly through and you could have that smuggle on, but if you guys come those girl guides and Zortch don't have any cover for their approach to the ramp."
: So we probably like.
": Oh we're gonna, I think like Han Solo style we're just gonna have to be shooting from the ramp once we get there."
": Another issue too is that like, what you could also theoretically do is the ship needs to get started up and ready to go. So you could split up. You know like, in other words, it's gonna be helpful to have a pilot in the pilot chair by the time people are getting on that ramp."
": Question, do we have any kind of tractor thing or anything? If I just start shooting from up here and start a fight, could I get picked up by the ship?"
: With like a tractor?
": You guys don't have a tractor beam on the ship, but."
": I mean, I do have something that could."
": I mean, I could jump 30 feet."
: If you were within 90 feet.
Zac: I could give you my jet pack.
": Oh, dude!"
: And I could just run.
: Do you guys just wanna go to the ship and I'll just--
": Well, but you should be in the ship as quickly as possible."
"Z: Yeah, consider someone to fly me over there and I give Barry my jet pack for now."
: Yeah.
": Yeah, let's do it."
: Sweet.
: All right.
": You swap off, give your jet pack to Barry. Sid."
: This was Hog's. Treat it well.
Brennan: This was Hog's!
": Little Hog. Why don't you guys separate from me, then I'll go."
: Yeah.
": So everybody goes before me, I'll go last."
": Is there anything to me staying with you, though? Because I can buff you."
": If I have the jet pack. I mean, can you fly?"
: Yeah.
: Then...
": Well, I'm trying to get there quick as possible. So, I need someway to--"
: Who is gonna fly?
: I think Gunnie needs to be back anyway because Gunnie needs to start doing.
": Okay, so me and Sid can stay."
": I have ways to move us, too."
": How do you fly, is it the boots?"
": My boots, yeah."
": Can I put them on and then. Oh no, because you need that."
": Is it helpful to have one of the gunners in the gunner seat, though?"
": Oh, to be shooting from the gunner's seat."
"M: Yeah, why don't I just? I feel like with the jet pack and stuff and I have rage, like I'll take the least amount of damage."
": All right, cool. I was gonna try and cast--"
: Riva could also stay with you with the.
: With the drone.
: Yeah.
": Yeah, let's do that."
"B: So, Barry and Riva, you stay poised on the ledge. Yeah, Riva psycho-drone and Barry stays poised on the ledge. You've given your jetpack to Barry. Sid, you've got Skip. Gunnie, you've got Margaret."
"S: Wait, where is my body?"
": Oh no, you've got the body. Yeah, so I don't know how Margaret's moving."
": Margaret could just fully hide and get full cover and not be within range to get like, because they'll probably throw insane shit at me. So Margaret can just be somewhere where she can't get hit by like a grenade or something if they throw it up at me. So if you're up here, but when we leave, I can grab you, I can jet pack up. And you can also, if you have any kind of reactions or anything that you can help us with then I think that's a solid plan."
: I'm gonna cast energetic burst on Margaret just in case. add D4's to your saving throws.
"B: Gunnie, Riva, Sid, and Skip head to the ship. Give me a group stealth check."
: Under smuggle or no?
"E: Yeah, with smuggle. Smuggle's still going. I was gonna cast haste on what's his face, but."
": 29, 20."
: 18.
: 25.
"Brennan: 25, 29."
: 20.
": 20\. Okay, no noise. Just small, you guys have your thrusters dimmed all the way down to just like a tiny little iridescent blue."
A: Can I focus my critical analysis on Gunnie? And that's a 25 now.
"B: Hell yeah, you can do that. So."
": I'm gonna burn a hit dice if that's okay. Just to do like a short, just to get myself back up to full."
"B: Great. You. Your thrusters on your boots again are like, there's no orange to them. It's just low burn, iridescent blue, quiet. You're flying so slowly right now."
: That's gotta feel insane. That drop is wild.
"B: You move through this space. You make a stealth check. Gunnie with Riva's body and Sid and Skip. Do the smartest thing you can think to do which is instead of going out sideways at eye level, from that ledge you guys go straight up another 200 feet to the ceiling. Tall ceiling of the hangar. And where there's railings and pipes and all kinds of things, you move across the hangar slowly. And get to the last strip of lights on the far side of the hangar. This whole process takes a painstaking, sweat dripping down your nose, minutes. Hiding behind the row of blue lights alongside, literally just keeping a force shield to keep the cold vacuum of space out, you begin to drop down. And when you have total cover from the soldiers, only then do you guys drop down. And fly to a side port entrance. The passive perception of the Vercadian with that heightened stealth roll gets all of you to the ship. You are aboard the Wurst."
: What was the passive perception?
: I think it was 22.
": Oh, thank god. Thank god."
B: You are aboard the ship. You get aboard. Riva.
Siobhan: Yeah.
"Brennan: Your psycho-drone, you can even, active in your psycho-drone, you can feel Riva's body being deposited back into the water."
"R: Oo, my scales are so wrinkly from being out in the air."
"B: Skip, you're on the ship aboard. Now you can see, as you are here aboard the ship, you hear some finishing touches of the mods. There's like a lot of Acme Ashman people on board. You hear one of them down in the brig talking, being like,"
"Yeah, yeah, I get it. I understand that they're being detained, but we're happy to keep working."
"B: And you hear a UFTP person down below in the ship be like,"
"Obviously, yeah, the word from on high is that we're planning to release those prisoners at any time, so. Just you know, make sure that all the mods are to specification."
B: It sounds like some work is being completed on the ship. You hear off in the distance as well.
"Oh, three bars!"
: It sounded like auto tuned.
"B: Uh, Gnosis. You get in the ship. Riva, you're still in your psycho-drone. Gunnie, where are you moving to on the ship?"
"L: I think I am gonna go to this gunner station on the left, the side of the ship, so that I can keep an eye on what's going on in the hangar."
"B: Copy that. Sid, where? So, you're moving to the further gunner station."
": Oh well, you're here. Sorry, I forgot you were here. I guess I'll go downstairs and start preparing hyper drive."
": Start getting the hyper drive. Actually, if you wanna go on and start doing some FTL."
": No! Ugh. Oh, disadvantage. That's gonna be--"
"E: Oh, you have Handy Annie, though."
"L: Oh, great."
E: She's for you when we're doing ship battles.
L: That's a nat one.
: Oh boy.
"B: So you're just getting started on those. Sid, where do you go to?"
"E: Is there, I mean, is there a gunning station that I can shoot people in this room?"
"B: Yeah, there is."
E: Then that's where I'm going.
"B: You get to a gunning station up aboard the ship. We are now going to. So, Margaret, Barry, Riva."
"E: I also will, can I? I'm gonna drop our smuggle and we have new guns, right?"
B: You look and see brand new Atomotorch particle blasters installed with the collido-connect telescoping targeting system.
: So I will--
": Acme Ashman shields, the whole nine yards."
"E: We're all in, so I'm dropping smuggle and I'm gonna cast tactical advantage on myself so I have an extra action to be cooling down my guns."
B: Amazing. Copy that.
: How close are the girl guides and? Have they moved closer?
"B: Yeah, as you guys log back into your ship's comms you get a thing from Zortch saying,"
Zortch: I can make a run for it whenever I need to.
"B: Sid, as you get into the gunner's station you see your little comms thing on the gunner channel has a message. In like a message thing for you."
"E: Oh, I'll listen. This is probably not the right time, but I'm curious."
(beeping)
"B: Auma's face appears. And looks, crying, and says,"
"Auma: I'm sending this to you. This is a prerecorded because I wanted you to know. Number one, they assured me they had no intention of harming you at all. And number two, if you're getting this, I want it on the record, prerecorded, that I think you're watching this having already gotten the hell outta there. And I wanted you to know that I was betting on that, without needing proof of it. Because you can do anything. And I know you don't have to like what I did, but I hope, I hope I can make it all worth it."
"E: I know she can't hear this back, but I say,"
"Sid: Ugh, maybe bargain for my safety but you put all my friends at risk. So, I still feel pretty frickin peeved at you."
(chuckling)
Sid: But I also know that you're a millionaire and I'm hoping that we can reconcile and build an amazing company together. But right now I'm really peeved and I know you can't hear and that's why I'm speaking so candidly!
E: And I punch the screen.
: Amazing.
": I'm the gunner channel, uh, what?"
"Sid: Whoa! Nothing I wouldn't, sorry."
: Is everything okay? Is there someone in there?
"Sid: All that talk of Shawna's community theater, I felt like practicing a monologue."
"B: Barry, Margaret, Riva, what's up?"
: Oh boy.
: Marge you wanna separate so you don't get shot if we get hit?
"A: Yeah, I'm gonna walk back a little bit. Or maybe like duck down here. Anywhere where I can get complete cover. I'm just like--"
"Brennan: Cool, you just go fully back on the ledge, hell yeah."
"Ally: Great, great."
": May I also, in my gunner channel, in the gunner pad, can I pop a moon roof so I could hypothetically throw a grenade if they're in a good range."
": Yeah, I'll allow that, for sure, yeah."
: Can I do one more?
: Yeah.
": As you do that, I've been working on the ship a little bit. Just because I know we're not gonna have to move as much, I'm gonna reroute power to the weapons system so they will deal double damage at this time."
": Oh my god. Okay, Riva, yes."
: Can I grab a couple of grenades from Margaret?
: Sure.
": And I'm like, we need a distraction, right? We need them to be focusing somewhere else, rather than us. Are there people below us? There were people below us before."
": Yeah, there's a ton of people below you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure."
: Will it get far enough with your throw? Or will it just go straight under us and then they'll look up from where the.
"Z: Here's my plan. I jump off where we are, I shoot my rocket boots. I bonus action, go into my body. As I drop the grenades drop."
(laughing)
Seems like a big distraction.
: That's pretty rad. I guess I'll hold my reaction to see if.
: I'll tell the Princeps.
": You can only do one grenade, because it's an action to throw a grenade."
Z: I'm just gonna drop it.
": Or you're just pulling pins on them, or yeah."
"Z: I mean essentially, my plan is I will go unconscious halfway through my fall. They will just roll out of my hands as I hit the floor."
": And I will watch Riva. And if this pulls away, if this gives cover to the Princeps and the girl guides, then I will just stay hidden and let this work. If I see that they look like they're in danger, I'll start shooting at people that would be looking at them. I'm just looking straight where the guides are."
: Hell yeah.
": I'm in the pilot seat. I relay to the Princeps, like, as you soon as you hear shit go down, climb aboard."
": Oh my god, he's so cool now."
: Incredible.
: He's seen the world.
"B: So, Riva, your courageous psycho-drone steps out, fires two rockets straight down and falls spinning through the air as you, wha, appear back aboard the ship. And your psycho-drone falls and woom. Boom! Explodes, huge explosion, everybody roll initiative."
Emily: Six.
"B: Okay, just raise your hand if had an above an 11. Cool, Margaret, Skipper, and Gunnie are gonna go before bad guys. Everyone else goes after bad guys. What are we doing as this begins? Skip, you just relayed the message. Zortch says, got it, we're running."
"Z: Turning the ship on. Getting ready to possibly exit, making moves with the ship. I would like to, once they're fully on the ship, possibly do something. But it seems like that will take a couple."
"B: Hell yeah. On your turn, Zortch, the girl guides and Zortch holding the holo-fract of Gnosis sprint halfway, so."
: Can Aurora help them?
": Yeah, I was gonna send Aurora to."
"B: Oh, I'll say. Yeah, in that case, Zortch is riding Aurora Nebbins with Gnosis, ha! And the girl guides start sprinting. You see Stax has a huge cigar in her mouth with this big bundles of credits and says,"
"Stax: Scram, everybody! We're getting the hell outta here!"
B: And just makes for the ship.
: You took physical credits?
"Stax: Yeah, I like 'em physical! I want cold hard cash on a barrel head."
"B: And that's, okay, Margaret and Gunnie."
"L: Great, I'm gonna, just because we're really getting buck nasty, I'm gonna weapon enhance Sid's gun as well. So that's a one plus to attack rolls and an extra D4 of fuck it, lightning damage."
: Woo!
: Nice.
"L: And then I will, that like juiced up, I'm gonna start doing calculations."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
"L: With Handy Annie. That is a 14, 24."
"B: Hell yes, that is three completed equations."
: Woo!
"B: Amazing, Margaret, from you."
A: I guess since we're getting buck nasty. I'm actually gonna hold my.
"B: Hold you initiative, great."
"A: Yeah, I'm just completely hidden. But I would love to just kind of like, glance down at my phone like, do I have any messages, or like?"
B: You check your messages and see nothing.
"A: Yeah, I was kind of like. Though the phone was probably off for like a long time."
"B: Incredible. As you, so Margaret you hold your turn. All UFTP looks over. They're gonna make a perception check. I'm gonna need new stealth checks from Margaret and Barry."
": Do we have advantage? Because I'm fully, like, covered. I'm fully, like."
": Oh yeah, you're fully."
": Yeah, I think we're fully covered. And actually, I'm just waiting to see if anybody attacks, tries to attack the girl guides or Zortch."
"B: Okay, this round. I'm gonna roll a luck check. You just don't want a one or a two. Yeah, everyone looks at this wild explosion. For TaleSpire crew, all of our UFTP people orient. UFTP people orient themselves towards the explosion that's gone off. Weapons fire, everyone says. Under attack! Under attack! The prisoners have escaped! The Vercadian takes off and moves."
: Where is the Vercadian?
B: The Vercadian's over in the crow's nest. The Vercadian takes off in flight and begins to move down the catwalk this way.
"Prisoners, return your cells and you will come to no harm."
Ally: So scared.
"B: That is going to be post initiative. So Margaret, you're gonna join the rest of your crew. But Barry and Riva and Sid, that's gonna be."
"S: Now Brennan, we're in a space station."
"Brennan: Yes, that's correct."
"S: So, we're in space?"
B: Sure.
S: And I'm on the ship?
: Yeah.
S: So I have improved grade to space casting now that I'm back on the ship?
"B: Yeah, that's for sure, yeah."
"S: That's correct? Great, so I will cast calm emotions."
B: Cool.
"S: So, normally that's a 20 foot radius. Now it's a 200 foot radius."
: Oh god.
"S: Anywhere within 6.000 feet of me, technically."
E: What are the details of that? Because you might wanna do it after I attack. If seeing a friend get attacked undoes it.
"S: Well, I can. Where are you going to attack? Because I feel like you wanna--"
E: I think I'm just gonna go right for the Vercadian protector droid.
": Great, so."
"E: Because there might be something like, if they see a friend get hit then they become hostile again."
": Oh my god, that's 100?"
S: You can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile towards--
: Riva.
: This ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a power or if it witnesses--
B: Did you say 200 foot radius?
S: Yes.
B: You're gonna hit absolutely everybody.
"S: Great, I'll just hit absolutely everybody."
B: Unbelievable. Okay.
"S: And maybe we get the Vercadian protector droid in that. The droids are organic, right, so."
"B: They are. They do have legendary resistance. So, Riva, you hit this enormous. So you're aboard the ship. You send your psychic energy through the ship. I'm gonna roll. How many saves is that? Unbelievably bad saves."
S: Great.
B: A tremendous. What is the image that this UFTP soldiers get as your psychic waves wash over them?
"S: Just like, less of an image and more of just a feeling of like lovey-dovey friendship."
: Incredible.
"S: And they just like, they're there, and they see their friends and they're like, what are we doing?"
": Ha, ha, ha."
(whooshing)
I always thought it would be fun to open a repair store. Just a place where you could repair small sort of hand held devices. I just like to fix things. You see.
": I mean, that sounds great."
B: The Vercadian legendary resists and orients towards the ship.
: Okay. Okay.
Emily: Is everyone cool if I attack the Vercadian?
Lou: Yeah!
Emily: Then I'm gonna turn my gun on to the Vercadian droid.
"B: You turn the ship's weapon unto the Vercadian droid? Okay, go ahead and do what you wanna do."
"E: I'm just going to, I don't know what like, it's new properties are, but. I just crit."
Brennan: No fucking way!
: Oh my god.
: Quadruple?
"E: I'm gonna add a kinetic die to that, for sure."
": And like, lightning damage?"
: So the wording is double damage. It doubles damage. Doubles damage.
": So I do 2D6 already. So then it's four, so it becomes eight."
: So she's gonna roll damage and then we just double that?
: I think we just roll. What is the exact wording?
: Weapons deal double damage. Period.
: We're gonna multiply whatever your roll by two.
": Okay, so I crit, so."
": And then you get 2D4 from me. And it's, yeah."
: But then that becomes...
: 4D4.
": Well it's only, excuse me, it's 1D4 from me that's now 2D4."
": Okay, 4D4. Here's my thing. Can I get an extra 2D6 from you? Don't give me the metal one. (laughing) The metal ones are terrible. This is why you roll poorly, Murph, you use the metal one."
(laughing)
: He was rolling poorly before he ever bought a pair of metal dice.
": So then, yeah. And then, this is like magnified, right? Because it's for."
: Because that's gonna multiply everything by two. So roll your crit dice. All of your dice are double. So you're rolling--
: Re-roll the ones.
: Re-roll the ones.
": Yup, that's also the new thing."
": Wait, if I roll one again?"
": Yes, that keeps."
": These are fucking merciless. Okay, so five, take it. Six. Four. And that's cocked. Four. Six."
: Oh my god.
": I haven't rolled the D4s yet. Two, one, okay."
: You can re-roll the two and the one.
": Oh, you're right!"
: Oh my gosh.
": Okay. Okay, plus six. So it's 28 damage. And then times two."
: 56.
": 56 damage, but isn't it amplified because it's a spaceship?"
: Ship to ground is a multiplier of times 10.
: So I do 560?
: 560 damage!
: Is that the record? Is that the D20 record?
"B: That is the Dimension 20 record. It's not only the Dimension 20 record, it is the largest sum total of damage from a single attack I have seen in 23 years of playing this game. In a single hit. So, Sid."
": So you doubled and you crit, and it's on a ship."
: I wanna understand but I don't!
"B: This Vercadian, whoop! (gurgling) Throwing up shields. (lasers firing) Is tattered, ribbons."
: I want his face to like fly up against the thing so I can kiss it.
Lou: That's sick.
": Wow, a real addition to slap kiss."
": Yeah, a real addition to slap kiss."
: Waste away kiss.
: 500 and 60 points!
: Can we make like an intimidation check on that?
": Yeah! This feels very sheriff's head on a cactus to me, Brennan."
"B: It feels pretty sheriff's head. Let's do it. Yeah, give me an intimidation with advantage. Go ahead and roll intimidation with advantage."
: A two and a seven.
(chuckling)
: Let's say I just pissed them off.
": It kind of does the reverse. Instead of cowing them, all of them go, ah! And start firing wildly."
: I actually get a bonus action to attack again.
Brennan: Go for it.
: Is there another Vercadian protector droid?
": Nope, I just had the one."
(chuckling)
: Then.
: Just blow up like a dude.
": Yeah, so I guess like who is closest to our friends?"
": Those are all workers, right?"
: You can actually just start.
": Oh, those are workers."
: You can truly just start like laying down suppressive fire.
": Okay wait, what if I use my bonus action to do like a fireworks show? To try and like persuade people that."
: That actually it was good. And to stop shooting. You could roll for that.
: The Vercadian protector droid just exploded.
: Hologram a mission accomplished sign across the ship.
": Okay, yeah. I just wanna see like who, so they're all going at us. So I like feel bad going after these workers though."
": Yeah, let's just get outta here. Just run away."
": Okay, so I won't bonus action attack."
Brennan: Okay.
: That was so brutal.
: You could actually just use an attack to like start laying down fire in front of these guys.
": Yeah, can I almost make a wall of fire protecting Aurora Nebbins and the people coming on?"
": Yes, absolutely."
": So, that's what I do with it."
"B: You just start laying down suppressive fire. Incredible. Any other actions from people? Like Barry and Margaret, what are you guys doing as this wall?"
: I guess I'll wait until they're flying a little bit over head and then I'll just shoot straight up? Does that?
: Holding me?
: Can we go above you? I don't know if that. How high up is this?
: You could grab Margaret and start.
: And I just start going straight up.
"B: Start going straight up, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you grab Margaret. You take off. Go ahead and give me a straight stealth check, the two of you. We'll make it a group stealth check. So we'll take the higher of the two rolls."
": Okay, okay."
: Natural 20.
Brennan: You've got to be kidding!
(players cheering)
"Brennan: Forget it, forget it. You did all the things right. You did all the stealth. Barry, you grab Margaret and. (whooshing) And as (imitates gunfire) this wall of fire. The Vercadian is already gone. These soldiers start to dive for cover as fast as they can. Even if they deal hundreds of points of damage to the ship, they are not gonna deal more than 800 which is the shield total of your ship. So even if they start firing on the ship, Barry is a fucking ghost in the rafters with Margaret in your arms. You take off. The drone is gone, Barry, you hit the top of the ship. Aurora Nebbins and the girl guides and the JibJobbers with Gnosis in Zortch rush up the ramp. Suppressing fire comes down. You drop in. Skip, as the engines go and the completed equations hit, Barry jumps in through an opening in the top of the bridge."
: Are you getting this on your phone?
: With Margaret.
Emily: Handy Annie is getting all of this.
Ally: Incredible.
"Brennan: The ramp closes and more importantly as the ship prepares to go through the force shield, all the UFTP people say, uh, that's gonna be an airlock on the ship. It's exiting to space. And they start hitting airlocks as this hangar is about to drop force shields for you to make a departure. And..."
Zac: Sayonara.
"Brennan: The Wurst, boom. Zooms forward having escaped the hangar with Gnosis on board."
: Whoa!
"Brennan: Zortch rushes to the bridge with Aurora Nebbins and says,"
Zortch: I'm sorry I let the girl guides gamble with the holo-fract. They just seemed really sure.
": Hey, I get it."
": Well, they were correct."
"Gunnie: Ball's rolling up, you wanna double down, I get it."
: They got a lot of money and some of that money is ours because they did gamble with our collateral.
R: And they're minors.
: Are you okay?
"Brennan: Zortch says,"
"Yeah, I'm fine. What happened?"
": Well, we were arrested."
"Zortch: You were arrested! Oh that's right, you were arrested. That's wild! Were they looking for us?"
": Yeah, yeah, how did you know to escape? How did you know to hide?"
: I wasn't hiding. We just went to the betting track.
: You just happened to leave the ship?
": Yeah, the girl guides, we just happened to leave the ship. They just grabbed Gnosis and sort of left the ship."
: All right.
(laughing)
"B: As you're standing there, the girl guide you see, Chloe takes a cigar out and just."
"Chloe: Uh, did it save your ass that we took the holo-fract?"
A: I take the cigar out of her hand.
: Why though?
"Margaret: No, we're not doing this."
A: I break it in half like a good mom.
Margaret: That's very lucky. And sometimes things are lucky and sometimes they're not. And we're happy for you that this time was lucky.
: We'll just take the two million.
"B: You see that as the holo-fract, or sorry, as you say, some things are lucky and some aren't. You see there's a little gift wrapped thing on the coffee table. You see it says, from Lucienne, after your release."
A: I open it.
"B: It's a little poster and there's a little post-it on it that says, for your office. And you see it is an image of a silhouette of a figure pushing a boulder up a hill. Giving a little thumbs up. With the words, “hang in there” underneath it."
Margaret: She's so fucking funny. (laughing) She's so funny and cool and funny.
A: I rush right into my office to go pick a place to put it.
": Wait, can I use telemetry to make sure there isn't any kind of tracking device on this post-it."
": Yes, you do a scan for it."
: Or anywhere on the ship.
B: The ship bursts out of Myrmidon Station. You have your completed equations. Where are you setting course to?
: Rubian Five.
"B: Rubian Five. You- (whooshing) As you are moving through faster than light space, Aurora looks excited. Zortch is there with the holo-fract. You've escaped. You know what's happened. Gnosis is ready to enact this plan from the Fang of Frangus. The only bit of a bummer is of course like some power cells and other like ancillary equipment left behind. And you won't have an opportunity to shop prior to emerging from faster than light in hyper space."
: Okay.
"B: As you are on the bridge gathered there, getting ready for whatever awaits for you when you drop out of faster than light, in the streaming wormhole of tachyon travel, knowing that you're out of equipment. Knowing that you don't have the ability to shop, you see something spiraling through the tachyon fields. Little spinning, a spinning, rusty hovel. Plugs Butt Ugly Stuff Hut."
(players cheering)
: What?
": Plug, is that you?"
"P: I told ya. I told ya. I said, the first thing I said when we met, when you most need me I will appear in my hut."
": Plug, did you make up the gambling?"
P: What's that?
: Did you tell the girl guides about the big gamble?
"P: Ha, ha, you tell me."
B: And he holds up a little miniature of a horse.
: I check it to see if it's real.
"B: All of this over the comm screen. He says,"
"Plug: There's something I forgot to mention. I got my stuff hut when I was a younger man, for a song, because it was sort of rusty old hunk of junk escape pod. Mind if I hitch a ride?"
B: And you see the Stuff Hut hitches unto the escape pod docking.
": It's incredibly dangerous to do all of this while in faster than light travel. But I love you, Plug."
: He's an incredible pilot.
"B: Plug says,"
"Plug: Hey, you don't have to worry about danger if you know you're gonna die tomorrow."
: You guys.
": Well, this shop's open for business. And he flakes, wings that open."
: We get all the JibJobbers in there for a little tour.
: For a little tour.
"Well, JibJobbers, Plug's Butt Ugly Stuff Hut. It's full of stuff, but it's all butt ugly."
"B: And he attaches, starts throwing a bunch of gear to you. You come out of faster than light travel. (whooshing) Outside Rubian Five. As you emerge from faster than light travel in orbit over the moon of this gas giant, you are perhaps surprised to find a fleet of Amercadian Space Brigade ships with their guns trained on you. A fleet of United Free Trade Planets ships with their guns trained on you. A fleet of Rubian Five Royal Guard ships with their guns--"
": Oh, are they trained on us? Are they trained on us?"
: Trained on you.
": Oh, okay."
": A fleet of Griivarr World vessels, with their guns trained on you."
": That's gotta be it, right?"
: It was another hot dog. It was a completely different--
: A small fleet of Repo Reaper vessels.
": What, no!"
"Brennan: With their guns trained on you. Floating in space, a squadron of Living Doll Cybernetics Warfare Whitney's."
: What?
: With their guns.
All: Trained on you.
(chuckling)
": Done, are you done?"
": What else is trained on us, huh?"
": Yeah, is the Artist Collective there? Do they have their guns?"
"Ally: Oh my god, don't do this to us. We actually have to fight."
Lou: With their paint brushes trained on us?
"Siobhan: What about if their guns are trained on everyone else, because it's so random, huh."
": Yeah, how about that?"
: Maybe the most random thing.
Brennan: Gust Weatherall.
(groaning)
Surrender
Surrender
surrender the ship.
Surrender the ship
surrender. And you'll be allowed to survive.
Brennan: I'm gonna need everybody here to roll initiative.
: Oh my god.
: Just roll initiative.
"Brennan: That's all for this week on ""Dimension 20."" Tune in next week for the battle on Rubian Five. See you in the stars."
Siobhan: What?
Zac: Fuck.
Lou: Fuck.
"Siobhan: Now, did we get a long rest?"

"Brennan: As Skip hits the engine, boom! Gunnie, down below decks. Bam, hits the thing. Shields lower, you guys feel the energy leaving your Atomotorch Particle Blasters. And you hear a rumbling and shaking. You guys can hear chips falling in the casino. The engines have never burned this hot."

(upbeat music)
"B: Hello one and all! Welcome back to another thrilling episode of Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey. I'm your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan and with me as always are our intrepid heroes. Say hi, intrepid heroes."
"All: Hi, intrepid heroes!"
"B: Naruto running as fast as they can straight into the waiting clutches of their enemies. Last we left off, we found our intrepid heroes here in orbit around Rubian V, the moon of the gas giant Rubian. Here in a cluttered asteroid belt of space junk surrounding the moon, we now find ourselves not too far away from Madrugada station, which you can see out there towards the end of the asteroid field, but that is not what is interesting to you. Hidden within the asteroid field ahead of you, you see a strange alien satellite concocted by the designs of the Cerebro-Slugs of the house of Frangus in ages long past: the Fang of Frangus!"
Z: Father!
(all laugh)
"Brennan: You'll notice awaiting you here are a vast array of factions all gathered at this point, having anticipated your arrival in this place. Closest to the Fang of Frangus, not altogether that surprising, is a core squadron of United Free Trade Planets' vessels, a squadron of UFTP fighters around a central command ship positioned just outside of the asteroid belt. Also closing in around them are a squadrant of Repo-Reaper vessels, X and very small, if you zoom in way, way, way small, do you guys see the squadrons of Warfare Whitneys flying through space towards you?"
": God, no."
": Oh my god, they're so small."
: I'm gonna fucking jump out and fight them in the air.
(Brennan laughs)
: Fight me in space!
: Fight me in space.
Brennan: Fight me in space.
Z: I'm just gonna ram 'em.
(Emily laughs)
"Brennan: At your six o'clock and at your three o'clock are two enormous Amercadian command ships with an entire squadron, you know back in New Texas, a small handful of Brigade Tigers almost took you out of the sky, you are facing down two Amercadian command ships and 20 Brigade tigers."
"Ally: It's a little overpowered, you know what I mean?"
": What's that? Oh, maybe, you know, but hey."
"A: It's like, okay, Amercadia what are you trying to prove?"
"B: And then to your left, you'll also see, having just come out of FTL, is a massive sort of fun and friendly looking Griivarr World command vessel, this giant-"
": Very soft, soft edges."
: Soft edges.
: It's not sharp.
: Imagineered.
B: These are the factions that now surround you. All of your adventures here in the galaxy since that bad job where you got some wrong intel and got a crate full of rotten powdered imitation egg substitute-
: And our best friend.
"B: And your best friend Skip, your wonderful best friend, Skip, you all started to find that the ball was rolling up hill. You got your hands on not only a new captain, pilot, but a new business manager, owner, Margaret Encino, who left her high paying job at UFTP to come and whip this business into shape, and this crew of proldiers-"
"S: O, captain, my captain."
": O, captain, my captain."
: I'm so proud.
"B: But now of course, you are not just the crew of a proldier vessel, you are all the owners of the Wurst. You have gathered here together at the Fang of Frangus with the Princeps Zortch, who after all is your chef for your ship."
: Princhef.
"Brennan: With Gnosis, a holofract supercomputer, a living synthetic cybernetic deity and your friend who has a plan to forestall the coming violence on Rubian V to somehow save that planet and its people from certain doom, whether at the nonstop you know hollowing out of their planet by United Free Trade Planets, or by the eruption of a god slug from the planet in the Great Emhatchening. A lot of stuff going on here, but the point is this, you are a union ship. You have Acme-Ashmun Force shields, top of the line, atomo-torch particle blasters, you got a 1.2 million credit fight purse, you are sponsored, you are union. You have a crew, a casino and Plug's Butt Ugly Stuff Hut slapped on the back of your vessel. There it is. The ball is rolling up and you've just come outta faster than light. We enter initiative and every single enemy faction readies actions."
S: Battle stations.
: What is battle-
"S: Battle stations, we can't be surprised and we are not, did we come into this surprised?"
B: You did come into this surprised.
"S: No we didn't, and I expend a power die and… Zac, Lou, and the two gunners can act normally."
They're here!
: It's good to fight alongside a psychic.
"B: Incredible, yeah. As you guys are leaving faster than light Riva starts to react before you see anything, 'cause."
": What's going on, what's going, what do you see?"
": I feel it in the air, the portents."
": And I, and when I roll initiative, could I, I can roll, move forward."
": Before you roll initiative, that's absolutely correct."
: Okay I just really need quickly to bring up.
: Six.
: Six.
": Margaret, like, could, we have the proof that UFTP"
: Yeah we do. ...is working against Griivarr.
": Yeah, we do."
: Should we send it to Griivarr?
: Yeah we should.
: And try to turn them against UFTP?
Zac: Yeah let's get everyone mad at each other.
: We have Handy Annie's recording of the complete confession of it.
: Yeah.
": Okay. So what's gonna happen is this, as you come out, what is your movement as you begin to inch forward?"
": Got it, I guess I just keep going forward, right? Like I'm trying to think of what route to take, maybe like towards the Warfare Whitneys?"
"Brennan: Yeah, I can dig it."
"Zac: I rolled a six, so that means six times 50."
: So 300 feet?
: 300 feet forward.
"Brennan: So the Wurst is gonna move Warfare Whitneys in space. As you're looking at the bridge, Zortch on the bridge with Margaret, Riva, and Skip looks out and goes, ''This is the, this is the bad place. Riva you warned me not to come to this place.'' Zortch goes, ''Oh God, what? This is where the slugs are gonna-'' And Zortch like says, ''Should I hide? What should I do?''"
: Keep making eggs.
: Okay.
: That's your job.
: All right I'm gonna go.
": I put my arm around Zortch, I go, ''Look a little bit of a mix up. What you're doing will look identical to the bad thing, but it's actually gonna be the good thing.''"
: What?
": Yes, it's crazy. It's complicated."
": As long as you're working, as long as you're doing what you want to do on the satellite, everything's fine. If you're not doing what you wanna do-"
: We're gonna make sure-
: On satellite.
: You get-
: Nothing is fine.
: Yes.
: Does anyone have a way to protect them from a brain slug?
": I take, hey, this is me on the gunner channel."
: Hey.
: A plastic bag.
": No, no."
: Let's put a helmet on them.
: I'm gonna go put a space helmet on.
Emily: Put a space helmet on.
: I'm gonna put a space helmet on.
: Don't let them get in your nose!
: Can I explain to them?
: Take off your Breathe Right you want closed nostrils.
": Yeah, don't breathe. Can I explain to them the idea of like you, someone wants to slug you, as long as you're not slugged you're not doing the evil thing. We're gonna make sure that doesn't like, and then explain who they're looking out for. Like they don't wanna be around Big Barry Nyne."
": They're like, okay, all right, I'm gonna go to the kitchen. I'm gonna make some eggs. I'm gonna look out for Big Barry Nyne and we'll be good to go."
: And I'm wearing my hair in a ponytail right now.
: I was just gonna say the same thing.
: Okay? Remember that.
": So if you see a Barry and he says do this, but he's not, doesn't have a ponytail, you don't listen to that Barry."
: I only listen to you when you have a ponytail.
": Right unless we get the slug out of Barry Nyne, then he's our best friend again. But I will tell him to put a ponytail on, so always ponytail Barry, trust ponytail Barry."
: Always ponytail Barry.
: Always ponytail Barry.
: That's why we all have hair ties.
: That's why we all have hair ties alright everyone show your hair ties.
: I am also wearing a ponytail.
": I wrapped it around my whole head, just like."
": And I have psychic concealment, also I have had it going on-"
: On Zortch and Gnosis?
: On Zortch and Gnosis this whole time.
: Amazing.
: So. They're harder to find psychically.
: Zortch runs off into the ship to go find a space helmet.
: Plastic bag will do if you can't find that.
": Plug, you got any guns on your ship, ship guns?"
: Do I have guns?
: Can you shoot from the butt plug?
": I can, but it's not good."
": Plug, you are so special to us if you get scared, just leave. I just need to know that you're gonna be okay."
Siobhan: But you're not gonna gonna die today.
: You know what I'm gonna say.
: You're gonna die tomorrow.
": I'm gonna die tomorrow. That's right. By the way, who's this handsome gal in the casino?"
: Oh my god.
: That is Bambi LeRoux.
: Oh my God.
: Make sure you give her a smile.
Ally: And you need to go buy her a drink.
: You absolutely.
": All right, I'm gonna get, I'm gonna hitch my pants up another bell loop and I'm gonna-"
": Honestly, if we die and Plug gets laid..."
: That's fine.
: 100 6886384t was worth it.
: He was absolutely the protagonist.
: I think that evens out completely.
": It evens out completely, galaxy falls to ruin, but Plug got laid."
": I have to be honest, you just absolutely fed me."
: Incredible.
: You fed me.
: That is so insane.
": You can also see up on the bridge, just sort of in his sweater vest, holding a sort of little travel thermos of coffee, Raymond Zam looks over and goes, ''Oh boy aye yai yai.''"
": I have a question, there's so many people on, I'm saying this through the Intercom, Raymond, there's so many people with computers, is there any sort of hacking expertise from the Jib Jobbers that they could sort of run some sort of technical interface with their computers?"
": Well, normally that wouldn't be possible, but you guys upgraded to gold tier, so you cannot force the Jib Jobbers to work on behalf of the ship, 'cause they're obviously customers. But if you go into your gold tier profile on the app, you can offer a Rigon of free membership and if they elect to that, they'll temporarily be conscripted into the crew of the ship and they'll man weapon systems or they'll do whatever."
": Incredible, can I go down and talk to all of them? I'm not only opening up the thing, but I would like to try to convince them every one of them to help us."
": Absolutely, we are gonna be in initiative. So that's one of the things you can do with your turn if you wish."
: Cool.
": And you see Aurora Nebbins looks up at you, Sid, and goes (alien growling) and just curls up around your seat at the gunner station and tenses up almost like she wants to leap out into space."
": There is a moon roof, Aurora you gimme the sign and, and I can just send you out there, you can breathe in space, right? Eat a turtle if you can. (all laugh) Okay eat a turtle if you wanna go into space."
: All right.
: Turtles going...
": All right so, up on the bridge in the comm station, you guys rolled very low for your ship's initiative."
: We did.
": Got a nat one on ship's initiative, comm stations come up, Gust Weatherall's face comes up, Riva, at your comm station. Boom, and next to that is Damian Factor, your old boss, who both sort of start speaking at the same time. Gust Weatherall says, ''As an Admiral of the Amercadian Space Brigade, we hereby demand the immediate surrender of the traitor, Norman Takamori.''"
: Please hold.
Brennan: Our Amercadian Tigers are each going to take a full double move towards the Wurst. And you see
": Riva, popping up next to that, this is sort of a handsome looking sort of UFTP guy saying, ''Hi, do I have the comms officer of the Wurst?"
": That's correct, you do, thank you for calling the Wurst."
": Damien Factor with United Free Trade Planets, we are trying to get in touch with Margaret Encino, who we believe is the owner of the vessel. We need the immediate surrender of the Princeps Zortch, so if that can be made effective immediately, any movement on your ship is going to trigger us firing on your ship."
": Thank you so much for all of this information. We've heard so much about you, please hold."
": I don't wanna, oh, that UFTP squadron of fighters is gonna come flying in. They're gonna take a double move as well. They also have 400 feet of movement as they come in on the Wurst here. Comms comes in on the bridge once again, Riva, underneath as swarms of these Warfare Whitneys comes in, Hi there, sugar, could you patch us through to your gunner channel?"
: Absolutely not! Can I help you?
: We need the surrender of one rogue android on your ship. She's a bit of a copyright liability.
": Ah, thank you so much for asking, but actually I believe that you are the copyright culpability, please hold!"
": Boom, goes off."
: A switchboard.
: Yeah.
: Warfare Whitneys are gonna take a double move. So that's only gonna be 400 feet of movement for them.
: Their movement is 200 feet?
: Yeah.
: Wild.
": Yeah, they're fast."
": Gunner channel, just to be absolutely clear we are, the metaphorical word for it that you use I believe, is absolutely screwed. Just in case you were wondering, maybe were, maybe weren't"
": Well, we're nuts and bolts so we're all about getting screwed."
: Yeah.
: Isn't that right Sid?
: Yeah! I look at I've hung like a Vercadian protector droid calendar.
: They're all soaking wet.
": Well, I look at Veep 909, Yeah, I like getting screwed."
": Another screen opens up on the comms in front of you, Riva, you see like a scary looking dude in a weird dripping basement wearing sunglasses in this like dark room, goes, ''Do I have the comms officer of the Wurst?''"
": You do, you okay that room looks very drippy."
": You can just call me Doc. We're looking for Gunnie Miggles-Rashbax, we've gotten word from Repo-Reapers corporate that his account is actually about to be closed."
": Yes, I believe so."
: Great so we've put him on fire sale and let our agents know that we have a limited amount of time to collect on his contract before corporate closes on him.
": Oh, that sounds highly immoral, please hold."
: Ask how much it is.
": Oh yeah, how much is it?"
: 750.000 credits.
": Oh, that's exactly the same as it was before, please hold."
": Yeah, you basically see that they're like, if we can have corporate like make this deal at at the same time that we're collecting on this contract, we make double the money basically. Another screen opens up, you see this beautiful elegantly decorated alien monarch saying, ''At once connect me to my child, the Princeps Zortch.''"
: Is that your child or is that your body's child? Please hold.
"Brennan: Let's go ahead and move the Repo-Reaper faction, they're also gonna take a double move that's 700 feet directly for the Wurst. Both Amercadian command ships and the UFTP command ship are going to ready actions."
": All right, yeah."
": On the comm station, Riva, you see Uncle Bob shows up. Well, hey there, what's your name, friend?"
: I think you already know my name and I think you are lying.
": Well tough news, seems like you've got a piece of Griivarr world technology. As a proud spokesman and owner of Griivarr Enterprises, we'd love to get it off your hands. Would you be a pal and send it on over?"
: I don't see what being friend has to do with any of that. That doesn't seem like what it is at all. And actually how can you own something that is sentient? That doesn't seem right. Please hold.
"Brennan: Let's move those Griivarr fighters, and the Griivarr command ship is also going to ready an action. Lots of enormous command ships with readied actions, a bunch of fighters closing in on you. It is your turn."
": Skip, you wanna ram some wienies?"
": Okay I can, can we patch Gnosis into this conversation? Gnosis, are you wanting us to just outrun this situation and deposit you onto the Fang?"
Brennan: Is Gnosis plugged in or is there any?
": Gnosis is not plugged in right now, but I also worry that Barry Syx and the gang might already be on the Fang so just dropping-"
: I'm actually Barry Syx.
": Sorry, Barry Nyne, there's a lot going on."
: Barry slug.
": Yeah, Barry slug. Excuse me"
: Barry slug.
": So sorry, King Prilbus."
": Yeah, okay, so 100 percent King Prilbus-"
: Father.
": Yeah, your, Skip's dad."
: Father.
": Who? Yeah so I'm worried that King Prilbus, A.K.A Father, might be on the Fang already."
": My personal thought is outrun the big guys, ram the wienies."
: Great.
: Yeah.
: Sounds good.
": Cause we're not gonna be able to, they're faster than us, period."
: And the big guys won't follow us into the field.
: True!
: Asteroid field.
: So we can just go on the other side.
: Exactly.
: Yeah. Let's just get to the asteroids as fast as possible.
": I think I wanna pop my head out of the moon roof, and shout to the Whitneys, obviously they probably can't hear me as we get close to ram them, ramming them, I wanna at least say, ''Join us!''"
": We're gonna, I'm gonna reroute power to the engines. So our flying speed is doubled."
Brennan: Your flying speed goes to 600.
: Yes.
: Yeah.
": But we will now take, our shields will take double damage, and regenerate by half, and our weapons will do half damage."
: Our weapons do half damage?
: Half damage.
: Just for the turn?
": That's fine, because we, we can maybe be trying to do more. Yeah, that's fine."
": So 1200 puts us just a little in front of them, does anyone have anything to let us move forward at all?"
: I can boost engines.
": Yeah, maybe if we boost engines first, that will give us enough."
: Great.
": Come on, Riva."
"Murph: I was gonna say, can I do?"
": You can do a direct, yeah. You can give direct and give advantage."
: I'll do that.
": Oh wait, actually what we should do is I should direct and you should do it."
: All right we're gonna use that roll though.
": So, so I'll roll."
: With advantage 'cause Riva's helping you.
Siobhan: My thing.
": 16 plus three, yeah 19."
: Great.
": 19, all right. You boost engines, so that's so now it's 700. So you can move 1400."
: All right so that puts us just past the Warfare Whitneys and I would like to ram them.
": Hell yes, is anyone doing anything before Zac moves before Skip pilots forward for the ram?"
: Maybe we should boost shields.
: What do I do for boosting shields?
: Same DC 12 strength.
: Okay.
: With the ship.
: Nice.
: 15.
: Hell yeah.
: Roll a d8 and that's temp shield points right?
: Awesome.
: Cool.
: I was going to do-
: Seven.
Ally: Nice I was gonna do kind of like housekeeping-y trying to like go down to Jib Job and do that kind of stuff if that's cool with everyone.
: Yeah.
": Margaret, we'll do you in a second."
: Cool.
": So we've used action, action, action, action, and now we're doing ram. As you move those command ships have some readied actions here, hold on one second."
: Can I use Colonian Turn?
": It's a reaction, right?"
": Yeah to attempt to, I spend a power die and try to move out of the way of the attack, but I'm gonna move towards the Warfare Whitneys in the hopes that I can ram all of them."
": Hell yeah, man."
: Nice.
: Go for it.
": Five, so that's three, no 250 feet forward."
": Number one, you doing that literally I just measured it, moves you into long range for the Amercadian vessel right behind you."
: Yeah!
": So you hit the guns and you hear Gust Weatherall over the comms go, ''Goddamn it, Takamori, when are you gonna learn?'' And he's gonna take an attack, disadvantaged, does a 12 hit the newly plated Wurst?"
: It does not.
: It does not.
": Boom, assault laser. By the way this laser coming in is six d6 plus four damage from a command ship assault laser, glances over your shields. That's a miss from the second Amercadian. This one's coming from the UFTP command ship. Also a miss."
: Yes.
: Wow.
": And here's Uncle Bob with the Griivarr Worlds, Unbelievable a fourth miss."
: Yes!
: Yes!
"Brennan: As Skip hits the engine, Gunnie down below deck, bam, hits the thing shields lower. You guys feel the energy leaving your atomo-torch particle blasters, and you hear a rumbling and shaking, you guys can hear chips falling in the casino. The engines have never burned this hot."
: The chips!
": Hold on, Bambi!"
": You see Bambi goes, ''Oh!'' and goes off her seat, and Plug catches her in a dip and says, ''Well I'll say you don't seem to have your sea legs yet, lil lady.''"
: Oh my god!
": Oh, well you give me a smile, mister. A real cowboy."
": There you go Plug, there you go!"
: One of my things right now as Operator is as a bonus action I can learn certain information about the capabilities of a target of ours.
: Hell yeah.
: Can you tell me the armor class and current hull points of one of the big Amercadians just to have an idea of what this is?
"Brennan: Hell yes, hold on one second. I'm gonna give that to you, hold on a second."
: It's gonna be quite scary.
: The AC is five million.
": Yeah, yeah, I mean do we wanna know? I know we're gonna run, but it's a bonus action."
": Margaret, this is a very fun move, I'm gonna tell you why, the command ships each have an armor class of 11, very easy to hit they're enormous they're quite large. But the other thing you discover is that they though look identical, the hull points and shield points of the ship to your right are way lower than the one behind you, as you look out you're reading on your screen in front of you, you're like shields for the Amercadian command ship to your right way down, hull points way down, that ship has sustained damage, even though it doesn't look like it."
: And that's definitely not the one that Gust Weatherall is in right?
: Yeah Gust is in the-
: In the nice one.
": Gust is in the, you think Gust is in the one behind you. Like just the attitude of him talking is like bearing down on you, something weird's going on. You guys have the rest of your turn, I would advise you to squeeze every last drop out of it. 'cause this next turn's gonna suck."
: Yeah my action I would love to go down to a Jib Job and gather everyone around. I'm sure they know something's going on. 'cause the whole thing is shaking and let them know about the incredible new promotion that we have going on.
: Cool.
: It's in app.
": Cool so you just like grabbed your phone and jump down, you can do everything you need to do as an operator from your phone."
": Yeah, yeah, yeah."
": Cool, so you jump down to Jib Job and that was a bonus action, this is your action, right?"
: Yeah this is my actual action.
": Cool, amazing, so you see yeah the Jib Jobbers look up as you approach, what do you say to them?"
": I'm just like, we have an incredible promotion right now we love all of you on this ship and we wanna offer you all, some free Jib Job time, this is a family. We're all working together as one unit. If you look out the window, there's a chance we might all die. We'd love you to, we'd love for your help. And then I wanna make groups of people and give them an order for each pod to work on."
": You see that Raymond sends the gold tier thing over to your profile. Everyone logs in, give me a persuasion check. I'll say for every point above 10 that's how many Jib Jobber you get to a max of all 13 at 23."
": Okay, nat one, okay."
": Brutal, oh no."
": My heart, oh god."
": Okay, uh, wow that's wild."
": It's okay Margaret, you have a lot going on."
": Yeah, yeah I've got a lot going on. Okay I fake, I just have to pee really bad, I'm so sorry I'll be right back. I run to the bathroom. I'm gonna come back next turn and double the amount of free Jib Job time that we have."
: Incredible.
: Like we're cooking.
: Am I able to open a communication or have I already used my communication?
": Yeah you can open it, you have an action. Any if you guys have bonus action stuff, you can do go for it, go for it."
": I mean, I don't know if you would let it count as a bonus action, but can I open an open channel to everybody that makes it seem like I pressed the button incorrectly?"
: Sure absolutely.
": And just say to Margaret, what did you say about that Amercadian vessel on the right not having any armor or shield or hit points. That seems crazy."
": Yeah, yeah."
: I wonder if anybody else knows about that.
": Yeah, definitely."
Brennan: And is that just broadcasting?
: That's just broadcasting to everybody.
": Everybody okay, cool copy that. So that's your action, is there anything, any other bonus actions, anything else people are doing this turn?"
": I'm gonna do a thing just for like a mechanic thing, I'm gonna overload their weapons, but mostly just for the creative thinking ability."
: Gotcha.
": A d8 twice, I just want an eight, I got an eight awesome. That just means the next turn my dice is a d10."
: Amazing.
: I mean-
: Wait so it was any point over how much was it?
: Over 10.
: Over 10 okay.
: Can't get a brain blast.
: That's a one. Can I defiant to at least get a couple people working?
": Sure, absolutely. Yeah yeah."
: Actually why not I'll go into the zone.
: Hell yeah you went into the zone.
: Three okay.
": Three. So four you have four people that go like, oh, I'll take a free ride home."
": Great and for the rest of you, I'll be right back. But for those people, can I of them reach out to the union and let them know that we are severely under attack?"
Murph: Oh that's great.
": You see, Raymond actually looks over and says, ''I'm happy to do that. are you okay with me using the ship's login?''"
: I'm so okay
": once again, I have to pee, so that's why I'm being so weird, but you...I would love it if you would do that, I give him all like the login stuff that he needs for like my ship email."
": You see Raymond goes, okay gotcha, takes his little thermos and goes, speech to text. Hi, this is Raymond Zam on behalf of Margaret Encino, we're aboard the Wurst right now, just calling to union headquarters to let you know that we are surrounded by a number of aggressive, hostile ships, engaged in active combat, and we would absolutely love your help at the nearest convenience. Thanks so much, Raymond Zam, mobile number, and just starts."
: We love.
: Incredible.
": I look at him, and I go, ''You're consistent and that's one of the most beautiful things out of being a human and being alive.''"
": You know, it doesn't take, it's a wild galaxy. You don't need to make it anymore wild."
": Slap, mwah. (all laugh)"
: All right so let's resolve this ram.
: All right so the ram is a ram check versus the target's maneuverings.
": Towards their dex okay, copy that."
: So we have a plus six to this. Dirty 20.
: That is a success.
: Okay and can I just ram through all of them?
": So on an attack run, you can either do an extra plus three damage or have them become stunned until the end of their next turn."
: That's great we could just outrun them.
": They don't have any save, they don't have any save to?"
": No, if you win the contest, you can just, you can do normal ram damage and choose to have them be stunned."
": Okay, let's do that."
": Yeah, let's do that. So my ram damage is equal to two of your ship's hull die plus your ship's strength modifiers. So this is two d8 plus three."
: Two d8 plus three.
": And if we have a shield points remaining our ship takes half of this damage, 'cause otherwise."
Emily: I have seven temporary hits.
": Five and a two plus three, so 10 damage."
: So that first Warfare Whitney's gonna take undergo the stunned condition.
: So am I only hitting the first one or?
Brennan: You're only hitting the first one.
: Couldn't just push through?
": So you have movement and they can't get an attack of opportunity on you, but you cannot take multiple rams against multiple ships without using multiple actions."
: Got it.
: Okay.
: How much damage do we take from what we just did?
: We take a full ten.
: But our shields normally take half damage so we take five.
": Half, half, half."
": Double. So it's half, half double so it's half."
"Emily: Half, so we still have two, then we still have two temporary."
: Great.
": Great. And I am gonna use my bonus action to enhance scope. So you guys, the next one of your attacks has plus 500 to its range. and then you roll this d6 and add it to the damage."
: Cool.
: Nice.
: It doesn't have to go there.
: Amazing.
": Yeah, perfect. A totem."
: It's gonna go back to the top of the initiative order.
": We have a escape pod again that's working if we wanted, it can hold up to four people. If we wanted to send four people, if it gets really bad and we need it to just like have our ship keep going and have them like attach to an asteroid and hop asteroid to asteroid until they get to the satellite?"
: Yeah the Jib Jobbers can go down with the ship as is in their contract.
: I mean only four people can go on the escape pod and Plug demands a spot. So only three people.
": No, Plug is busy with Bambi."
Lou: Yeah we can sneak out for awhile.
": Yeah Plug demands a spot for Bambi because Plug plus one, so really only two people can go in."
Brennan: So that's gonna be 41 points of damage to the Wurst. I'm gonna need three dexterity saving throws for the ship.
": The tigers slow us down, I'm gonna reaction do a-"
: The ship has advantage on the saving throw.
: Give you advantage on it against the first one. I'll give you advantage on the first one.
: Oh yes.
: All right.
: Dexterity saving throw?
: Plus one.
: That's a 10.
: Watch out.
: So I add a d6?
: A d6.
: That's a power dice?
: Yes.
": Okay, I can reroll power dive once a turn, that was only a two with resourceful tactics Six!"
: Yes.
: Yeah!
": You make the first save, give me another saving throw."
: So this one's just flat?
": Oh no, I will do, I can use a..."
: You can do the reaction from the flare thing too right?
: Are we doing this?
: I'll do that yeah.
: Yeah if you have a reaction.
: Yeah definitely. I have have two reactions.
: How many flares do you have?
Lou: This is all of our flares.
: So 16 on the die.
: 17.
: 17.
": A 17 saves, yes absolutely."
: And so this last one?
: Can I use any of my personal stuff on this? I'm able to train my critical analysis as a reaction.
": Yes, yes."
: Okay I'm giving you also my critical analysis.
": Okay, cool."
Emily: I think you and I need to just slump down-
: 17.
: Yes.
: You pass
: three torpedoes.
": Yes, yes, yes."
": Blow up behind you, you dodge all of them."
: Beautiful piloting.
"Brennan: That's gonna be the Warfare Whitneys. Okay, incoming another 37 points of damage from the Warfare Whitneys."
": I'm going to use cunning avoidance. So once per round, I can make a dex check and use that instead of the value of your AC. And then I'm gonna also use dependable pilot to take the maximum for a dex check."
": Amazing so one of the attacks misses, you get back, so you don't take 14 damage."
": Okay and then the damage we do take, I'm gonna use my reaction to bump that back with our Acme-Ashmun brand shields."
: Hell yes.
: That's a cool six damage.
"Brennan: Warfare Whitney three takes six points of damage. As you guys are sustaining fire these Acme-Ashmun shields have, their energy's been reduced to them. They are struggling"
": these are the top of the line shields in the galaxy, not to get all like, what's that Star Trek quote that Kirk says? ''The given circumstances of this battle are unwinnable.'' You should not be fighting this battle."
: Yeah.
: Cool.
: Yeah.
: Coming out of FTL behind the Wurst. A squadron of U4F ships appears.
: Yes!
": Okay, all right!"
: Thank fucking god.
": Damn, Needles!"
": You on the comms ship, you see"
": first, the Lady Pike appears in the lead on the ship. Jan De La Vega smiles and says, ''Hey there, Maggie. How's it going?''"
: Looking good.
: I am looking good.
": Now I got a question for you, sister, 'cause I made myself pretty clear. Did you pay your union dues this Nargon?"
: I certainly did.
: Your little U4F badge comes up.
": Gorgeous! Jan, I have no time for foreplay right now. Let's get straight to it!"
": Okay, the Lady Pike comes in after you. You guys see another saucer come in this like huge flying saucer. Another comm station comes up. You see from Baustin, New Texas, you see Lamelia Lefarve, hi there fellas, Chets say hi. And you see some of the Chesters waving on the ship."
: Love it.
: I love them. Are they wearing their drug necklaces?
": Right well have to get it done. Wearing their little necklaces of drugs, that ship comes in. You guys see a giant like clamping ship coming in on the comm station with a bristly mustache you see, hey there friends, this is captain Dan Scrap of the Bad Call."
": Dan Scrap, you son of a bitch,"
": Dan Scrap, how are you in the United Female Freedom Fighters?"
": What's that? Oh shit. And you see, he takes a big blonde wig and puts it on. This is Danielle Scrap of the Bad Call."
": He used to make me wear it. It was a whole thing. It was he's great, this is great, this is great. Honestly, it didn't look half bad."
: I bet you looked pretty good.
": He looks beautiful, I get it."
: I was gorgeous.
": And you see another ship coming in, hot out of faster than light. This huge awesome looking winged bulbous ship with the bunch of bright lights. This is call sign the Heartbeat Captain Galatia 9 coming in, U4F, heard your distress signal loud and clear, captain."
": Hello Heartbeat, who is this?"
": You see, there is a space Amazon with a big scar over one eye with like blonde hair tied back in these like twin ponytails and a first mate of this like incredible muscle bound woman with a red and white cap as her chief gunner as the Heartbeat zooms in out of faster than light."
: Incredible.
: Look at these incredibly funny ships.
: I think I know who that is.
": Yeah, I think its on your face right now."
: Who would it be?
: Yeah.
": So having sent that email, which oh baby, was that important for you to do."
: Thank God.
": Jan looks up at you and says, ''All right, Encino, you sent the signal.'' Raymond says, ''I sent the signal.'' Says, ''What's the call, sister? What you need?''"
": What are we thinking, everybody?"
: Create a distraction so we can go into that asteroid field draw 'em away from the asteroid field.
: Yeah I'll give them the info on the U4F ship that's looking pretty hurt.
: Cool.
": Can I do an insight check to see if I, I would know anything or I would know the right questions to ask Skip? Or like what happened with that ship, why it's busted?"
: Yeah you can ask Skip to make a perception check with advantage.
: Yeah.
: Yes!
: 29.
": You do a scan of that ship. Margaret, you send that to him. So there's still a lot more enemies to go. The command ships are all gonna fire again. So you guys were looking at certain death and boom your union, we're union strong here in space, baby, boom, zooms out of space. And you see Jan says, ''Let's open fire!'' And you see these U4F ships peel out"
": boom, and just open fire on all of the fighter craft around you. Lady Pike is gonna come in alongside the Wurst taking movement, but opening weapons fire. The other U4F ships two to the left are gonna break left two to the right are gonna break right. As we move forward, you do that scan there right? Doing the scan, you interface with the ship as you do on that 28, you patch through and you can see the enormous command ship is crawling with people in space suits all over it, and as you patch into their command, you see those people start setting off bombs on their own ship."
: Oh shit.
": The bombs are filled with paint. Arcadia Prime shows up, ''Hello, captains of the Wurst, it is us, the Guernican Art Squad! Thought you could get rid of us? This will be our most glorious Magnum Opus. And you see that paint goes off all over their tigers and command ship, and the Guernican Art Squad has commandeered an Amercadian vessel."
: My god.
: Are they still coming after us? Or they're just kind of doing their own stuff.
: Just like being so random.
": That's U4F, that's gonna be Griivarr. These Griivarr ships are still coming in after the Wurst half of them are gonna fire on the Lady Pike, but five are gonna keep trained on the Wurst. Trying to hit an armor class of 15. That's one hit, it's two hits, three hits. You take seven, 11 plus, you take 20 points of damage."
: Can I use a snap roll? So use a power die to mitigate the damage.
": Go for it, yeah, yeah, yeah."
": Six on the die, so 26."
": Nice, baby."
": Hell yeah, you got some shields left."
: Shields my friend.
": Okay. Griivarr command ship is going to activate its point defense system is then gonna fire an assault turbo laser twice on its turn. It's rolling with disadvantage 'cause it's at long range, but this is an incredibly powerful weapon."
: Is there anything?
: Yeah.
": That is a hit. Second, that is a miss."
: I really think we need to try to turn Griivarr against UFTP.
: Yeah definitely.
: Yeah.
": From a single strike with that assault laser, you take 22 points of damage."
": I did not use the, everything I was using before was not actually a reaction. My only reaction I have is uncanny dodge, which I can use to halve the damage of an attack. So could I use that for this last attack that we just got?"
: Hell yeah.
: Okay.
: Ball's rolling up.
: Ball is rolling up.
"Brennan: Behind you on the Repo-Reapers turn the Lady Pike behind you takes two attacks with its assault cannon and blasts the nearest Repo-Reaper out of the sky. Repo-Reaper number four is no more. Jan De La Vega says, ''Needles, you know what to do.'' (laughs) Yeah Boss! That Repo-Reaper vessel is gone. The rest are going to turn in, their tractor beam is within range. I'm gonna need three strength saving throws from the Wurst."
": And we can use, well actually our strength is better than our dex, right?"
: That's correct.
: Here we go.
: Guaranteed nat 20. Yah-tah-tah Nat 20. (all cheering)
": If you say it every time, you're gonna be right sometimes."
: No way!
: Nat 20!
: Very specifically Murph has said that and I rolled it.
": Incredible, roll the next two with advantage on that nat 20."
: Guaranteed nat 20.
: Really good.
": 18 on the die plus six, so 24."
": Hell yes, gimme one last one."
: 21.
: Woo.
": All three Repo-Reapers come in with tractor beams trying to pull the ship in. You hit the engine, and the engines are super juiced, you dodge outta the way of the Repo-Reaper vessels."
: We got the juice.
": They are going to form a triangle around the Wurst. You still have shields though, right?"
: Yeah.
": Two points. They try to descend boarding ladders onto the ship. Bounce off of the Acme-Ashmun Force shields, they do not connect."
: Yes!
"Brennan: Behind you it is an absolute mess. The Guernican Art Squad has commandeered a number of tigers, they are going to engage with a couple of other ships behind you. So you see Lamelia's saucer and the Bad Call engage with those Guernican tigers behind you, and now the command ships are gonna go. So this is Gust Weatherall's flagship, this is the UFTP command ship, and this is Arcadia Prime's vessel."
: Is it their turn?
: It is their turn.
Siobhan: Oh God.
: We'll resolve these one at a time. We're gonna go.
: This is so awful.
": Can I quickly message him and say like, stop."
": Stop, please stop."
: Just a lowercase.
: Stop.
: Stop.
: Cut it out.
: Come on man.
: This is the bad one 'cause Gust Weatherall just wants to blast you out of the sky. So he's gonna activate point defense.
: Oh my God.
: You're outside of bombardment range. So its just gonna be two.
: Bombardment?
: All right can I use the final power die to use a Colonian Turn to maneuver forward out of this range if possible?
: Go ahead and roll that d6.
: Big six.
: Big six.
: Come on big six.
: Big six.
": Three, 150 feet?"
Brennan: Let's go ahead and move that 150 feet forward. You can put yourself just on the other side of that cloud if you wanna give yourselves three quarters cover behind those Repo-Reapers.
: We can get cover behind the Repo-Reapers.
: Okay so here's whats gonna-
: Against each other.
": So here's what's gonna happen now. Gust Weatherall comes on the comms saying, ''You listen up here, Norm, some secrets are better left buried.''"
: Like the fact that you killed an entire squad of Amercadian soldiers.
": You're at like a seven and we do want like a 10. Just, this is a big moment for your character."
": You are still within range, but you get that cover, three quarters cover behind them. With that thing that you say, go ahead and gimme persuasion."
": And this is just my persuasion, correct?"
: Yeah.
: 12.
": Okay you go over the comms, you see a look of some of the officers on Gust's ship looking around as you state that. It's just words right now. On your turn potentially, so these are gonna be attacks with disadvantage, your AC bumps from 15 to now 21."
: Okay.
: I'm gonna roll these attacks in front of the board.
: Well the first one's a nat one so.
: Yeah and the second one is a nat three.
: Just roll it. It's a nat one so.
": If it comes within five of your armor class, but still misses I'm gonna say it hits one of the Repo-Reapers around you. Okay, here we go. What you don't want is a 14 on the lower of these two."
": Oh, we're not gonna get it it's a nat one. Murph called it."
: It's a nat one.
": 19 and a five that's a full miss. Here's the next one, another five. Lasers shoot off into space, bam, bam, on either side of you, that's going to be-"
": Gust Weatherall, more like Gust Miss-em-all, am I right?"
: Don't hurt my feelings.
: Please hold.
": Guernican command ship, here we go. Okay I'm gonna need a saving throw from the Wurst."
: What type?
": Oh, dexterity. Just give me any saving throw you feel like."
: Thank you so much. Natural 20.
: You gotta be kidding me.
: Yes!
: And then it bumped.
": An enormous bombardment of these makeshift, what looks like glittering spray paint bombs, launch from the Guernican Art Squad's ship. You dodge out as these huge plumes of paint erupt into the void. You continue to surge forward. Last command ship that is going to go is the United Free Trade Planets' command ship directly in front of you. Number one, it creates an 800 foot radius grid. You see laser turrets erupt all over it. These are point defense systems, which means within 800 feet of this thing in all directions, it's going to get free attacks on you, and it's creating difficult terrain by doing so. So it's gonna halve your movement within that range. That is one action."
": So essentially it's creating, like, if we want to go through that, we will get hit."
: We'll get shot and be slow.
: Okay so we have to drive around it.
: Can we shoot those things?
": Oh the things on the ship? Potentially yeah, you could. I would let you guys choose to disrupt that if you wanted to. As that ship continues to move, it has other actions it's going to do. I am now going to need two strength saving throws."
: Both nat 20s. Good lord.
: 11.
": I have the heads up that I haven't used. So you would just add a superiority die, which for me is a d6."
: Okay...
": Wait, make a big deal of it, 12!"
: 12.
: 12!
: It's a meaty 12.
: That's actually pretty good. It's a 12.
: Do I even do this other one?
": That won't be necessary. You get hit by a UFTP tractor beam. This is the command ship, I mean, they set themselves up right in between you and your target and they lock you in and they immediately are gonna move the Wurst a hundred feet towards them, and then with their next action."
: Man.
": Okay, I don't hate it."
: They open fire.
": Pick a lane. Either tractor beam us or shoot us, don't do both."
: They deal 44 points of damage to... (to the tune of ''My Hero'' by the Foo Fighters) ♪ There goes our shields... ♪ to Repo-Reaper number two.
": Okay, okay."
: Not to us?
": No, they got people, they got these scavengers, coming in and taking their shit. They're trying to get you guys. Ohhhhh (collective relieved sighing)"
: He knew what he was doing.
": I knew what I was doing. Hey, having a lot of enemies can work out in your favor sometimes, with that you are hit with the tractor beam, I'm going to need a constitution saving throw from Barry Syx."
": Whoa, whoa."
: Did you get slugged? Did you secretly get slugged?
: He went into the zone.
": I'm in the zone, but that doesn't do anything."
: Are you within range or something of the other Barry or something?
": Something's going on, and I don't like it."
": Other Barry's on UFTP, yeah that's true they could be working together."
: He's on the Fang maybe.
: Maybe we're getting close to it.
: Too close to the-
: Come on... (groaning)
": Murph, did you roll metal dice?"
": No I didn't, I rolled the dice that Ally gave me."
: I'm so sorry.
: Thank you for being a good friend.
: I'm so sorry I care about you.
: I rolled a two and I have plus six so I got an eight.
: Okay.
: You can't make me roll saving throws.
": I'm so sorry, that is actually my fault."
: To Barry?
": 58 damage halved just to Barry Syx. Barry in your gunner channel, you hear (metal rolling) and a stun grenade flies into the gunner pit boom goes off. You are stunned and Barry Nyne crits twice on you."
: What?
: Yeah 'cause stun auto crits.
: But is Barry Nyne on our ship?
: Barry Nyne is on the Wurst.
: What the hell.
: You see he goes-
: Since when?
": Time to die, Barry. You take that, but it is halved as you are in the zone."
": Where did he come from, or was he hiding in the walls? And is he, where is he wearing Loose Duke's clothes?"
: Did Loose Duke let you in?
: Is he wearing Loose Duke's clothing? Let me do a free object interaction to look for Loose Duke?
": Okay so this is challenging, you are in the middle of star ship combat. You are now also in the middle of tactical combat aboard the Wurst as Barry Nyne has just acted, it goes to the ship's turn, but I need perception checks from everybody. Regular perception checks."
: Nat 20.
": Okay Riva. Don't worry about perception checks, on a Nat 20 Riva you sense violence occurring on the Wurst. You know that Barry's been shot and immediately everyone gets a psychic impression of that, but you have to choose whether you're gonna use your turn to deal with that or deal with the star ship battle you are engaged in."
": Great, perfect, beautiful, couldn't be happier. Do we have things though that are particularly good against situations of this sort."
": I bought some, but I'm stunned."
: Goddamn it.
: I bought something as well.
: We bought cryo cells to-
": Oh, for this guy. I could handle this."
: You got it?
: I can handle this.
: Then maybe I should just keep flying.
: Yeah.
": Pilot, pilots gotta."
: I've got multiple.
": So here's what's gonna happen at the moment right now, which is we go, if you want to go into mini's initiative, if you're doing something on the ship, Sid you would be first to act with the 22."
": Okay I've got multiple options to try to do this. I'm gonna have to roll crazy well, if I wanna make this work. Okay I think I'm going to, I think with Aurora Nebbins, if I cast motivator boost on her that means her speed is doubled which would also would that also mean that her bonus action?"
: Is also doubled.
": Okay, is 90 feet of movement enough to get me to his gunning thing."
": Yeah that's right so yes, absolutely. The ship 'cause I'm looking at the dimensions in space right now, absolutely. Your gunner ports are not, are just on other sides of the ship."
: So I don't even need to cast motivator boost then I can just use Aurora Nebbins to get there.
": Yes Aurora sees trouble and goes ah, and lunges forward. You're riding this beautiful royal blue mastiff to the other gunner pod."
": I have my cryo cell loaded up, I'm going to with my action attack twice Barry Nyne."
": Barry Nyne, amazing."
: Slug Barry.
": You see him in the shadows, just unloading on a stunned Barry Syx, go ahead and make your attacks."
": First one, advantage does a 19 hit?"
: A 19 hits.
: Okay. We have to keep track of this cold damage.
: Cool.
: So that's seven cold damage and then he needs to do a-
: DC 14 con save.
": DC oh, except I have my explosives master style, so-"
: DC 16.
: DC 16 con save.
: He rolls a two on the die.
: Okay so then that's another two cold damage. So we're up to 11 cold damage.
: And he's slowed until the end of the next turn.
: Great.
: I take my second attack. Does a 14 hit?
: 14 does not hit.
: Targeted strike.
: Okay cool.
": So add a, we'll do a d6 and then this will add to the damage too."
: Okay.
: Amazing.
: Four.
": Okay, so does a 18 hit?"
: 18 does hit.
: Okay. So then that's another-
: Incredible.
: Then that's another 14 cold damage.
: So 26.
: So we're over 25.
: 26 yeah.
: Amazing.
: So we're trying to suss out we're trying to get the slug out of there.
: Amazing.
": With this cold damage, you do 26 cold damage to him. So what is the exact wording for Cerebro Slugs?"
": For a body thief if the host body takes 20 points of cold damage in a single round, the Cerebro Slug must make a DC 15 con save using its own constitution score. Not Barry's constitution."
: Important.
: Very important.
": Very, very important."
: On a failure the Cerebro Slug leaves the body slithering out to a space within five feet of the host.
: Put a bowl over it.
": Oh, I'm gonna fucking stomp on it with my fucking roller feet."
": After exiting the host, it is paralyzed until the start of its next turn."
: Which I still-
: Everyone remember I'm incapacitated so please do not let this thing slug me.
": No, it's not going to."
: Just please.
: That would be so bad.
: Let's all remember where we are on the board.
": Who's the real Barry? I'm the real Barry, he's the real Barry, yeah."
: I've got the ponytail.
: Syx and Nyne are upside down we're the same thing!
": All right, you blast Barry Nyne with cold damage. Give me a perception check."
: 19 on the dice is gonna become 22.
": Okay you've used your actions, two attacks, in a blast of cold Barry Nyne stumbles back clutching at his face. He's very much in the zone right now. You do not see the slug leave from the thing. That could be there's a lot of explanations for why that could be."
: Maybe because he's in the zone?
": Is it because he's in the zone, in that case I'm just gonna throw two stun grenades at him. Actually wait, what do we think that Barry sucks at? What do we think Barry sucks at?"
: Oh man he sucks at-
: Intelligence
": Zero wisdom, zero intelligence."
: Then I'm gonna throw a panic grenade for the first one. So a DC 16 wisdom save or be frightened and take more damage.
: He fails.
: Okay so he is frightened and he takes six psychic damage.
: Copy that.
: And then fuck it. I'm also just gonna do more damage.
: Hell yeah go for it.
: I'll just throw another generic grenade at him.
: Hell yeah.
: I'm just gonna throw a plasma grenade.
: Massive explosions going on.
: Aren't you guys like in a little hallway?
: How much damage does a grenade do? 'cause I might want to just get hit by this just to wake up.
": Oh, it'll wake you up if you take damage?"
": Right? 'Cause I'll be stunned, 'cause right? I need someone with an action to slap me awake."
: Yeah he's fully unconscious so a little bit-
: If you hit me with a grenade.
Brennan: You can hit them both with a grenade.
: I'm gonna try and hit them both with a grenade.
: As long as it's not one of the bad ones just fucking hit me.
: Okay then I'll do one of my lighter ones. I'll do an ion grenade.
: Cool.
": And if he has anything electronic on him, it'll turn off and need to be rebooted."
": Copy that great, and that's a dex save right?"
: Dex save yeah 16.
": He rolls with advantage 'cause he's in the zone, but he still fails."
": Okay. So just another nine damage and you'll take nine damage, but then you'll wake up, right?"
: You take nine damage.
: Okay.
Brennan: You've dealt 41 points of damage with grenades. The ship takes four hull points of damage.
"Emily: Okay I get on the comms and I'm like, I had to do it, Barry's in trouble."
: It's okay!
: Its gonna be okay.
": I'm not unconscious anymore, but I'm still stunned. I'm emotionally stunned."
: Yeah.
": It's okay, we're gonna get this thing out."
: Father.
": Incredible, Barry you're up. We're gonna keep moving through mini's initiative that's Sid and Aurora. We can, is anyone else interested in, wanna jump into minis or do we want to resolve ship?"
": I might wanna jump into minis. Let me put it past the group, I can potentially I'm thinking, phase walk into the Amercadian ship and then do some shenanigans from there, but I would have to do it next turn because phase walk is a spell."
: I mean definitely that over damage. I don't think we're trying to do damage right now.
": Okay, great I will do that. I will phase walk into the water system of the UFTP ship."
: That's so crazy.
": You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a small tall opening, a door, or container, stowing or retrieving an item. So I'll just, if you're okay with me doing that, I'll just use that."
": So you're using the, you're using the psychic points to do that quickened."
: Actually I don't need to 'cause phase walk is a bonus action.
": Incredible, amazing so Riva you are in your bulb. Things are looking as bad as they've ever looked, half the galaxy is here to destroy you. You reach out psychically feel all of the minds aboard that UFTP command ship, behind you Skip, you see Riva glow with astral light and disappear, and you see a kind of telescoping trail of images of Riva shoot through the void towards the UFTP ship. They even fire some lasers at this like phasing image, and you are in a giant tank of water, looking at a very confused cafeteria of UFTP employees aboard this command ship."
": Great, I immediately used my movement to swim somewhere between decks so that none of them can see me."
: You disappear between decks. Go ahead it's gonna be a straight roll. I'm gonna say 'cause all you're trying to do is mess up the tractor beam.
: Yeah.
": Which a lot of things should be able to do, you're just trying to reach out psychically and jam whatever board they're doing that with because you have walked aboard, I'm gonna say that you do this roll with advantage, but it's going to be effectively like a technology check. We're just calling it a DC, I'm gonna call it DC 12."
": Okay I have a minus one to technology, but I have advantage so that's okay. I don't make it."
": Cool. You reach out try to jam the ship. You can hear shouts and screaming of the minds. You're doing something to the command deck of the ship, but you are aboard their ship."
: Okay.
": Barry, I assume-"
: I'm stunned until the end of my turn.
: There you go.
: So my stun will clear.
: Okay yeah.
": So Margaret, Skip, Gunnie, I assume you guys are doing ship related things?"
": I'm doing ship related things, yes."
: Okay you guys can confer together about what it is you wanna do.
": I mean like I can't really fly at this, right, or?"
: You can use an action to reroll the saving throw.
: To get out of the tractor beam?
": We're like slippery, I bet there's something."
"Brennan: To try to get out of the saving throw, yeah absolutely."
": We, so we get one shield, hull, one reactor die back."
": Yes and also you get a shield die back as well, 'cause your shields are still up correct?"
": I'd say it's halved, but we get it."
: Okay.
: So I rolled a four. So now it's a two.
: It's two.
Brennan: You get two shield points back.
Lou: But now that's over and so we're back to normal.
: Cool I think I'm down with the Jib Jobbers and I would love to like knock out some things on my list.
: Hell yes.
Ally: If that's cool with you guys?
: Should we put Gnosis in the ship?
: Yeah maybe we could use Gnosis to shut down-
: To like power our shields or something?
: Totally.
: Thanks.
: Gnosis is really strong.
: We're pretty desperate. Yeah I'd love to shove Gnosis into their spot.
": Let me know what we're doing, so in the reactor core, you've?"
: Is it a full action to push Gnosis in?
Brennan: I'll say it's object interaction.
: Oh thank god. Yes I'd like to use my object interaction to jack in Gnosis.
": The holofract spins, Gnosis, Gunnie are we almost there?"
": Yeah, it's not looking great."
": Oh, we're in a tremendous amount of trouble."
: Yep is anything you can do to help.
: I can try.
"Brennan: And you see Gnosis it looks at you and says, ''It looks like you're trying to, can I help with blank?''"
: Great I can I ask Gnosis to regenerate shields?
"Brennan: Gnosis is going to attempt to regenerate shields. I'm going to need, here's what I'm gonna do. Gnosis is gonna do this, but Gnosis is too powerful."
: Love it.
Brennan: So I'm gonna need a regulation check from you.
: Happy to do it.
Brennan: Regulation check from the ship all you wanna do is you want to beat a 10 here.
: Okay.
: The more you beat a
: Great do I add anything to this?
: It's a regulation check so whatever-
: Plus three?
: Plus three.
: A flat ten.
": Okay, okay."
: Okay!
": I'll take it, I'll take it."
: Okay I'm gonna roll as many d8s as you want me to.
: Okay.
: That's how many shield points that you're gonna regenerate. I'm gonna take half that number and you're gonna take that much hull damage.
": 14, 14 feel safe?"
: I was gonna say 12.
: 12 sounds good.
: Sweet 16.
: I love sweet 16.
": 10, 10, 10."
: 10?
: A nice even number.
": We'll do, we'll do a-"
: What about a dirty 20?
": We'll do a 12, we'll do a safe 12."
": A safe 12, great."
: Go off Gnosis.
: It's all eights.
: You don't wanna jack into the experience?
: I gonna jack it.
": You jack into the experience, great. So Gunnie you, it's not enough time. You're doing an object interaction, so you don't close the reactor. You just jam Gnosis in, your cybernetic arms connect with Gnosis, you regenerate that is 5, 7, 12, Gunnie, you have Acme-Ashmun brand stuff correct? Of course I do."
": What did I say, 48?"
: Oh my God.
": Gunnie, you gain 48 shield points on your person as you, Gunnie, Gnosis goes, what are you doing this isn't safe."
": It, hey, we have to do this."
": You feel your brain as just ones and zeros fly past your mind. A shield generator forms in somewhere in your bowels. I think you, you form a second mechanical heart in your torso. Just your blood is past boiling temperature, your blood becomes a gas. You see the past and future extend beyond you, all of the multiverse unfolds in a moment of pure communion with the extent of Mother Void and the vast galaxy around you, and you have the rest of your turn left."
: Does anyone have any cigarettes?
": So for everyone else around you by the way, you see the Acme-Ashmun shields come back online, you see the protective force shield surrounding you. Also rivets come flying out of your ship, red hot, ping, ping, bang, steam bursts out."
": Oh, can I have one? I wanted to do one more thing with Handy Annie."
": Yeah, what's up?"
": I wanted to just send a message to Auma and be like, hey mom, you put all my friends in danger, but I know you're fricking rolling in it, so if you wanted to spend all that dirty money you got in a good way, send Vercadian Protector Droids. Specifically hot ones 'cause I kinda have a thing."
: Give me a persuasion with advantage.
: 17 on the dice I think just becomes 18.
: Cool we're gonna resolve that at the end of the round.
: So we only get one power die back a turn.
": We only get one power die back a turn. I can either bring, give us hull points or give us more reactor die."
: Yeah let's resolve the rest of the ship's turn 'cause we still have all of Margaret to go.
: I think having more die feels valuable here 'cause like we're making a B-line for the fan.
: Yeah we gotta just keep going. We're never gonna take more damage than we are right now.
: Yeah.
: 'Cause we're in the mix.
": I'm gonna boost, I'll boost the reactor."
: Hell yeah. (Lou laughs)
: That's...we're gonna really juice it.
": Okay, all right."
": So I rolled an eight on the dice that's, so we're gonna but we can only go up to four and then-"
: So you get four power dice back.
": It says for any power dice produced in excess, your ship takes that many hull points of damage so it'll take five hull points of damage and then we'll make a regulation check DC 18, which we fail."
": Before we move forward is there any stuff you add to saving throws or stuff like that, that could?"
: Oh I can add defiant to that.
: Can you do thing to your thing to it?
Brennan: What did you roll on that save?
: That was a 16.
": Copy that, you need an 18. So you just need a two, three, or four."
: I didn't get it.
": Really? Okay then I'll if this is a saving throw, I can use my reaction to give you critical analysis, so that's plus five."
": Okay, plus five."
: Great.
": You make the save, this ship is running hot. Skip, on the pilot's control, all these dials of internals of ship are just like clicking and breaking. Any other actions or things coming outta the mechanics room right now?"
: No that's everything going down.
"Brennan: Cool, right here."
": Okay so I'm going to use an action I guess, to-"
": Try to break out of this, yeah."
": 15 on the die plus 6, 21."
": You break outta the tractor beam. Now you're still you're in its point defense system, so it's difficult to terrain everywhere and you're gonna have to be making dex saving throws."
": Okay, I'm gonna use my full movement forward it's just 300 feet right now, I believe unless someone boosts the engines or boosts the-"
: Yeah it's 300.
": Okay so 300, and then my bonus action slippery pilot to move an extra 300, so 600 feet forward."
": Okay the Wurst is gonna move 600 feet forward. It has an 800 foot range on its point defense system, so as you enter give me a dexterity saving throw."
": All right, that's gonna be..."
": Jumping behind you, Zortch is gonna give you the direct action. Zortch leaps to the bridge of the ship and says I gotcha."
": All right, let's do this one..."
: Yes.
: Yeah!
": You weave in and out of lasers, flying forward as fast as you can, you enter difficult terrain now your movement is gonna be halved again, Margaret."
": Thank God, okay I would like to try this encouraging speech to all the Jib Jobbers once again to get more people helping."
": Hell yes. Go ahead give me a persuasion check. What is the offer for the amount of time, free time, on the ship you are giving to the Jib Jobbers?"
: One year of free Jib Job.
": A galactic, you're offering two galactic cycles, two standard cycles."
: Two cycles.
": The Jib Jobbers look up, roll this persuasion with advantage."
": Incredible, okay we're gonna use this one. Okay that is a 17."
: Plus 11 is 28.
": No, no, no."
: I'm sorry.
": No, just total 17."
: Total 17.
: Total 17.
: Oh boy.
: Okay.
": Plus, well plus 10 yeah."
": All right so you see astoundingly, a 17, of the 13 Jib Jobbers, seven go wow two free cycles that's nice, and another six go, I'm good."
": Okay, that's okay, that's okay we're gaining numbers. So now I have what?"
: Yeah you already had?
: Four I think.
": Four, right? Okay so with another six that's 10. You have 10, oh so three of them look pretty obstinate, three are not gonna come on board."
": That's okay you know what, keep writing your romance novels."
": I mean, apparently they're doing pretty well if they can refuse that."
": Okay so this is my little situation room. I'm like, okay, everybody, we gotta break up. I take two of the Jib Jobbers and I say, ''you need to go and slap Barry Nyne, slap Barry Syx in the face right now, run down the hall.''"
": Oh, he's already, he's already awake."
: You're already awake.
: Yeah.
: Oh from the damage!
": Oh, I do have the stuff we bought off Plug before the session, I bought two med packs. If someone wants to hit me with a med pack that would be awesome."
": Two, because I got the thing from Riva that he's in trouble, so two people run down there. I want Raymond Zam to reach out to Acme-Ashmun, Dora Valentine there, and say we are very publicly getting completely run down with all of our like Acme-Ashmun gear, and this is a PR nightmare. We heard that the news is gonna be here shortly. I have two Jib Jobbers contacting Jimmy the Snout at Rootersnoos about this entire thing and saying that they might wanna send some camera people to what's going on here at Rubian V. And then I personally would like to go through and edit and find the exact moment in that Handy Annie footage of Lucienne saying, we're gonna have more money than God, and then we're just gonna buy out the Griivarr worlds. We're just gonna buy out this thing saying like exact numbers and their whole plan, and I would like to send that in a message to the Griivarr like ship, I just want that to start playing on their ship for them."
": Incredible okay, you have a ton of actions here. So you are going to send Lucienne talking about the-"
: UFTP plan.
": The UFTP Frangus, house of Frangus contract. Go ahead, you have two Jib Jobbers on that?"
": No, that's me personally."
": Oh, that's you personally, go ahead give me a persuasion with advantage."
": Okay, okay. That is a 17 again."
": 17 again, copy that, any other stuff you want do on top of that or that's it?"
": Oh, I can like train as a bonus action my own, I'm gonna put my thing on myself, my critical analysis."
: And is that a plus five to your roll?
": Yes, so that's a 23."
": Boom, there's like little soft, very, you know, elegantly designed kind of modern couches. There's coffee people are coming out-"
: Yeah I made a matcha fountain where people can just dip their cups.
": So a miniature war room of personal assistants for you opens up, and there's just this little email hub of like, hi, I am a screenwriter momentarily working as a personal assistant from Margaret Encino of the Wurst, we in active combat, just like this little campaign office opens up."
: Yes.
": Uncle Bob. Hey there kiddo, it's Uncle Bob from the Griivarr worlds. I see you're trying to contact the Griivarr ships, are you ready to surrender that piece of Griivarr technology over to us?"
": Look, I'm ready to surrender this piece of information, and I send the video to them and say, you may have your sights trained on the wrong enemy number one, and I send it to them."
": Now, Uncle Bob's been dead for a minute so this artificial intelligence running the spirit of Uncle Bob instantly downloads that and goes, it's a real pal who helps a friend out with secrets that were being kept from them. Gang, we're gonna train our guns on United Free Trade Planets, and you see the entire Griivarr faction, the command ship wheels its main guns."
: Fuck yeah.
": Tide is turning. Or as we like to say here, the ball is rolling up. Incredible, that's one action."
: Holo-recorder Handy Annie.
: Yeah thank you Handy Annie. Great thought.
: Secret MVP of this is Handy Annie with a fucking GoPro.
": Speaking of Handy Annie, Auma Liu appears on a screen in front of you as you are fighting Barry Nyne."
": Mom, hey."
": Hi I'm bad, I'm bad."
": I understand, I understand why you did what you did and-"
": You don't, you don't understand why I did what I did."
: I know I don't. I'm sorry.
: It's okay.
: I'm sorry. Are you mad at me that I don't understand? Are you mad at me that I'm mad at you?
": No listen, I need you to send your schematics to me right now. I only have the trademark. I don't have your journal schematics."
": I have them downloaded, SQ send my schematics back."
": All hail the glorious Gnosis, the world God computer, sending files."
": SQ by the way, I know we both enjoyed a little romp with Gnosis, but you've gotta try a Vercadian protector droid."
": Woo, do tell. And you see sends this file over, Auma gets it, sent, and you see something on her end happens. You watch all of the Warfare Whitneys behind you deactivate. She says, I bought, look, I leveraged the position, and then I sent some stuff about you with the, see because Handy Annie had you, so I released that footage of you in order to depreciate Handy Annie's market value. I bought Handy Annie outright, I bought the whole company. I sent something to file an injunction so there's a lawsuit, they have to shut down all the Warfare Whitneys for trademark infringement and copyright infringement with your schematics, I was waiting to send it until I could get your schematics. I bought Handy Annie and I filed this suit because we're gonna make the rest of your line."
": Okay, I'm also gonna collect all these Warfare Whitney bodies and maybe we could make 'em into something cool too, 'cause they're actually really quite powerful now that they're deactivated I can say I was scared shitless."
": You got it, you got it. I understand. There were a lot of fast moves getting made and I got your message too, warping out of faster than light two squadrons of Vercadian protector droids appear outside. You see out of the window as you're still here fighting Barry Nyne, outside of your window floating 12 feet tall in space you see Veep 909."
": You do a good job out there, I'm gonna dip you later."
: I'd like to see you try.
: Shout out to the 909.
: Incredible.
": Jib Jobber, med pack me."
": Yeah, you can see slow motion running down the hall, there's one graphic designer and a DJ from the Jib Job space."
: Fedora flies off.
": Fedora flies off, you see both of them skid under one of the most dangerous clone troopers in the galaxy and double med pack you, roll your own hit points."
: Shit.
: God.
: Cool.
": Oh, we had, I mean, you know it was me, Raymond Zam and then all the Jib Jobbers. If I can squeeze one more thing in and have Jib Jobbers create a Smash 'n Grab to shoot down the Repo-Reapers. I would love to do that."
": Oh, sorry, you reached out to Dora Valentine, we didn't cover that yet, right? Okay Dora Valentine emails you back and says our legal department has been moving incredibly slowly on closing out Gunnie's contract. I'm giving you the login right now to our legal staff, please don't tell anyone I did this."
": Thank god, okay no I do that instead, yeah I absolutely like absolve Gunnie's debt and figure that out."
": All right, I am gonna need from you, it's a DC 20 finance roll."
: Finance I got.
: We're gonna bring out the Box of Doom.
: Oh my God.
: Plus 11?
Siobhan: The biggest roll of the century.
: So it's plus 11?
": Plus 11, you just need a nine or higher in the Box of Doom. (all cheering) Margaret in the middle of combat you log in, Dora Valentine, Gunnie's old mentor, sends you the login, you see this incredible email chain that's like 80 emails deep, you instantly process all of it jump into a PDF, red line, da da da da, have your matcha, make the perfect final offer, your email is filled with all of it. Circle back, put a pin in this da, da, da, da, you send it through. On a DC 20 finance check - Gunnie, in the reactor room on your comms a message appears... ''Paid In Full''"
": Gunnie just grabs a quick pen, just a, like a, like a dry erase marker. I can do whatever the fuck I want."
": Your cybernetic organs, your limbs, your prostheses, this top of the line cyborg body is yours and yours alone, forever."
: I send you a link to tattoo ideas.
: Oh we're gonna get matching ones for sure.
": From those three remaining Repo-Reaper ships you hear, ''God dammit, all right pack it in boys.'' They all jump to FTL to get out of this clusterfuck. Repo-Reaper faction defeated."
Siobhan: Thank goodness.
": They do have really cool ships though, could they do they leave one for us?"
": Margaret, I think that's all the actions you're gonna get on your turn. That's a pretty incredible-"
: You mean this to-do list that we absolutely knocked out in this turn?
: The most powerful to-do list in the entire world.
: Now you can enjoy the rest of your day.
: Yeah now I can just sit by the matcha fountain and relax.
: Yeah do you have me time on there?
": No, I put on some baroque."
": Just a super proud tradition of emailing during combat and having it be incredibly effective. Amazing, however there are still many factions barreling down on top of you. I wanted to make sure that I got everything. We did Auma, you're aboard the UFTP command ship."
: The news was called.
": Oh we didn't, yeah you had other people doing that. Go ahead and give me a persuasion check. Just a straight persuasion check. We'll call it DC 20 persuasion for the news stuff."
: Oh yeah 25.
: Oh yes.
": You see on a private comms just to you, Jimmy the Snout appears in front of you. This is Jimmy the Snout, Rootersnoos Ferret, coming to you live in a personal communique, just me and you, this is how I talk to people even interpersonally."
": Oh, that's actually kind of cool. You look, I got a scoop for you, okay? And then I, oh, I sell all the juicy details."
: You sell it?
: I tell all.
: You tell Weatherall.
": I tell Weatherall. I talk about the stolen patent from of the Warfare Whitneys, I just dish."
: Coming in hot.
": All my stuff's done, I dish."
": You see a ton of vessels behind Gust Weatherall's command ship that all just say Rec Station News, come out faster than light."
": I take a fucking indica gummy and I just, I just vent. I say, you know what, what else? I think Sid had sex with a Vercadian Protector droid."
": Not yet, but I have every intention of it."
: Amazing.
: Lucienne's so funny.
: Okay this is what she gave me.
": Incredible turn, things are still looking dire, but there is hope left. So Barry you at the end of your turn, come out of the stunned condition. Give me a perception check with advantage, and I'm gonna let, you're gonna do this too. Go ahead and give me a..."
: 21.
: 18.
": 18, both of you look up, Barry stumbles backward you're looking for the slug you did 20 points of cold damage."
: He is frightened too.
": He's frightened oh, you see Barry screaming. You see Barry Nyne going, ''What did you do you killed them all, you killed them all!''"
: Barry?
: Tucked into his belt is a plastic bag.
: Is that where the slug went?
": Ripped, like it was torn off of someone."
: The Princeps.
": Oh, you're telling me the plastic bag didn't work?"
: Are you rolling for how many kisses he's gonna do?
: Two attacks.
: The Princeps isn't there.
: Is the escape pod still there? Would we have been notified?
: It's Plug's shop.
: It's Plug's.
": Skip, you take first 28, and then 35 points of damage."
: What?
: Damn.
": As you are piloting the ship you feel a crystal dagger pulled from your belt and reaching around you plunged into your stomach and pulled, as Zortch whispers into your ear, ''Time to come home my son.''"
": So on the 35, I'm going to uncanny dodge and that's the only reason I'm alive."
": I want you to come home, son. Zortch puts a hand to their ear, but of course we know this is not Zortch and says, ''United Free Trade Planets, I'm about to bring the Wurst aboard the command ship and hits the control panel and the doors to the bridge, and that is gonna be all for this episode of Dimension 20, tune in next week for the thrilling finale, Prilbus versus Valdrinor, Skip versus Zortch."
: Prilbus!
: Valdrinor!

(air swooshing sound)
(blast sound)
(upbeat jazz)
(upbeat music)
"Brennan: Hello one and all! Welcome back to the thrilling finale of Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey! I'm your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan, with me as always, our Intrepid Heroes, say hi, Intrepid Heroes!"
"All: Hi, Intrepid Heroes."
Brennan: Last we left off-
"Siobhan: Wait a minute, what is going on?"
"Brennan: What is going on? Oh, you just fully snarfed. Emily just fully snarfed. Emily just snarfed all over."
": Through the nose, onto the mic set."
: You freaking snarfed!
"Emily: I didn't, I don't wanna dispel the myth 'cause I like the idea of snarf, but I just spilled out of my actual mouth."
Brennan: Oh!
(all laughing)
"Gang, last we left off our Intrepid Heroes, were in pitched combat, a roiling dogfight! The void filled with hyon beams, exploding missiles, torpedoes, bombs, androids flying through space. People coming out of faster than light travel right in orbit of the moon Rubian V, near the satellite, the Fang of Frangus, where Gnosis can either save the planet, disperse itself throughout the galaxy and rescue our Intrepid Heroes from the fate that awaits them if they hold on to this incredible deific holofract, or... perhaps the Princeps Zortch can be used to trigger The Great Emhatchening. It's all up in the air folks. As it stands right now, Sundry Sidney and Barry Syx are in pitched combat with Barry Nyne below decks. Gunnie has just got a second heart and is radiating shield energy, having plugged Gnosis into the reactor core."
Lou: What's going on?
: Full Doctor Who shit is happening.
": Yeah, I'm on a different level."
"Brennan: Riva is currently aboard a different ship, having teleported into the command ship of your most rival faction, United Free Trade Planets. Margaret Encino, running a really just humming office down at the JibJob space, getting a lot of emails sent, being very productive, getting a lot done."
Ally: There's just like sound effect in an office where there's just like one phone ringing.
(phone ringing mouth sounds)
": There's always just one phone ringing, to let you know you're in an office."
": Yeah, yeah."
: And Skip has just been stabbed in the stomach!
Ally: No!
": Ah, father!"
: Prilbus!
Brennan: Prilbus!
Zac: Prilbus!
"Brennan: We return to pitched combat in this, the final episode of Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey. You either have the possibility of clearing your names, escaping trouble and perhaps living to see another day or perhaps today a planetary cerebroslug shoots into a black hole at the center of the galaxy and destroys creation, or-"
: Is there still a season two if we go into the black hole?
: Yeah.
Siobhan: We're just really tiny.
Brennan: You'll just have to wait to find out.
(all laughing)
"Brennan: We return to initiative, back at the top of the order as the United Free Trade Planets' fighters and the Brigade Tigers both engage. Talespire, let's be ready to move those Brigade Tigers coming off of Gust Weatherall's flagship 800 feet forward. However, if you notice, stationed there in front of those Tigers are two U4F ships coming into battle. One of which with the call sign, ""The Harpy"". Who was the person that sent the email to Jan De La Vega? Or who was the person: It was Raymond Zam who sent the U4F?"
: Yeah.
": But he used your account, right?"
: Mm-hm.
: Could you give me a— Roll 2d4 for me.
": Okay, mm."
"Murph: Come on, come on."
"Ally: Snake eyes! Ugh, four and a six. No, a four and two, six."
"Brennan: Four and a two, as the Brigade Tigers race forward towards the asteroid belt surrounding Rubian V, you see that the green ship to the right takes out two of them. The Harpy swoops in! (guns blasting) Fills space with hyon beams and blasts four of the tigers out the sky."
"Ally: Oh my God, those things are so intense."
"Brennan: So, six of those Tigers are no more, the other four race past those U4F ships, Talespire. However, it is also United Free Trade Planets. They are going to circle on the Wurst, that they see has just broken out of the tractor beam. So our UFTP faction is going to round."
"Zac: Am I just fighting? Like, I can't use any of my ship stuff right now?"
"Brennan: You can use your ship stuff if you would, 'cause you're at the pilot control. So you can stay there, but using your, but then you won't have your reaction for whatever's happening."
: After.
"Brennan: On the bridge, yeah."
": Yeah, yeah."
"Brennan: Okay, so, UFTP is rounding on the Wurst, gonna roll a whole bunch of attacks. First thing's first, I'm gonna need"
Zac: Okay.
"Ally: But we have Vercadian protector droids, right?"
": You sure do, but it is not their turn yet."
": Okay, 10?"
: 10.
: I only have a plus one to these.
"Emily: Okay, wait, don't all of our"
"oh, we don't have any flares left."
"Murph: Nope, no."
"Brennan: And you can roll a bunch of d20s at once. I'll tell you right now, so you can roll five at a time."
Siobhan: Want some sons and daughters?
"Zac: I'll take one: One, two, three."
(tense music)
: That's not even my d20 that I just gave you. Where did that come from?
: What does it look like?
: It's a kind of green.
": 17, 19, these, so- Eight, and that 13 is cocked. It is now a nine."
": Okay, copy that."
Zac: So that's five of them.
": Okay, that's five so that's three successes, two failures."
": A 17... Well- An 18, a 17, a 16, an 18 and a 11."
: And an 11.
Zac: Yeah.
": Okay, that is four successes and one failure."
Zac: Great.
Brennan: So that's seven successes and three failures. Hold on one second. Bah buh bum… Okay. (dice clatter) That's going to be-
Ally: Pretty good.
"Brennan: 10, 21."
: Three failures out of 10.
Brennan: 21.
: That's great.
: Incredible.
: Outliers.
: Outliers.
: Freaking outliers.
: Three outliers.
"Lou: It's crazy, it's crazy. It's crazy how sometimes averages work out in our favor, consistently, 'cause the ball is rolling up, but you know."
Emily: It really does sound like Outlier's like Shield: Outlier.
Lou: Outliers.
: Outlier.
: Outliers.
: That's an intellectual shield for me.
Brennan: The ship takes 79 points of energy damage.
: (Screams) We are-
: Excuse me?
: Halved.
": Okay, I was gonna be like, “We’re dead.”"
: To 15.
: To 39.
Ally: What?
"Emily: Okay, we still got shields, my friends."
Lou: This is why I'm trying to roll 22 d8s.
: So we took 39.
(mimicking torpedo sounds)
"Brennan: As torpedoes strafe from all of the UFTP fighters surrounding you, once again over the comms you hear Damien Factor saying,"
"Damien: Again, Marge, if you're listening, I just wanna make it really clear, we'd love to keep your ship in the air, we're just gonna really need the princeps as soon as you can hand them over."
"Ally: I pretend that I'm Riva and I go,"
Margaret: Hold please.
Brennan: Okay.
: But you don't put it on mute.
"Ally: But I don't put it on mute. I go, fuck, fuck, fuck."
"Brennan: Okay, that is-"
": Just so everyone knows, Hey, just chiming in on the gunner channel, we have 13 shields and 24, 25 hull points."
Siobhan: Okay.
": So if there was ever a time to panic, it would probably be next turn, not yet!"
(all laughing)
: I will certainly panic.
": Incredible, the Warfare Whitneys deactivated, hanging in space. Up next, it's gonna be U4F. You hear from Jan De La Vega, hey there Captain Maggie, what you think? You want us to keep peeling people off your tail or do you want us to dive in?"
: What do you guys think?
: Peel.
: Peel.
: Peel.
": Peeling, peeling has been really good actually."
: Peeling has been really.
": Jan, mommy."
": Peeling, what's peel?"
: Peel people off our tail.
": Oh, and what was the opp- What's dive in?"
: Dive right in.
: That probably just means like attack the big ships.
Zac: Oh.
"Brennan: Yeah, it's sort of like, do you want them to stay back with the factions behind you and keep them busy?"
"Ally: Well, I will say-"
: Maybe the ones that are right around us.
": I think they should still, because the only people that are actually like fighting."
": Yeah, the Griivarr, everybody's going at each other."
": Griivarr is about to go for U4F- Or UFTP, and UFTP is the only one who would still be going for us that's close by."
: But these tiny UFTP fighter ships-
": UFTP, that's true Griivarr might go after the UFTP fighter ships around us. That's the only UFTP, right? It's the big mothership and then the other guys."
": So I say, keep maybe hanging back and keep working on like the artists and Amercadia."
": Yeah, that's true, keep the other guys away from us."
: Do we think that there's any chance that the Guernican Art Squad
"though, could be talked into going for the corporation, or-"
: That's such good a call.
": You know, like I feel like if they wanna be edgy, like they should fucking go after the corporation."
: We've got a team of people who can send emails on the dial.
: The most mainstream thing to do would be to go after-
: We can appeal-
: Don't we have some reviewers in our JibJob space? Can't we have them review the Guernican Art Squad?
: The show?
: You could.
": Everyone's attacking us, you sure you wanna copy them?"
": Yeah, just mass Yelp review."
: Yeah.
": Mass Yelp reviewing, Guernican Art Squad."
"Ally: Oh yeah, so to Jan I'm like, please hang back and do exactly what you're doing, you guys have been great."
": Cool, in that case, Jan is going to wheel back around and face down these other Brigade Tigers back over here and is gonna take some attacks there. Hell yes. Okay, that's 24... The Lady Pike wheels around, blasts two of the, it's actually gonna turn around and blast two of the Guernican Tigers out of space."
Ally: Great. Can I put on-
: What if they're dying?
: Can I put the Guernican Art Squad and Jan in conversation with each other and just kinda sit there and watch them talk?
": Yeah. (all laughing) Yeah. Arcadia, Arcadia Prime appears, boom. A green ship with a fanged fish on the front, nautical theme. How derivative. I'm gonna put my cigar out in your eye. (all laughing) You see-"
": Wow, incredible."
Siobhan: This is what we needed.
: This is what we needed.
"Ally: If I, yeah."
": Okay, so actually Lamelia and Dan Scrap also both engage with Guernica along with those Roid Removers there. I'm gonna say, give me a, having asked for that, just give me a d20 roll as like a group attack roll for your U4F friends going up against Guernica. You want a high number here."
: Okay. (die clatters)
: What's that?
Brennan: Is that a nat one?
: Yeah.
: Oof.
: With a- All right.
: So many nat ones this battle.
Brennan: Next up are the Vercadian Protector Droids flanking your vessel.
Emily: Okay.
"Brennan: Okay, you see Veep 909 turns over here, goes, Sidney."
": Yeah, Veep?"
: What would you like?
": You, but I can't have that right now, so."
: Spicy. (all laughing)
": Before this, I was all mommy issues and I'm finally moving on past that so, ready for the next phase."
": You see, yeah, Veep 909 basically-"
": Yeah, I think take out all these UFTP fighters because I don't, I would say take out maybe, like, take them out because I don't want Griivarr to burst at us and then us to be caught up in that."
": Got you, yes, yes, that makes perfect sense."
: Do you think that we want these Vercadian Protector Droids to try to get on the UFTP ship that Riva's on? Or do we just wanna try and take out-?
": Let's take out the little guys, 'cause they-"
: Okay.
: These like giant ships have so many people on them.
: Yeah.
": Wow, that's bad."
": If we can just get Barry Nyne's head in the game, we'll have an extra gunner."
": So Emily, could you do me a favor? I'm gonna ask you to roll the damage for these Vercadian Protectors. Could you go ahead and roll 4d6 plus eight damage?"
": Yes, I could. (dice clatter) Uh... 14! Oh, wait, 4d8 plus what? Three?"
Brennan: Plus eight.
: 4d6 plus 8.
: 4d6 plus 8.
: So I got 14 plus 8. 22.
": 22, incredible. So we're gonna go ahead right here, none of the UFTP fighters go down. (lasers firing) However, they look badly injured, or they look at least like the shields have been chewed through on all of them, and they're now taking hull point damage. As the Vercadians fly through, the Vercadians are also gonna take 200 feet of movement accompanying the Wurst forward towards the command ship. That is the Vercadians' turn. Now, it's gonna be... Griivarr. The entire Griivarr fighter squadron is going to move forward. How many of them are there? Oh God, there's like nine of them. Okay, the entire Griivarr fighter squadron is gonna take fire on the UFTP fighters."
"Zac: Yes. (Emily laughs) Incredible. I am going to ask every one of you here to roll some attacks for now your Griivarr allies, they're still at long range so they're rolling disadvantage. I want you to let me know, we're gonna simplify this down damage-wise. Normally to hit, these guys have a plus six. Let me know if the- If the lower of the two dice is an eight, it's a hit. Let me know if the lower of your two dice is a 15 or higher. Cool?"
: Lower is 15? Okay
"Brennan: Yeah, go ahead and roll. We're rolling disadvantage."
": I got a three and a seven. Oh, that's so sad."
: My lower is a nine.
"Brennan: Okay, that's a hit."
: Three and a five.
Brennan: Three and a five.
: Lower's a two.
Brennan: A two.
": Oh, we're all doing this?"
"Brennan: All doing it, yeah."
: My lower is a seven.
": Urgh, one as well."
"Brennan: Okay, one of the- The ones that the Vercadians lit up, so UFTP fighter ship number five- (mimics explosion sound) Goes up. The rest are all misses from that long distance as Griivarr starts flying in. The command ship is now going to go, and I think the command ship's gonna fire on the other command ship."
Murph: Whoa.
Emily: Whoa.
: Command ship to command ship combat?
: Are they saying anything to them? Like could we hear from Riva?
": Yeah, gimme a scan check if you want."
"Emily: Oh, yeah, we wanna know what's-"
": Oh wait, you're aboard their ship."
": I'm aboard their ship, yeah."
": You hear them announcing, you see all of- Actually, let me roll, that's one of their actions. Okay, that is a successful interfere check from the Griivarr command ship, which jams the comms for the UFTP command. So all over this United Free Trade Planets command ship, (comms blipping) appearing everywhere you see a roaring little fireplace, some beautiful stuffed animals, and a very friendly-looking man lean in and say, Hey there pals, it's Uncle Bob. Looks like you were trying to leverage your market position with some sort of backroom dealing to come after me and my enterprises, that I left to my wonderful kids and all the amazing people on the Griivarr worlds. I hate to say it; that's gonna be a big no-no from your old Uncle Bob. And you see these huge lasers charge up, and Assault Turbo lasers are going to fire. Oh, look at that attack!"
Ally: Oh my God.
"Brennan: Okay, so that's an interfere, they still have their attack. I believe this is still long range for them, 'cause it's not within 1200 feet. Okay, so this is gonna be some- I'm gonna tell you guys right now, normally I'm like simplifying a lot cause I don't wanna jam up combat with all this other stuff, other people are doing. This I'm gonna roll in front of the board because these are, the stakes could not be bigger for these command ships going after each other. So this is still disadvantaged for long range. I'll let you know right now, this thing hits- Oh God, their armor class is so low. It's gonna hit the other command ship on a four or higher. So it's rolling disadvantage... That's a 16 on the lower-"
: Yeah.
: And a five still does it! Five still hits.
Ally: Oh my gosh.
": Oh my God, that is going to be... from the Griivarr command ship to the UFTP command ship with two assault turbo lasers. (mimicking turbo laser sounds) Incredible, that's Griivarr. UFTP command is going to- God, what the hell are they gonna do? They've got their point defense still active. I'm going to need a strength saving throw from the Wurst as they attempt to hit you with a tractor beam again. You're gonna roll with advantage because their comms are jammed."
: Yes.
Zac: Okay.
Lou: Thank God.
Zac: 17.
Brennan: Passes. (Siobhan sighs)
"Brennan: Tractor beam fails, as you see the Griivarr hacking, boom, hit their comms, you dodge outta the way of their tractor beam, they are not gonna risk hitting your wounded ship knowing that they need what is on board, but they are going to roll twice to hit the Griivarr ship. That is a miss on the lower die, unreal. And that is a hit. the Griivarr Command Ship from United Free Trade Planets as they return fire with an assault laser."
: Geez.
: You're seeing why these guys fighting each other has radically changed what these turns feel like.
: Big time.
": Gust Weatherall's command ship is not only going to move forward 300 feet, I'm gonna ask Talespire to also move it up vertically, so that it can get clearance to fire twice on the Wurst."
: What was the Gust Weatherall coverup? What was that-
: It was his poisoned champagne.
": With UFTP. No, I know that, but how did UF- how did the UFTP-"
: I don't think UFTP had anything to do with it.
": Yeah, I think the only dirt we have on him is that like, he..."
": We just know it from, uh, Skip's brain."
: Yeah.
"Brennan: You know that he like betrayed the brigade. You know that he, like, betrayed his own-"
": Yes, maybe we can get his people to mutiny-"
": Yeah, I think that's the whole-"
"Siobhan: Is, is like our option here."
": Yeah, the officers were all making faces."
Emily: Yeah.
: All right.
": You're right, and then I rolled a nat one and they went hah, nevermind. (Emily laughs) Nevermind, I get college paid for."
": Okay, they're gonna use an action to cool down their assault turbo laser, and then they're gonna fire twice."
: I will use Colonian Turn. Do we have power dice?
Lou: We do.
": To try to get some of these little UFTP ships in the way, like get behind some of them."
"Brennan: Okay, copy that. So you'll use Colonian Turn and get some of these UFTP, that's gonna give you partial cover, so your AC is gonna go up by two, and if it hits that window it might, oh yeah, go ahead and gimme the power die."
": Five, so 250 feet forward."
Ally: Nice.
: Amazing.
": Like, yeah, I guess a little angled to the left so I can get in front."
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Zac: Get ships in the way.
: So the Wurst is gonna as a reaction go 250 feet kind of like dipping under or over that little cloud of Vercadians.
: Like nine and three of UFTP.
"Brennan: Yes, exactly."
Zac: If possible.
: Just getting stabbed in this stomach.
"Brennan: Just still, yeah, steering forward as fast as possible."
: Yikes.
": Okay, this is gonna be Box of Doom. Your AC goes up by two."
: Okay.
": Because these fighter ships are not as large as the other ships you were using for cover, right?"
Siobhan: Yes.
: So your AC is effectively a 17.
Zac: Okay.
Siobhan: Alright.
": This ship has a plus seven to hit, so it hits on a 10 or higher, it gets two attacks, but it's rolling with disadvantage. We're gonna roll in the box of doom. (Brennan blows on dice) (dice roll)"
Siobhan: Beef it.
: Okay. (tense music swells)
Brennan: 17 and nine.
": Oh, that's just a miss-"
": Misses by one, which means-"
Ally: It hits?
": It hits one of the UFTPs. (Emily cheers) That colonian turn puts you, as you- (imitates motors)"
: Incredible guys.
Brennan: Absolutely.
": Oh my God, the girls."
: The girls at the soda shop.
": Talespire, UFTP fighter ship number four gets fried by an Amercadian hyon beam."
Siobhan: Okay.
Brennan: Unbelievable.
": All right, now we're cooking with gas."
": Now we are cooking with gas. The last faction to go, at least out here in space combat, is gonna be Guernica."
": Again, wouldn't it be so random-"
"Ally: Yeah, if you-"
: If they just didn't kill us?
: Attacked Amercadia?
": Why do they even wanna kill us? Oh, they want no Gnosis to make their randomization machines."
Brennan: You guys want a low number.
Lou: One.
Ally: Do we?
": 10, the Guernicans chew through the roid removers."
Ally: That's so random.
: Our old friends.
": The Guernican fighters chew through the roid removers and begin to, then they take their full movement, after using their action to fight, to pursue the Wurst. So the Guernicans are gonna come after you, those Guernicans tigers are, at least. The Guernican command ship has to use its speed to reorient itself here, and now it is going to use its, uh, some more of its weapons, ba bum. It's gonna try to recharge that."
": It's like Hungry, Hungry Hippo and we're the marble."
: (laughs) But also we turned a couple hippos against-
Brennan: But it's gonna activate its point defense.
Lou: Okay.
: If they were just like-
Lou: I don't like when anyone does that.
"Brennan: They're gonna activate their point defense, and they actually are gonna take some shots on you guys."
: Oh.
: Come on.
: That's derivative.
": I hope that they just like spray paint us, which actually is gonna be a problem for Acme Ashmun."
": Honestly, pretty rad if-"
: Don't they realize that-
: They do spray paint us.
": The Amercadians shot on us,"
Brennan: That's a miss. and they're kind of just doing the same thing that they did?
: So derivative.
: The imperialism that they absorbed.
: Derivative!
": Wow, yes."
": Six plus seven... My God, they missed twice! What the hell?"
: Almost like they're incompetent.
": Okay, back on board the Wurst, Barry Nyne, who I believe is not stunned, but he is frightened, right?"
: Frightened.
": Does he have to run, or does he just get disadvantage on everything?"
": Let me open up my panic grenade, I think it's just like disadvantage on everything."
": Cool. Cool, cool, copy that."
": I took pictures of it, hold on. Panic grenade is, um, at the start of the affected- Oh, at the start of the creature's turn it can repeat the save."
": Gotcha, okay, fails again."
": Okay, but it doesn't say anything about running, yeah."
": So this is just gonna be disadvantage, he can't move closer to you, so-"
": Barry, are you-"
: Do you have the slug in your head?
: You killed all the Barrys!
: I didn't kill anyone!
": You did! (yelling, mimicking gun shots) I'm gonna need- You are no longer stunned, but I'm gonna need two dexterity saving throws from you."
: Nice.
": You do those with advantage, right?"
": Do- Oh, I see them, yes."
": Yes, absolutely. ♪ Highway to the danger zone ♪"
Murph: Barrys fighting Barrys.
: So much Barry. ♪ It's the Fang of Frangus ♪
: Dirty 20 on the first one.
: Cool.
: Nat 20 on the second one.
Siobhan: Yes!
: Metal dice.
Siobhan: Freaking metal!
": I guess I'm, I'm fully converted."
"Brennan: 19, 26... to 17, halved again by being in the zone. Oh no, you came out of being in the zone, right?"
: Did I?
": Yes, cause you got knocked out."
: You got knocked out.
: Ugh.
: But you got up again.
"Brennan: So you save for half, that 17 points of damage."
": 17 Points of damage, okay, I'm going to use my reaction to regain a hit die."
Brennan: Hell yeah.
: And look at-
: It's almost like you're pissing the night away. (all laughing)
": I drink a coffee drink, I make a matcha drink. I drink a matcha drink, I drink a matcha drink."
": Sweet, I get nine back."
Lou: What songs are these?
"Brennan: Hell yeah Incredible, Barry unloads."
": What are you- Barry, what are you doing?"
": You're Barry Nyne, I'm Barry Syx. You swapped memories with me!"
": No, no, no!"
": Yes, you did!"
: Maybe I did? What?
: If you're the right Barry then I'm the wrong Barry and I know I'm not the wrong Barry 'cause I would never do-
: No Barry did this!
: I would never do it.
": Prilbus did this! No Barry did this, no Barry did this!"
": You, with some incredible moves, you have- How much damage did you guys take that last turn, any?"
": Zero, wait, wait, we might have taken some."
: We took some.
: 74.
: We still have 13 shields and 25 hull points.
"Brennan: I'm afraid you do not have 13 shields, you have 18 shields."
: Woo!
Brennan: As it become the Wurst's turn again you regain a power die.
: Yes baby.
": Really convenient for me, because-"
: That's what we're talking about.
: Three is really easy to turn into an eight.
": Incredible. The Wurst, it is your turn again. We are going to dive back, I think into miniatures combat first, so that's gonna be Sid and Aurora Nebbins."
Emily: Okay.
"Zac: I definitely say, Zortch is up here!"
: I think I'm gonna dip into miniatures combat as well.
": Okay, copy that, amazing."
": Well, question- how much movement does it take for me to get to the reactor, to the bridge?"
: If you activate your jet packs I think you can get up there at... You would use all of your turn getting to a place in the ship where you could move and be there on the next round.
"Murph: You can wait, 'cause I think we're gonna be in miniature combat for sure."
Lou: Okay.
": Why don't, 'cause I think my initiative is before yours, let's see how this plays out, right?"
"Brennan: Let me actually ask Talespire real quick. While- We'll resolve theirs, I'm gonna ask Talespire for a measurement. Talespire, can we get a measurement for using the Wurst like on the miniature scale of the Wurst, going from Gunnie's reactor station up to the bridge."
: And I think how kind of how far everybody is from Skip.
"Ally: Yeah, I would like to know how far I am also from my WeWork- Jib Job."
"Brennan: Copy that, I think the WeWork might be the farthest, so Talespire, let me know if you've confirmed that request, but it'd be great to have some measurements for Margaret, Gunnie, and for Sid and Syx on how far it would take them to get there. Cool. So you guys are in combat with Barry Syx, what are you guys gonna do?"
: With Barry Syx?
": With Barry Nyne, sorry."
"Emily: I kinda wanna get outta here though, I wanna try and go to the bridge because like we're on the comms, we heard-"
Murph: Yeah.
: Him get attacked. If our pilot fucking dies-
: Zortch is stabbing me!
: It's a huge deal.
": ""Zortch is stabbing me."""
"Brennan: Cool, cool, cool."
: So I guess the question is what is the distance to get there?
": Measurement is incoming, does anyone know what they're doing before that? Riva, you're on another ship right now."
": Yeah, I know exactly what I'm doing."
": Riva, let's hear it."
": I am going to swim as close to the bridge as I can which- I don't have to be that close to it, because we're in space and my area of effect spells are at times 10 in space."
: Unbelievable.
": And I am going to cast psychic repulse, which is a third level spell. Each creature within normally 20 feet, so space a dexterity saving throw within this UFTP ship."
Brennan: Okay.
": And on a failed save, they take 8d6 force damage and are pushed back five feet, on a successful save they take half damage."
": Okay, so... You are going to-"
": Now, how strong are the little wieners that work in this ship? How many hit points does Lucienne have?"
": Sorry, it's a 200 foot... Radius?"
: Radius sphere.
: Interesting.
": 20- Each creature within 20 feet must make a dexterity saving throw, so 200 feet."
": Okay, so. You are going to cast this, it affects everyone within 200 feet of you."
": Within 200 feet of me, yes."
": And that would be okay, how do I?"
": It's kinda nice 'cause, like, you could really-"
: They might save their dex- They might make their dex throws.
: Okay.
: And I might roll very badly.
: It's true. Why don't you go ahead and roll damage for me?
": Great, can I have three more d6s?"
": Here we are, three."
: Great.
"Ally: Ooh, sorry."
": I'll take one from each of you, that's a nice balance. There we go, beautiful little balance."
: Take care of my son.
: My son!
: My son.
": I'll take, I promise to take care of your son."
: Okay...
: Principal Wilson.
": It's been so nice to meet you guys, I hope you all come for the fair."
": 10, I didn't roll great."
Brennan: Cool.
: 22 damage... from me.
": Okay, 22 damage, so I'm gonna roll for... I'm gonna roll for different suites on the ship and what kind out of saving throw is it?"
: It's a dexterity saving throw.
": Okay, so if they get plus three to this, your DC is 16 so they want thirteens or higher."
": Yeah, I need to do Heighten spell on this so that they have to roll with disadvantage. (Brennan sighs)"
": Engineering... It's a 19 and an eight, they fail. Weapons... Weapons saves. Lower of the two is a 13. Pilot... Lower of the two is a six. Communications... Lower of the two is a three. So weapons system stays online. On the bridge crew, a sufficient number of engineering staff, comm staff, and piloting staff are knocked unconscious aboard the ship. Aboard UFTP, absolute chaos as, in the middle of their water system, bubbles burst in all directions as hundreds of United Free Trade Planets officers and soldiers... Like being shaken inside of a snow globe, just- Just scatter across the ship. Carnage. Unbelievable carnage from this incredibly sweet Aguatunisian."
"Riva: Sorry! Not personal, I'm sure you're just doing your job."
": So the ship's speed is reduced to zero, it loses its communications, and engineering staff drops, its weapons staff are still there, like off to the side in different gunning ports and stations, but, holy crap. Incredible."
Lou: What about that thing?
Brennan: Hmm?
"Lou: The thing, the red thing that made the terrain hard and stuff."
: Oh yes.
": All right, I will roll a save at disadvantage for this."
Siobhan: Great.
Brennan: I'll roll in front of the board. You want the lower of the two to be a 12. Or lower. That's a three. Point defense deactivates.
: Woo! (Lou mimics revving an engine)
": We're gonna mow this lawn, baby."
"Brennan: Incredible, Riva, any bonus actions from you?"
": You know, I don't think I have anything, any bonus action that I would wanna do is a spell that I can't do because I just did that."
": By the way, two points of hull damage to the UFTP command from psychic repulse."
": Yeah, I don't know, maybe I can use my bonus action to like listen in on the bridge, is that-?"
"Brennan: Yeah, gimme perception."
: Great.
Ally: Yes. (upbeat music)
: 21.
": Roger that, Princeps, we are opening the bay right now. Sorry, a number of our staff are immediately dead. Just hold one second, I actually don't have a boss anymore, one moment please. And you..."
: All these boss-less babies.
"Brennan: You also, I will say this, reach out on that perception check, you don't think Lucienne's aboard this ship."
: Thank God.
": I did wanna take down Lucienne, but."
: So toxic.
: It'd be suck to lose- It would suck to lose your friend.
Brennan: That's Riva.
": It'd suck to lose your friend. Yeah, exactly."
: Any other-
: That you give little kisses to.
: It is 250 feet from where you are to the bridge.
"Lou: Alright. Cap, good luck! (laughing)"
Murph: What about me and-
"Brennan: Talespire, if we can also get measurements, Talespire, from the gunner pods to the bridge and from the Jib Job space to the bridge-"
": Can you, with your engineering-"
: That would be great.
: Make the bridge so cold...
"Brennan: Zac, let's go to you. What are you doing in this moment?"
: So I am locked in this room with Zortch.
Brennan: You are locked in this room with Zortch.
Zac: Who has stabbed me. Several times.
: Who has stabbed you.
": I think I have to let go of the controls or I just go down after I move once. So, um... It's the start of a new turn, right?"
": It is the start of a new turn, that's correct."
": I'm going... to disengage, let go of the ship, the controls, reaction disengage, roll back and bonus action hide."
: Give me a stealth check.
": Okay. To, like, jump behind, like..."
"Brennan: Yeah, go for it, for sure."
: That is... ...a 16. (dice rolling)
: You hide. You are not sure if you are visible or not.
"Zac: Well, do I roll with advantage or not if I try to attack?"
": If you try to attack, if you try to attack, well, you had a 16 on your stealth?"
": I mean, if you can tell me after the fact, or-"
"Brennan: I will say this, yeah, go ahead and roll with advantage, yeah."
": Okay, so... Well, first off I'm gonna angle perception."
Brennan: Cool.
: So it's my perception versus their sleight of hand.
: Cool.
: So I got...
: 26? Amazing.
": Okay, so they'll have disadvantage on a saving throw."
: Cool.
": Or, yeah, yeah."
": You succeed- On a 26, you succeed."
: Okay.
: Gunner pods is 260 feet.
: I think I can get us there.
": Yeah, I gotta deal with Barry. I think I can-"
": Okay, nevermind then."
": But if you get there, that's good."
": So if the check succeeds, the first attack roll the target makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage, and the first saving throw the creature makes before the start of your turn has disadvantage."
": Sorry, gimme that one more time."
: So the first attack the Princeps makes will have disadvantage and the first saving throw they make will have disadvantage.
": Amazing, perfect, perfect."
": So I'm gonna try to pop up and take a sneak attack, with my cryo cell blaster on this."
Siobhan: Yes.
Murph: Shit.
: Amazing.
Zac: Piece of shit.
: Amazing.
Murph: Wow.
": Okay, so that is a... (dice clatter) At least... At least a 21, but with my supreme accuracy I can re-roll one of those, see if I got- Yeah. At least a- So a 21 to hit."
: A 21 to hit?
Zac: Yeah.
: 21 hits.
": Okay, so I will roll a d6, plus... Five, plus three- Okay, so I have three sneak attack dice plus the blaster die plus five."
: Amazing.
: And this will be... now...
: Plus targeted strike.
: Okay.
: Plus targeted strike.
": I don't have to be able to see you, it's just when an ally makes an attack I can expend a superiority die. So you could hit the 20 cold damage."
: Six.
Emily: Woo!
: 23 cold damage.
": And then there's the d4- I mean, the DC 14 constitution save."
: Isn't it DC 15?
: This is specifically for the cryo cell.
: For the cryo cell.
: And that does that freeze the-?
": It slows them, but, well, it's another d4 of cold damage."
": Another d4 cold damage, incredible."
: And this is with disadvantage.
": This is a saving throw with disadvantage, amazing. First of all, 23 points of cold damage."
: Yeah.
: Prilbus looks at you through Zortch's eyes. Uncanny dodge.
Lou: Ohhhh.
: So that becomes-
: 11.
: 11?
: 11 points of cold damage.
"Siobhan: Damn. This is a saving throw with disadvantage, correct?"
: Yes. (shakes dice)
: Two elevens.
": I don't know what they add to that, it's a con save."
: And the con save- What's the DC on it? It's your DC?
: DC 14 is what the cryo cell.
Emily: Unless it's me.
: Failure.
Zac: Okay.
: Yeah.
": So another d4 of- Two more cold damage, so that was 13 cold damage."
"Brennan: 13, correct."
: And they are slowed.
"Brennan: So you- (yelps) You see the terror in- 'Cause it's a cryo cell. You have more of these, right? Or do you, or no?"
Zac: It's just the cell.
: It's a power cell.
": It's a power cell, got you. Prilbus looks terrified, they're looking at you. (heavy breathing)"
"Zac: I am home, Prilbus. (Brennan laughing)"
: Incredible.
"Emily: Oh my God, calling your dad by his first name. (laughing)"
": Oh, brutal."
: Okay... That's amazing.
": Fuck, uncanny dodge, I should have known."
": Uncanny dodge is a reaction, right? You can't use it multiple times?"
Siobhan: No.
": You do 13 points of damage, they make a save, they're slowed. All right, everyone else's turns."
: Okay.
: I think we wanna talk to Barry Nyne first?
: I'm doing ship stuff.
"Brennan: Ship stuff, cool."
": You're with Gnosis, right?"
"Brennan: Margaret, you're"
: I'm gonna see how things shake out.
Brennan: Cool.
": I wanna see how things shake out, I'm either gonna deal with Barry Nyne or run with Sid towards..."
"Brennan: Cool, amazing."
Emily: Yeah.
": All right, so Barry Nyne is in front of you screaming at you."
": No Barry did this, Barry Nyne or Barry Syx. Truly, this has all been a mindfuck."
: Zortch showed me the video!
: I- Did you ever have a slug in your head? Do you remember that? Do you remember having a weird dream?
": Yeah, I've been having a weird dream ever since yesterday when the video showed me that you were Barry Nyne, I'm Barry Syx, and you made me believe that I was Barry Nyne, but I'm not Barry Nyne, 'cause the video is Barry Nyne killed everybody at Uncle Bob's Fantanimalland, which-!"
": Barry! We're Barry! We're just Barry, Barry! And the Barrys are gone, and there's been too many Barrys fighting Barrys! We're Barry! It doesn't matter if I'm Barry Nyne, or you're Barry Nyne, or I'm Barry Syx or you're Barry Syx! Barry didn't do this. Barry didn't kill the Barrys. What we should be happy about is that there's Barrys here now! Because they're used to just be Barry. There were Barrys, and then there was Barry, and now there's Barrys again, Barry."
": Go ahead, I want you to roll me a persuasion check with advantage, and for this roll you are going to have expertise, 'cause you are expert in nothing more-"
: Than being a Barry.
: Than being a Barry! This is the thing you know. This is the thing you know best in the world.
: Okay.
: You know what it is.
: You know what it is.
: You know what it is.
Ally: You know what it is.
: You know what it is!
": Ooh, baby."
": Okay, so this is charisma, plus- Okay..."
: Barry? I've been really scared for a long time.
": I've been scared too, Barry."
": I missed you, Barry."
": I miss you, Barry."
": And you see- Comes in for a huge hug. I don't know what's happening, I just don't want to hurt anybody."
": Barry, we gotta hurt the people that hurt the Barrys."
: I wanna hurt somebody.
: Let's get in the zone.
": Get in the ZONE! ♪ Highway! ♪ For the first time, when you put on your sunglasses, another Barry puts on his sunglasses as well."
": And Barry, I gotta tell you, there's a few more Barrys here. I pass some sunglasses to-"
": And I go, that's right you fucking idiots. Get on! (Barrys laughing) I put the sunglasses on, I cast Tactical Advantage on Aurora Nebbins, which means that she can get us there. She has now a hundred speed, cause it doubles her speed."
: Incredible.
": So she can and she can also take a second action to dash. So she can dash, then take that bonus action to get extra close, to get us right up to the thing."
: 250...
: And then I still have a bonus action and a reaction to throw some grenades once we can open that door.
": In-credible. So all three of you, Sid, you are sandwiched in between two enormous clone men that are identical."
: We're all holding each others' waists.
Brennan: All holding each others' waists. I love this dog!
: It's a beautiful dog.
: Beautiful dog! And Aurora-
: Her name is also Barry!
": Oh, wow! We're all Barry! And Aurora Nebbins shoots through the ship as you like pop an adrenal dart out of your gun arm. Little Kublacaine-"
": This is safe for dogs, right?"
"Brennan: Aurora Nebbins rockets through the ship, getting you to the doors, getting you to the locked doors of the ship."
": So I'm saving, I have a bonus action and a reaction to throw cryo grenades, but if you two can muscle open this door?"
": Sweet, should we just- You think we can just pull this apart?"
: Do I think you can just pull this apart?
": Me and- Two Barrys, both in the zone."
: Both in the zone.
: Double door Barry?
": I'm just picturing you guys, just like- (grunts)"
"Brennan: We're gonna roll 4d20, gonna roll 4d20- It's- I'm gonna call this a DC..."
: Okay.
Brennan: A DC 27 athletics check.
": Do they both have to hit it, or just one of them have to?"
: Only one. Only one of these dice has to hit a DC 27.
: So we have plus 11.
: You just need a 16 or higher on one of these dice.
"Lou: This is sick as hell, dude."
: (gasps) I didn't do it.
: And neither did Barry Nyne.
Murph: Noo!
: Urgh!
": Wait, but you guys have two attack actions."
": I think this is an ability check, so this is an action ability check- (grunts) As they try to open the door up."
": Okay, Aurora Nebbins has an action. Can she try to do something?"
": Aurora Nebbins does not have an action, 'cause she- She would have to use action, move and a bonus action, 'cause you guys were two-"
": No, because she has- She essentially has Haste on her, so she still has an extra action that she can use to attack."
": Oh, okay, great."
: That's what Tactical Advantage is.
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely, so go ahead and make an attack roll for Aurora Nebbins."
": Okay, I actually don't know, it doesn't say on her sheet what she adds to attack."
": I- There should be a sheet that has that, but if there's not, I'll tell you right now. It's a plus six."
": Okay, so she would have, she can't hit it then."
": No, she could hit it. She could hit it. It's more about how much damage-"
: She got a 19.
"Brennan: Okay, she hits the door."
": Plus six, so 25."
": She hits the door. Now you're gonna roll damage, which is 1d12. The door has eight- The problem is the damage threshold on the door, it's a steel blast door on a starship. It's a damage threshold of hit it on an 11 or 12 on that d12."
: She doesn't add anything to her d12?
": Oh, she adds-"
": Oh it's 15, right?"
"Brennan: Yeah, it adds a plus four."
: 12! (yelling)
"Brennan: Unbelievable, okay. Unbelievable. Okay, so she hit a 12, plus 4 is 16. The door only has 30 hit points so she deals more than half of the door's health in damage."
": You can throw a little hole in there, right?"
": Yeah, is there like enough of a hole that I could throw in cryo grenades?"
": Yeah, you can throw in some grenades, yeah."
": Bonus action- 'Cause it's per round, right?"
": Yeah, this is still the same round."
Murph: It's still the same round.
": Yeah, so it's still the same round."
": That's good, then we can add to get to 20."
: I forgot that I didn't add the...
": So you guys (strains) are pulling the door. In that thing, Aurora Nebbins sees like a weird little cranny where maybe there could be turtles, and goes- (snarls) and you see, just pulls like- In her weird external teeth, there's just like wires, and- (growls) Pulling them out of the door."
": ""A weird little cranny where there may be turtles. Nyah!"""
": Honestly, on our ship, there probably are a couple."
": Yeah, definitely."
: You see a bunch of tortoises rush out of the middle of the doors.
": And then I'm gonna throw in two cryo grenades and because it's explosives, because I've already manifested my Explosives Style, it's a DC 16 con save."
: Incredible.
Murph: Nice.
": Because of where the blast doors are on the bridge, I'm going to say you're like hucking these in."
": I also still have my movement, so-"
": Unfortunately you can't- It's only big enough for you to, like, launch them into the room. So I'm gonna give Zortch advantage on these saves because you are having to like angle the grenades around a corner, like, ricochet them off a wall around the corner."
: Mm-hm.
": Two saves coming up. They've already taken 13 points of cold damage this turn. This could be everything. All right, DC is 16, Zortch is adding plus four to this, That's a 16, makes that save. so it's half damage."
: They still take half damage.
: So you need to do 14 damage.
Zac: Or seven?
"Siobhan: No, yeah."
Brennan: Halved.
: Why is it halved?
": Because they made the saves both times, right?"
": Oh, okay, so I got nineÔÇª I hit 14 exactly."
: Oh. My. God.
: Get out of my friend's nose.
": So, you're standing there- You see Zortch looking at you, Prilbus looks at you and he goes, Trying to freeze me out of your friend's mind? I don't- (pling sounds) As you hear growling at the door- Bo-boom! Zortch goes, Cold! Brain freeze! (intense sneeze) And a slug rockets out, rockets out of Zortch's head. Zortch goes, oh, I don't feel good. You see a huge welt on the side of Zortch's head where Barry Nyne clocked them, knocked them unconscious. Incredible, so- That's amazing, okay. That's all the minis going that round. We have Margaret and Gunnie, who are the only people acting on behalf of the ship right now."
: Is there any ship stuff that would be helpful for me to do? I mean- You know.
": I, you know- Find the..."
Lou: Gunnie wants to try-
Siobhan: Find Lucienne?
: And do something crazy.
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah."
: I'll probably text Lucienne.
: There's no one at the helm of this ship.
": Correct, correct, yes."
": What is the nature of, uh- (Emily giggles) Micro FTL jumps and using Gnosis to make one? (slow tempo music)"
": Yeah, what's their nature?"
: What's the nature of that?
: What's the nature of it?
: What is... the nature of it?
: What is the nature-
: (bad English accent) What is the nature?
Lou: Of micro FTL jumps?
: You wanna take a big risk?
: Yes.
: Do you know who you're talking to?
: Have you played an entire season with this motherfucker?
: Gunnie has two hearts right now.
": Two hearts, can't lose."
": Talk to me. Make up some insane rigmarole so I can say yes to it, please."
Murph: Oh no.
: Where would we be micro-jumping to?
": About 25- About 2.700 feet on the other side of the, uh, U-"
Ally: That's right.
": The, uh, the ship- The..."
: You wanna go from here to 2.700 feet on-
Lou: On the other side of the United Free Trade Planets' ship.
"Siobhan: Basically, so I can still get back to the ship."
Brennan: I'm gonna say this- if you can clear 10 equations in a single round... You can make that FTL jump.
"Lou: Mm-hm. [Brennan] If you come short, for every equation that you come short making that jump, it's gonna be 1d20 damage to the hull."
: But could be a one.
"Siobhan: To the hull? No, no, no, no, come on."
: We have 25 hull points.
": Yeah, we can't take that."
": I'm using Gnosis? Or- I'm using Gnosis, and is that, uh-"
": So the way this is gonna work is like this, right? You need a bunch of completed equations."
: Yeah.
: Gnosis has a plus 20 to astrogation checks.
: Okay.
": So Gnosis will make some, and you will have to make the rest."
: Okay. Let's do it.
"Ally: Wait, it's- Hold on, hold on."
Siobhan: How many is some?
: You're rolling for you get to 10 equations?
": 10 Equations- It's three for everything over 20. So for every one Gnosis hits, Gnosis just has to not hit a one and they're getting three equations. Or at least two."
: Okay.
: And how many-
Brennan: Here we go. So-
Siobhan: How many is Gnosis-?
: 30- A roll of 30 plus is five completed equations.
: So if Gnosis gets above
: Will you call me before you do this? Will you call me on the comms?
": Sure, you got it."
": For every success you fall short, it will be a d20 of hull damage. Cool?"
: Okay.
: Great.
": And you called me, right? And I know what's-"
": Hey, Margaret? Ah, we gotta get outta here."
": Talk to me, I love it. Any idea you have, I'm down for."
": Yeah, I'm gonna- I'm gonna jump us."
: Uh-huh?
": I'm gonna jump us. I'm just gonna- I'm gonna plug, I'm gonna do the equation, but just plug it, it's just gonna be a shorter, uh, a shorter trip."
: Gunnie?
: We'll pick up Riva. We'll get on the other side. It's gonna be okay.
": Gunnie, I've always believed in you."
": Hey, this is my body, this is my ship, this is my family. We're doing this."
: Great.
Brennan: Okay.
": You have my critical analysis, so you have a plus five to a roll that you need it for."
": Okay, great. Hey, thanks, boss. We- I would love to have our one minute meeting."
": Yeah, we do need- We have our one-on-one that you signed up for, but yeah, then we got taken over."
": Yeah, exactly, so we're gonna get that on the books, I got a lot I wanna say to you, it's all good things. (laughing in the face of uncertainty)"
: This is Gnosis's roll.
Lou: Okay.
: Do you each get one roll?
: Gnosis gets one roll.
: And Gunnie gets one roll.
": Unless you want to give the Direct action, or-"
: Absolutely.
"Brennan: Okay, you give the Direct action to Gunnie, so you're gonna roll with advantage."
"Ally: Okay, cool."
": Here's Gnosis, plus 20 to astrogation checks. Supercomputer, planetary deity. (Zac gasps)"
: Oh my God. What the fuck?
: I rolled a natural two. (Emily wheezes)
": That's okay still, though, right?"
: So that's zero equations?
": Oh no, no, no, no."
": No it's good, it's just- We would've-"
"Siobhan: Three, it's three."
": They can only fail, I think, on a one, but-"
: It really was just so close-
: It came so close.
: To a one.
: But that's three?
: And I can see the 20 staring at me.
"Brennan: Gnosis reaches out and goes, Okay, so what are we sort of doing here? We've got... So that's three completed equations, so-"
: Can you get a Jib Jobber to do SQ-?
"Brennan: If you beat a 30, Gunnie."
Lou: Mm-hm.
: If you beat a 30-
: What do you have added to this?
: 11.
Ally: Okay.
: With including the critical analysis?
: Then it's a 16.
": Okay, so if you beat a 30, you will be able to reduce this to only 2d20 hull damage."
Emily: I'm gonna cry.
": What if a Jib Jobber tries to get SQ to solve one of these problems, also?"
Emily: Oh my God!
"Lou: Can I, can I give-"
: It's all the same turn?
": Never- Uh, can I use a, no."
Brennan: I'm gonna- I'm gonna rule that that is an after-the-fact thought.
: Mm.
": We're gonna, we are-"
": It's interesting how you say that, because I do, I agree."
: So we're gonna roll.
: So you need a 14 or higher.
: This is Gunnie's-
: For us to only take two d20.
: This is Gunnie's check right now.
Ally: Maybe do them one at a time?
: The ball is rolling up.
": No, God, just do it all at once."
: The ball is rolling up.
"Brennan: Oh- Wait, sorry, no, no, we are gonna get Box of Doom out. We're absolutely gonna get Box of Doom out."
Siobhan: Oh God.
Ally: So the higher of these has to be a 14 or higher.
"Brennan: The higher, I mean, if it's- It needs to be-"
": Oh, you have plus 16."
": He has plus 16. I'm just saying the highest- Yes, that's the best possible result. Anything below 14 starts to get bad."
: Can I pass these dice around the table real quick?
"Brennan: Yes, you can."
Emily: Okay.
: As you- (dice smooch)
: As you're doing this- (dice smooch) (dice smooch)
"Zac: Skip radios, My son... (dice smooch)"
"Lou: Yeah, Dad?"
"Zac: You've never, ever done anything wrong. (dice smooch) And I don't think it's gonna happen today."
": And then Sid goes in and says, Oh, Gunnie, it's Barry, and Barry, and also Barry."
: Yeah.
Emily: And another Barry.
: Yeah.
: And we just believe in you so much.
": Hey, thank you. I- I know this is where I'm meant to be, and what I'm meant to do."
: This is gonna suck.
: Can I pull Dan Scrap up on the comms real quick?
": Yes you can. Sorry, what was this real quick?"
Lou: What'd you say?
Brennan: What's that?
": ""This is gonna suck."" (all laughing)"
": The more sentimental we get about it, the worse it's gonna be."
": All right, comms comes up. This is Danielle Scrap of the Bad Call."
": I don't even look up, it's like-"
Ally: Danielle!
": I want you to know I'm making the biggest astro-navigation check of my life, and I'm only in this position because of you, so thanks."
": Well, if I had ever- If I knew who you were, you know, if I..."
: I'm- It's Gunnie.
": What's that? (all laughing) I know it's you, I'm tryna- I've gotta pretend that I'm-"
"Lou: Course you do, okay."
": Yeah. Hey, I appreciate-"
": You made up this person, she could know anyone she wants. (all laughing)"
": Okay, here we go."
": Come on, come on."
": Big money, big money, big money."
Brennan: Here's number one.
Lou: That's a two. (wheezes) (quiet laughing)
Brennan: Now this is-
"Zac: Wait, what does that mean?"
Brennan: It means that if this next-
Ally: It's advantage so this could still save.
Brennan: It could still be good. It could still-
"Zac: Wait, what die are you using?"
": This is the other one that you kissed! This is the Nebula one, Ally got every single one of us one of these."
Brennan: Here we go. Here we go.
Murph: If we all go out-
: I might pass out.
Murph: I'm glad it's together.
: Here we go...
: That's a 14.
Brennan: 14! (screaming)
": That is exactly 30, okay."
: Oh my God.
: Oh. My. God!
Brennan: How many hull points do we have left?
": Well, we could still go down, because we have 25. So with two- You said there's gonna be two, do-"
Brennan: Do you mind?
": You, yes. Are you gonna roll it?"
: I'm gonna roll.
: Fuck that!
: Can I roll it? (laughter)
": Oh yeah! Yeah, yeah."
: It's low.
": No, I don't know. I don't know if I-"
Ally: Two twos?
": I don't know if you roll low, or if you roll unlucky."
Brennan: Do you wanna roll damage?
: I'll roll damage.
Murph: Interesting.
"Brennan: Yeah, all right. It's two-"
: I think Murph should roll it.
": D20. It's two d20. Okay, so we have 25-"
Siobhan: Snake eyes.
: Hull points left.
": Snake eyes, snake eyes, snake eyes!"
: Snake eyes.
: Snake eyes!
": C'mon! Snake eyes, baby."
: Snake eyes.
Ally: Do 'em one at a time-
Brennan: 13 and 3. 16 hull points of damage.
: Yes! (all laughing)
"Siobhan: Oh my God. (all sighing, laughing)"
Brennan: Unbelievable.
": Ladies and gentlemen, we're clocking in at nine hull dice! Sittin' pretty at nine!"
: My son! Father! Son!
": Everybody on board the Wurst, momentarily, you feel a- (sound effect of split second light speed travel) And immediately come out of faster-than- light. It is, you- Literally, less than a mile of faster than light travel. I think many people in the ship probably vomit."
": Yes, I literally in real life might vomit. (all laughing)"
: I can't believe we kicked it off with a two.
: My brain is fizzing right now.
": But you move 2.700 feet, past the UFTP command ship."
: Oh my God.
": God bless ya, Lou."
": You know what? All these other ships are just like, what just happened? And they think that we weren't scared at all."
: Gnosis is absolutely fucking eating it.
: That two.
: That two!
: That two made my fuckin'... feet fall off.
: Which two? The first two or the second two?
Ally: Oh my God.
": The first two, the 20-"
Siobhan: I could punch a wall.
": Yeah, do it, punch a hole on the dome."
: Just like-
: Almost a nat 20?
"Emily: Yeah, just like-"
: It honestly would be so funny to just edge the-
: To crit on yourself. (Siobhan laughing)
": Here's what we could have done, though."
: Just me in an enemy ship-
Emily: We have these Vercadian Protector Droids-
: Floating in space.
": They could have saved us, maybe."
": Okay. Holy shit, all right."
Zac: I'm gonna lay down on the floor.
Brennan: Lay down on the floor?
": ctually, same. Can we train all the cameras just pointing down on me for the rest of the-"
": Can we just do the rest of this underneath the table? Like we're in, like, a little-"
: Like a safe little blanket flort- Fort?
: We are exhausted. (laughter)
": I think I'm gonna have, like, a crying adrenaline dump."
": Yeah, same. Same. (Emily and Ally laughing) Do you wanna hold her?"
"Brennan: Okay, unbelievable. Um... All right, any other actions? Any other actions? Are there any other actions, bonus actions, anything like that?"
"Lou: Margaret, anything you wanna do outside of direct me?"
": I yell, Plastic bag your faces."
": Oh, that's true-"
": Oh, but he's paralyzed."
"Emily: He's paralyzed, yeah."
"Siobhan: Oh, yeah."
: He's paralyzed.
: Plastic bag the worm. Fucking tank that worm.
": I want someone to step on it really bad, but I think that that is-"
": I know, the duty of-"
: It's the duty of the son.
: The duty of the son to kill the father.
: Or do whatever he wants with the father.
: The rules of the House of Frangus.
"Emily: It's your father, you decide."
": Okay, any other actions, bonus actions, anything like that from the crew?"
": I guess, bonus action, I'll turn my critical analysis to Skip."
Brennan: Okay.
": Oh, great."
: I feel insane right now.
Ally: I feel crazy.
": Oh my God, I fucking loved that."
: That was about-
Siobhan: I might fall asleep as soon as the cameras turn off.
": Oh wait, as a full, like, defense mechanism?"
: The adrenaline zone.
": The absolutely wild, bad luck of Gunnie is insane."
Zac: What an arc!
Lou: What an arc.
"Ally: It would have been really funny to crit on our own damage so like I'm- Obviously, thank God, but I'm just like if one of them..."
: I am so glad you're saying that now and not before because my brain would've made it happen.
": After an incredible turn you appear out of FTL boom with tachyon drive, engage your lithium crystal core reactor and see the normally stressful, but now welcoming embrace of an asteroid belt and directly in front of you the Fang of Frangus, the satellite you are headed to. I will remind you that the interior mechanisms of the satellite are what you need. You gotta get Gnosis onto that, so this is once again, probably gonna be a split of like micro and macro. You're gonna need some kind of boarding party to grab Gnosis and get on board that ship."
": So looking at this, slugs built this."
Brennan: Yeah.
: But slugs in human bodies-
"Brennan: Yeah, slugs in humanoid bodies."
Siobhan: This isn't gonna just be a weird little wriggley tunnel.
"Brennan: No, no, no, no."
Ally: You're telling me slugs built this?
Emily: I thought for sure we were headed for-
Siobhan: It's really wet-
: Something very different.
Brennan: You're telling me a slug fried this rice? Yeah.
: I feel weirdly like it might be helpful for Skip to be in there.
"Murph: Yeah, I'd think so."
Emily: For sure.
: I can hold it down on the ship.
: Okay.
: I'll be back on the ship next turn.
": We've got two Barrys now, we could go one Barry in one direction, one Barry in the other direction."
: Barry 69?
: Barry 69.
"Brennan: Incredible. Okay, so we're gonna go back to the top of the initiative."
: I just pictured an actual berry.
"Brennan: Okay, our brigade... Okay, Talespire crew, Brigade Tigers are going to... All right, they're gonna gear up, they're done playing around."
: They were playing around?
: They were playing around a little bit. Okay. Brigade Tigers are gonna move 800 feet forward.
: Do any of the Vercadian Protector Droids get opportunity attacks?
"Brennan: Well, that's the Brigade Tigers who are gonna continue to search forward. The UFTP Fighters are going to... What is UFTP gonna tell them to do?"
Zac: But they can't communicate to 'em.
": Oh, yeah, their channels are blocked by-"
Ally: They're jammed.
Murph: By Griivarr.
Siobhan: Griivarr.
": Their comms are blocked, and the last thing they heard from the Wurst was that Zortch was piloting it to the satellite. So there's no reason for them not to believe that everything's going according to plan. (operatic) ♪ I can't feel my face ♪ ♪ when I'm with you ♪"
: You're seeing an off-camera bit.
Murph: This is an off-camera bit.
: It's an off camera bit.
: You have to explain it.
: No.
": If you're ever confused, it's either an off-camera bit, or we're just doing something so stupid that it doesn't make any sense."
: We just all had the opera version of that song stuck in our heads.
"Brennan: So, yeah, UFTP wouldn't- What would UFTP even do? They're not gonna fire on the Wurst."
": Well, I mean, they just got attacked by Griivarr Worlds, I mean, if I was them I'd probably fight back a little bit."
: I'm gonna say that what you guys see as you look behind you... U4F...
": Probably just get a massive fight between the two of 'em, and blow each other up."
"Brennan: Griivarr... Okay. Yeah, behind you, you see UFTP assumes that all's well, and UFTP fighters swarm around the Vercadians as the Griivarr faction- So let's move, the Griivarr command is going to continue to fire on the UFTP command ship. The Griivarr fighters are gonna close in with the UFTP fighters as the Brigade Tigers come in after them, and there's just a swarm of Vercadian Protector Droids and UFTP fighter craft floating in space. Amercadia, number one, the com ship is gonna make a check to unscramble their comms. A tremendous amount of their staff are dead so they're gonna do this with disadvantage."
: UFTP.
": Sorry, UFTP is gonna try to unscramble their comms, and they're gonna do it with disadvantage 'cause a tremendous amount of staff is dead. They need the lower these two dice to be a 12 or higher. That's a seven, not gonna do it. Their comms remain unscrambled, so they're just gonna fire their weapons systems at the Griivarr Command ship coming in."
Siobhan: Great.
": The tigers are coming in as fast as they can. Gust Weatherall's ship is going to, yeah, that Amercadian command ship is going to take four movement actions, so we're gonna move the command ship"
Ally: 12K.
Brennan: It's using all of its actions to pursue the Wurst. (Brennan imitates engines) Let's see how much...
"Zac: Ooh-wee. That is a big, big-"
Lou: And we're still not in there.
Brennan: You are outside of long range of Gust Weatherall's ship for the moment.
"Siobhan: Stunning, stunning."
"Brennan: Incredible, Guernica is gonna do the same thing. You hear over the comms, Arcadia Prime say, Get that hot dog! And the Guernican Tigers are going to disengage from the U4F ships and are gonna start coming after the Wurst, so one movement for the tigers. The Guernican Command ship is gonna do the same thing, it's gonna use four actions to come after the Wurst so it's gonna move 1200 after the Wurst as well. For this, let me get- We're just gonna get an overall combat roll. Margaret, give me a d20 roll for U4F and give me, Sid, a d20 roll for our Vercadians."
": Come on, babies. Four."
Brennan: Okay.
"Ally: U4F is 17, plus whatever they add."
"Brennan: Hell yes, you guys see the Lady Pike, the Bad Call and the rest of the U4F ships that have come into space around you, allow the various Brigade Tigers and Guernican commandeered vessels to disengage, and turn and open fire on Gust Weatherall's Command ship. All four U4F vessels- (imitates laser fire) Begin to lay down fire on Gust's ship. (Ship lasers firing) Let's go ahead of damage to Gust Weatherall's command vessel."
Zac: Okay.
Brennan: From the various U4F ships.
": Go get 'em, Dan."
: Go get 'em Dan.
Lou: Danielle.
Brennan: Danielle.
: Just like a blonde wig.
": Okay. Vercadians, Griivarr."
Siobhan: Maybe he just has a bunch of girl guides on his ship.
Brennan: We don't know.
Siobhan: We don't know.
": We don't know. Um, okay."
"Ally: Hopefully not, honestly, for those girl guides."
Zac: Where are our girl guides?
": Wait, yeah, where are our girl guides?"
: They're playing pinochle in the corner.
Zac: Oh.
: For money or for blood?
": Money or for blood? Yeah, you see Khloe, Malika, and Stacks all in the corner being like, all right, drop, like just going back and forth, smoking big fat cigars having a great time."
": These girls are so cool, I can't knock them."
: They're too cool. They're too cool
": Children that are smoking, that's cool."
": That's cool. Okay, that's gonna be, so unbelievably that jump to hyperspace really did the trick. The jump to FTL really did the-"
: I wonder if it was worth the three years of my life that were shaved off? (all laughing)
"Brennan: Okay, so our ships have moved in closer. Here we go. Unbelievably, after that jump, that's gonna go back to the Wurst. It is once again your turn."
"Ally: Oh my God. You guys, is there anything to driving right past the satellite and sending some of our- Whoever's going there, like, shoot them out in a way, so that we can keep going and it looks like we just pass by, and they can keep chasing us?"
": Yeah, I guess like, here's a question, like- Who is going in, and who isn't?"
: We don't know what's in there.
": Can we get Riva back, before-?"
": Yeah, let me jump back, I'm just, I'm gonna phase walk back into the ship."
Brennan: Amazing.
Siobhan: Hello!
Ally: You did great!
Siobhan: Are you okay? Everybody all right here?
: You killed a lot of people.
"Ally: Yeah, you killed a lot-"
"Siobhan: I killed a lot of people and I don't feel great about it, but-"
": Your dad's just, like, on the ground."
: Your dad is just on the ground.
Zac: So I think.
": I think, I like kind of, I'm like, (whispers) Barrys, let's give them some privacy."
"Zac: I think, uh-"
Emily: So we'll put our sunglasses on to give you privacy.
Brennan: Give me a perception check.
: He should be paralyzed.
": If you'll notice, in the text of the Cerebero slug ability, there is a constitution saving throw involved."
": Oh God, is he Loose Duke-ing?"
": No, no, no, no, no, no."
Murph: Loose Duke confirmed dead in the vents. Incapacitated-
": Incapacitated in the vents, with a slug inside him."
: You got- Come on.
": Perception check, that's a 15."
: Can we give you the help action?
: You can if you want to take your turn to do it.
"Ally: Yeah, I'll do that."
Brennan: You wanna take your turn to give the help action right now?
: Yeah.
"Emily: What is at stake here, I actually don't understand-"
: Maybe we don't know where the dad is.
"Siobhan: I should take my turn, because-"
Zac: 'Cause you just already-
": When I direct- What I just did was a bonus action, when I direct I get extra stuff."
Ally: Cool.
": Riva, you phase walk away from the UFTP. You are back in your bulb of water on the Wurst. You take the direct action, that's your action. Go ahead and roll with advantage. So, you've already rolled once. Roll your second roll. (die clinks)"
Ally: Nat 20!
Zac: Natural 20.
": Oh, yes! Oh, yes."
: Woo! Woo!
: Switched to the Ally die.
"Brennan: Incredible, we love it."
": Which I also got two nat ones on, but we don't have to talk about it."
Siobhan: We don't talk about it.
": You look down. It's a DC 15 constitution saving throw to have the slug not be paralyzed, as it is ejected from the brain. You see a thin trail of slime ducking down into one of the air vents."
Emily: Oh.
Zac: Fuck.
": He's gonna fucking inhabit Loose Duke. I know Loose Duke isn't fucking dead, he's gonna inhabit him-"
Lou: What's going on?
: You up here?
": I don't think so, I think I'm still down in the ship."
: All right.
: They have advantage on sense of smell and one of the Barrys has had it in him.
Zac: Okay.
": I also, I could do a spell to find him, but I need a drink before I do it 'cause I don't- I'm, like, out of force points."
": I'm going to spit myself up into the vent and look at a mirror, find some sort of mirrored surface and say, Skipper, you have the helm, be a hero. And just spit myself up. (Brennan laughing)"
": Incredible. (wet spitting sound) You hit the deck, you no longer have sight or hearing of all these other various bipedal, humanoid senses. You rocket down an air vent. You do have one sense, through the mucus membranes, you taste your father's scent."
: Father.
": And slug after slug, you give chase into the air vents. (all laughing)"
: Since this has been done-
": Wait, when-"
": Before, can I send Handy Annie to escort the slug, so that maybe you can be faster?"
: Can I give him a tiny little dagger if I make it really quick?
Emily: A toothpick! You probably have a toothpick.
": A luck check for sort of a doll house, sharp-"
": Incredible, this is incredible. Okay, so Norman Takamori is suddenly once again on the deck. Okay, you are chasing that. Handy Annie crawls into the air vent with Skip to give a help action."
Emily: Yeah.
": Amazing, okay, that's your turn, so you are getting chased, you can sense yourself getting closer and closer to your father- You can you feel through the slime."
: Prilbus...
: Prilbus. Valdrinor! Incredible.
: Oh my God.
: You've used your action and bonus action.
Siobhan: Yes.
": You are taking a full dash after your father, you're like just barreling down the air vent after him, Handy Annie is gonna give you advantage. I'm actually gonna say Handy Annie is going to allow you to like catch up to your, yes."
: I was figuring that Handy Annie is so much faster than a slug that you could.
Brennan: Handy Annie is gonna help you catch up to your father.
": A very inconsequential story thing, could I have done before I jumped out of my body?"
"Brennan: Yes, absolutely."
": I, when I looked in the mirror to talk to Skipper, I was like, give what's in my left pocket to Gunnie."
": Incredible, the slug leaves, but I believe as the slug leaves, I think Norman has an action, has a bunch of actions and bonus actions and stuff as well."
": Uh, Norman cries and looks around like, he's bleeding really badly."
": Oh, from being stabbed in the stomach?"
"Emily: Hi, Skipper."
: Argh...
: We're in the biggest battle of our life and we're also millionaires.
": Oh, that's good. What do I do, what do you want? What should I do?"
: What you should do if you wanna get in on this is keep driving towards that.
"Zac: I don't want to get, okay- I didn't do anything wrong, and just drives forward."
": Hell yeah, okay. Is there any other ship stuff happening in terms of driving forward, in terms of other stuff?"
": Hey, I'm gonna dislodge Gnosis. Can you send Aurora down here to bring her up to whoever's gonna be boarding the ship?"
: Yeah.
": Yeah, can you get the Princeps on there too?"
": Yeah, is that what you all want me to do? I guess I'm saying like, who's the team that's going on? Should I go on, on Aurora?"
: I think you and I should go.
": Yeah you two, the Princeps, anybody else? I can go and give like little help actions and stuff like that, but I'm also good here."
: I think that Lucienne will also be there.
: And I think Riva should go-
": I think should definitely go, I'm not gonna just-"
: I think Riva go in the psychodrone.
": Oh that's great, that's great. You can be in two places at once."
"Siobhan: I can, I only have two spell points left, which means I can cast one first level spell and then cantrips."
"Brennan: So I'm gonna need us to make, because this is in a pitched combat, we might make a sloppy decision, that's okay. We're making a call right now."
": Two of us should stay on the ship, everyone else is going."
"Emily: Okay, so I-"
": Both Barrys on the satellite, or one Barry here?"
Lou: Both Barrys on the satellite.
"Siobhan: Both Barrys on the satellite, I think I should stay here 'cause I actually think that I would be more useful giving help actions."
": Are we worried? Just- I just wanna, just one last thing before I take this little minivan of a dog around and collect everyone, are we worried that, do we feel like, oh, maybe we should have some gunners coming at what's attacking us?"
": No, this is a full decoy that's going as fast forward- We're only doing movement forward."
: This side in.
": If we don't make it through this, that's fine."
: All right-
: Yeah.
": Skipper, I know that you've been gone for a while, but here's 5.000 credits. Don't fuck it up."
: You've cussed at me. (all laughing)
": Yeah, we cuss now."
: We're new.
: I slap and I kiss him.
": Ow, what?"
": Okay, Riva, you've used your actions. Skip has disappeared, Norman is going to, is anyone doing anything to the speed of the ship or no?"
": I guess Norman, can Norman take the same flight?"
"Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, same pilot actions."
": I think that would, he would take the bonus action to move forward."
Lou: Let's fucking-
: I'm gonna move it forward.
": Yeah, I'm gonna use my, I'm gonna boost the engine in the ship. I'm gonna use a hull dice or a power die to boost engines. We're gonna do this, we're gonna engine tune this ship, we're gonna roll that dice is gonna be a six, we're gonna multiply that by 50 that's 300."
": Okay, is that increasing the speed of the ship or is that?"
: By 300.
": Okay, the ship's speed is now 600."
: Wow.
": So that would be it's a, if its full movement, Can we, so drop our line."
"Emily: We have time because I think Aurora can literally take two dash actions so that's like 400 feet. And then if I convince her something is hostile it's like another 80. So I think I have, I think I can collect everyone and be ready to just jump onto this thing."
": Cool, Norman pilots the ship forward, Aurora Nebbins, Zortch jumps onto Aurora Nebbins. Aurora Nebbins grabs Zortch runs past the reactor, you toss Gnosis to Zortch who grabs it?"
: Call me.
: Barrys.
: Barrys are coming along.
"Brennan: Both Barrys are going to the satellite. and Margaret, Sid's staying on the ship or no?"
: No.
"Brennan: Sid's coming also, this whole side of the table plus Barry, Zortch, Aurora Nebbins are all going."
Emily: Yeah.
: Riva.
": Since I'm using Aurora's thing, I'm gonna buffer myself just in case."
"Brennan: Copy and Riva, you're staying cause you wouldn't be able to psychodrone this round anyway."
": I wouldn't be able to psychodrone on this round anyway, 'cause it's a bonus action."
Brennan: Yeah.
: I'm out of spell points.
Brennan: You're more useful on the ship.
: I'm more useful on the ship.
Ally: Great.
"Brennan: Copy that, great, cool. So the pilot, the coordinator and the mechanic stay on the ship, both gunners and operator jump off, you just rush out you see."
: I change my pants really quick and then I do a little spritz.
": Spritz, spritz, spritz, cool."
Brennan: 900 feet.
": Margaret, we gotta go."
: Just it's a bonus action.
"Brennan: Cool, I'm gonna say, cause this is crazy as hell, but basically you guys use your whole turn this turn to get on Aurora Nebbins, rush. You see, as you rush for the back of the ship you see Plug says, remember, you're not gonna die till I die, and you know when I'm dying."
All: Tomorrow.
": He opens the door to his Stuff Hut, you all dive in and he ejects it and the Stuff Hut rockets and slams into a gate on the Fang of Frangus, you have 900 feet of movement left if you wanna keep moving past the Fang."
": I'm gonna go, I guess it's just kind of left of the Fang, kinda getting cover behind all these meteors over here."
: Dope as hell.
"Zac: So like somewhere around here or like, you know."
"Siobhan: I think we were only 1200 feet away, if we have 1800 feet of movement, can we actually use that last bonus action to hide, instead of-"
"Lou: Yeah, can we hide? Yeah, can we throw up camouflage?"
Ally: We want them to see you guys. We want them to chase you much past the Fang.
": Cool, yes, great, got it."
": Incredible, okay."
"Emily: Actually, instead of buffer, can I have drank Roonaloonian Absinthe?"
: What is this posture?
"Brennan: Well, sure you want some absinthe have some absinthe."
Lou: Can I use a bonus action to do a line of Kublacaine?
Brennan: Yes.
: Gunnie's absolutely feeling himself in the reactor room right now.
": Oh my God, I got two fours, I got eight tech points. (Ally clapping)"
"Lou: Okay, we're up right now."
": So, I'm like-"
Zac: So.
": Bonus action, uh, um... critical analysis on Barry."
: Thank you.
": Okay, amazing. All of you guys land, and the gate opens into a dim, dark satellite orbiting over Rubian V, the Fang of Frangus. Your escape pod locks into the dock, you will have your next turn, you- Aurora Nebbins is with you, Zortch is with you, you have Gnosis. You're so close!"
: Fuck!
Brennan: So at the end of- So is there anything else happening from this? Is there anything else happening here?
Siobhan: In this turn?
"Brennan: In this turn, before we move on."
": I used that action, I used my action, I used my bonus action to do drugs, I think we're good."
Brennan: Amazing.
: Can I make a perception check for Loose Duke?
": Oh yeah, I'd love to do a perception check for Loose Duke."
": Oh yeah, you're in the tunnels."
": Yeah, go ahead make a perception for Loose Duke."
"Emily: Can I have an objection interaction, to make a perception check also?"
": Perception, that's a 15."
": 15? You don't see Loose Duke. And the ship is continuing out more, 900 feet past."
Zac: Yes.
"Brennan: So the ship moves past, the Wurst heads- And you have near total cover, you have three quarters cover in this asteroid field right now."
Zac: Great.
"Brennan: As you fly forward, so Gunnie at the mechanics core, both gunners Margaret, Zortch, Aurora Nebbins and Barry Nyne out on the Fang of Frangus. Riva and Norman Takamori are on the bridge. Skip pursuing his father. At the end to your turn, Skip, at the end of your turn you catch, you feel something wet and warm. By whatever sense cerebroslugs are able to sense psychic energy, it is hard for us to imagine how they might sense these spaces. To describe them in our words with our limited human ability will always fall short of this incredibly alien species' perception of the world, but to use metaphor, you leave the cold metal of the air vent, drying out your mucusy corpus and arrive at a place where suddenly your senses come back to you. You are in a place that, for a cerebero slug, we might describe as a hall of power. And you see before you, your father, King Prilbus. You are somewhere in this place where each of you has the ability to fight for power, control, the destiny of yourselves and perhaps of the free galaxy. Your father beholds you, Valdrinor."
: Prilbus.
: You would speak so to your own father.
: And I will not bend my slug body to you.
": No? Then perhaps I should do as such and bend your slug body to mine. Have at thee! And he- Yaah! Leaps at you, you both lunge forward towards each other and feel control over something. You and your father are going to make opposed piloting checks."
: You can brain slug the brain slug?
": Opposed pilot checks, Box of Doom. Your father adds plus 10 to this roll."
Zac: Okay. He just rolled a 14. You're trying to beat a 24 in the Box of Doom. What do you roll?
: I have a plus 10 as well.
: Okay.
Ally: C'mon...
Lou: Just like you father.
"Brennan: That's an 11. Your father leaps at you, and pushes you out of the way."
: Can Handy Annie help me?
Brennan: What's that?
: Can Handy Annie help me?
Emily: That's why I-
": Not in this moment. You see that your father edges you out of the way and whether to you it is a sense we can't understand as human beings, but almost like color and light as just the force of his will manifests and he goes, Ha! You're still nothing but a child, and the child's mine. Riva, on the bridge, you see an air vent grate explode up as Loose Duke jumps out of the air vent- (cast shouting in indignation and validation) You were fighting for Loose Duke's brain stem!"
"Emily: I knew it, I knew it!"
Ally: You were rolling to take over Loose Duke.
Emily: This! Is why! This is why I worried!
"Murph: He's incapacitated, So he was dead in the vents."
Emily: I knew it!
": What's up, baby! It's space. Loose Duke's been on the ship the whole time."
Zac: Nooooo! Noooooo. Loose Duke is loose!
: I will never trust you again.
Siobhan: In real life.
Lou: In real life.
: In real life.
: You've done irreparable damage to our relationship in real life.
: Just imagine if I had crit on one of my perceptions checks to find him.
"Brennan: A miserable, filth-caked cretin. (all laughing)"
Murph: What is his story? How long has he been there?
": A miserable, filth-caked cretin erupts out of the air vent, punches himself in the face hard, slams his face onto the keyboard, does a backflip and runs backwards into the wall and collapses. You see that King Prilbus looks at you and says, Now to cut your ungrateful body out and to force you to serve. And you see rolling around on the ground, Riva, Loose Duke rolls pulls a knife from his belt and goes, (straining, grunting) And one hand is pushing against the other, as Skip fights within Loose Duke's brain."
: Child's mind? What is your plan?
": My plan is to birth the God Slug, and remake the galaxy in the name of Frangus."
": We can be guaranteed, though, that Loose Duke has shit stats though, right? If he's able to take him over?"
": Thank you, I'm so sorry about that."
"Zac: Probably, yes."
: Thank you so much.
: Now I'm contesting with Prilbus.
: Prilbus.
: Prilbus!
": Prilbus, all right. Back to the top of the order. Talespire, we're gonna move Brigade Tigers another 800 UFTP, U4F, Vercadians. (Emily laughing)"
Brennan: Griivarr.
": Do you wanna get a microphone for your seltzer? Ally and Emily, give me another d20 roll for the Vercadians and for U4F."
: C'mon U4F.
: Seven for the Vercadians.
: Seven for U4F.
": All right, as you decoy out of here, you look back and see the Vercadians are- We're gonna go ahead, two of those Vercadians are gonna go down and you guys see those go down and the U4F blue ship off the port bow of Gust Weatherall's Command ship, one of the U4F ships- Up in flame."
Lou: Which one?
: This blue ship off to the side not the Lady Pike.
: That's not who I was worried about.
": Not the Bad Call, not Dan Scrap."
: What's in Skip's left pocket?
Emily: Oh yeah.
: What is in Skip's left pocket?
: 45 cents.
": Wow, oh, I hope he is left with a lot of money."
": I just gave him a 5.000 credits that I gave him, doesn't put it in his left pocket and then think that's what he's got."
": He's like here Gunnie, it's sort of a receipt and a straw wrapper."
": Talespire, we're gonna go ahead and move Weatherall's Command ship another 1200 feet towards the Fang of Frangus."
Lou: Towards the Fang of Frangus.
": Another chance for the UFTP to repair their comms. They are going to repair their comms. Riva, coming in- Oh, sorry, I didn't roll with disadvantage, sorry. They do still repair their comms. Riva, coming in over that you see a badly burned Damien Factor go, hi, hello."
": Hi, Damien Factor, how are you?"
": Good, I'm looking for Zortch."
": Unfortunately, Zortch is unavailable at the moment, can I take a message?"
": Oh, where is Zortch?"
": They're unavailable at the moment, can I take a message?"
": Okay, go ahead, give me either persuasion or deception, whatever you want to try to like, and the number you're trying to beat is a 19."
": Okay, great, I beat that well, I got a 19, I got a 19."
": Yes, 19, does it?"
Siobhan: Okay.
": You see Damien says, all right, no worries. All right, how far away is Gust Weatherall from, let's move the Guernican ship 1200 forward as well. Guernican Tigers are gonna move 800. Okay, Griivarr is also gonna continue, those Griivarr fighters are gonna join with those UFTP fighters, let's move those Griivarr fighters another 800 feet forward and we'll move the Griivarr command ship another 300 feet forward. Okay, so everyone's continuing to close in."
Siobhan: Yes.
"Brennan: And UFTP's comms are up, okay. The Wurst, its your turn again."
"Ally: Oh, my gosh, yeah, babies."
Murph: What's going on on this Fang?
"Brennan: All you, you're all on Aurora Nebius, you surge forward."
"Emily: Yeah, I mean, I look to Ms. Margaret, Ms Margaret is my boss so what should we do?"
Ally: Let's go.
Emily: All right.
"Zac: Are you on, you're on the Fang?"
Lou: The Frangus.
"Emily: Yeah, we're on like this like sort of like dock on it so I think we're just, we're gonna run on and use, let's just use a dash action cause and see what that reveals to us, she's hasted right now."
: Can we stealth in?
: Can you stealth in?
": I could if I drop Haste, she'll lose a term, but then I could cast smuggle."
: Okay.
: And if you wanna do that instead.
: I think we can just go in kind of blazing.
: Okay.
Zac: Probably are expecting a lot of things to happen.
": Yeah, so let's use, let's have Aurora take her first hundred feet of movement in."
"Brennan: Dope as hell, you rush in so Aurora is gonna take a movement in, Aurora rockets along the satellite and immediately gets to the central room on the satellite. You guys rush in, you look around and see sort of within this chamber here that you guys have beat your way past a lot of your enemies. You've like outstripped them by so far that they're still well behind you. You see that there is a waiting transportation pod ready to shoot down to the moon's surface. Looking at that you immediately, I think Margaret, you would immediately clock that as a King Prilbus in Zortch's body was gonna toss Valdrinor, in Skip, into this transportation pod to just rocket him down to the planet down straight down. But you walk in Zortch has Gnosis and goes 'Now?'"
: Yeah.
: Yeah.
: As soon as possible.
: Can we all go down?
": Is anyone in this room, any humans?"
": You don't see any human beings in this room, it looks totally unpopulated here."
: Can we do some sort of perception sense of smell?
: What kind of perfume does Lucienne wear?
": Just really like, it's almost like Cedar, so it's kind of like masc, but then it's really beautiful. It's really beautiful, but like earthy."
": Barry, noses up."
: Give me a perception check with advantage.
: That's gonna be two sixes for my Barry.
": Barry Nyne goes, cloaking devi- (mimicking gun shots) Gunfire opens up as emerging from cloaking devices are tons of UFTP shock troops."
": Okay, can we attack them?"
Brennan: Absolutely.
: Okay.
": Okay, so they have readied actions so they're gonna get some shots off on you guys. There are about 10 of these shock troops in the central chamber with you that were awaiting Zortch's arrival, cloaked, they're all gonna take some shots."
Ally: And it just troop people those are the only.
"Brennan: These are the armored ones, these are not like the sly agents that you fought on the rec station these are the."
"Emily: Can we say that we at least rode strategically on Aurora so that like Margaret's in the very back, I'm behind, like the Barrys are in the front."
"Brennan: Hell, yeah."
": Okay, yeah."
": So I'm gonna do, you guys are like leading the Vanguard, you walk into the room first, they're gonna take all shots on you some will take shots on the others, but they'll have cover behind you guys."
Murph: Cool.
: Okay.
": But not me, I'm also taking cover because."
": We could, I mean, yeah, this would technically it's a bonus action so we couldn't say we were guarding them as we went in, could we?"
: I'll allow it.
": Okay, I think then that Barrys little guard hit Barry Nyne is cool with that."
"Brennan: Cool, all right, Barry Syx, these guys, what do they need to hit."
Murph: They need to hit a 17.
"Brennan: Jesus, okay, so they need twelves. Miss. You take 18 energy damage halved to nine as does Barry Nyne."
"Murph: Sweet, I'm going to a bonus or I'm going to reaction do my heal up."
"Brennan: Cool, hell yeah and then there's gonna be some attacks on, so someone's gonna take an attack on Margaret."
"Murph: Okay, so I'll say I'm guarding Margaret."
": Did you use your reaction to get your, are you using your bonus action to guard?"
: Right.
": Yeah, that's his bonus action."
": Gotcha, okay, cool, cool, cool. So does that mean that has disadvantage, correct?"
: So that has disadvantage and if it would hit I can choose to have it hit me.
": Cool, that's a natural 20."
"Ally: I'm gonna, I can call to the guards."
"Brennan: I think Barry's already, yeah."
Murph: It's just that doesn't help I don't think.
": It's just you would get to attack them if they missed, but it sounds like it's a hit."
": Okay, I'll just take the crit."
: Take the crit seven halves to three points of damage to you.
: That's a crit.
Brennan: Not very good.
: Not a good roll.
"Brennan: Okay, that's and then another one's gonna fire on Zortch who's already looking pretty injured."
Siobhan: Crap.
Brennan: You see Barry Nyne is gonna take a guard action for Zortch.
"Emily: Yeah, yeah."
"Lou: What a king, just like any good Barry would."
": That is a hit, Barry's gonna take that hit."
"Siobhan: Big, Barry behavior right there."
"Emily: Oh, Wow."
Brennan: And that's
: Barry on my wayward sons.
": So you see just these two beefy, identical men, one with like the crazy pink Mohawk and the gold armor, one in the black armor with the hair shaggy. Oh, the ponytail, sorry."
"Zac: Oh, did you give him a ponytail?"
Murph: Yeah.
"Brennan: You see, he was over. (mimicking gun shots)"
": Pony it up, pony it up."
": Pony it up, incredible, that's gonna be your guys' turns. So Aurora Nebbins has used all of her movement to get you all into the area here."
"Emily: Well, she used a dash action, but she is hasted so she would still have an action to attack."
"Brennan: Gotcha, okay, cool, coo, cool."
: So how many.
": Yeah, can we attack and stuff now?"
": Yes, you can absolutely attack that now, there's 10 of them spread out in an arc around the room. So all of them are about from you and Barry Nyne right now that are, and each about five feet away from each other."
": Okay, so I can only hit two at a time with a burst, but I could start rapid shot-ing if you have any way to make them fail dex saves, but I can also just take my chances."
": I do have my, I mean, I can."
: If I threw a grenade could I try to stun them?
": Yeah, do you have stun grenades."
: Yeah.
": Yeah, why not?"
": Yeah, I have a ton of grenades from our big fight that I didn't really use a lot of grenades."
: Throw stun grenade.
"Brennan: Hell, yeah."
: I throw a stun grenade.
": Okay, you throw a stun grenade, you're gonna be able to hit two of them with a stun grenade."
": Okay, great."
": We'll roll those right here, hold on, coming in front of the board, one saves one is stunned."
Murph: So I think we'll even just leave that one alone.
Ally: Great.
"Murph: Cause, so that one's just out of commission so nine left."
: I'm almost thinking should we just take our gun shots?
: So start fighting them?
": Yeah, I think I'm not gonna use my action to grenade, I think I'm gonna use my action just to use my two attacks."
"Brennan: Hell yeah, go for it."
: Does that sound okay?
": Yeah, get it up definitely."
": Yeah, I think we're just taking shots."
": Yeah, I'm like, cause it seems like a grenade will only hit two."
"Brennan: Yeah, they're like perfect ambush, they're ambush squad so they're like spread out diffused, ready to fire on whoever enters the room or to provide security if Zortch comes in."
: You guys start cause you guys.
": Okay, I will do, oh boy. Okay, I'm gonna guess these guys aren't dextrous cause they got all this arm runs, but maybe they are, but I will take my chances."
Brennan: Cool.
": Rotary cannon, ooh, what should I do there? Okay, I'll do rotary cannon, I'm gonna do rapid."
"Brennan: Hell, yeah."
: So they do dex saves.
: Amazing.
Murph: So it would be just.
Brennan: Two of them making dex saves or?
": Is rapid, you just shoot one of them but twice?"
"Brennan: Rapid is, yes, yes, yes, exactly."
": Okay, so I'll just try on one of them, is that smart?"
": Fails, fails the save."
: Apparently.
Brennan: So you're gonna roll double damage on this.
": Sweets, come on, okay, not bad, now we roll that too. Sweet six, 14 in the zone, 16, 26 damage."
Brennan: Dead.
"Ally: Yes, okay, okay."
Brennan: That's one attack.
: So that's one.
": Then I will do a second attack, I will do duh, duh duh, same thing."
Brennan: Cool.
: And one next to him has to do a dex save.
"Brennan: Cool, cool."
": One stand, one dead."
: He succeeds on the dex save.
": Succeeds, okay and I just missed."
"Brennan: Cool, I'm gonna make say Barry, Barry Nyne's doing the exact same thing, you see you. (gun shot sounds) And for the first time in a long time feel a dude go back to back with you. (mimicking gun shots) and another guy behind him drops."
Murph: Hell yes.
Emily: Okay.
: Six is the same as nine dude.
: Six is the same as nine.
"Emily: So then I guess we've got, so we've got two down."
Murph: Ship's upside down.
Brennan: It's upside down dude.
": Two down, one stunned so I'm gonna have, I'm gonna send Aurora Nebbins after another one."
Brennan: Cool.
": What does she add to attack, it's not on her thing."
": Oh, sorry, it should be, she adds a plus six."
": Okay, does a 14 hit?"
: 14 does not hit.
": Okay, so she just misses."
": Ooh, targeted strike."
": Okay, go for it."
: It's a three.
": Sixteen, three hits."
: So she has a d12 so that's nine plus whatever she adds.
Brennan: Four so that's 13.
: From the targeted strike.
": 16, okay. badly injured, one of them is ah, a dog starts attacking."
": Okay, I will try to attack that one."
Brennan: Incredible.
: 21 to hit.
": 21 to hit, yeah, that hits."
": Okay, so that is nine more damage."
: To which one?
: The one that was injured.
: Dead.
"Emily: Great, I will also spend a tech point to give myself extra AC."
Brennan: Whoa.
": Extra six to my AC and then I will take my second attack on another one, this one's not gonna miss, it's definitely gonna hit that's a 26 to hit."
Brennan: 26 hits.
: And then it will be 10 plus four and I will spend another tech point to add to the damage so that is 17 damage.
: 17 damage to another one of them.
Emily: Yeah.
Brennan: Amazing.
: And then since I got six I'm gonna use my reaction to throw a grenade at the one that's hurt.
": Okay, copy that, go for it."
": And it's gonna be just a fragmentation grenade, so I have my explosives so it's a DC 16 dexterity save."
: Makes the save.
": Okay, still takes half damage though, come on baby, let's roll good."
Murph: Bonus action to keep the guards up.
": Cool, yes, you and Barry are guarding Margaret and Zortch yes."
": So they still take half, so they still take six."
": Take six damage, take half."
Emily: Yeah.
: Dead.
Ally: Nice.
Emily: Whoa.
"Brennan: The Barry's and Sid is perfect triad of you guys, you see actually Barry Nyne looks at you and sort of angles out to get Sid in there back to back to back as well."
: Like a little triangle.
Brennan: Little triangle. (mimics machine gun shots)
: Nuts and bolts and nuts.
: Nuts and bolts and nuts.
": Nuts and bolts, heavy on the nuts. (Barry, Emily and Brennan laughing)"
": Not to get too greedy, but can I use my movement to walk up to someone and be like you suck and then walk away? (all laughing)"
": Sure, he goes, I don't suck and take."
: And talk about opportunity.
": Yeah, take attack opportunity."
": Okay, cool, do they attack me?"
": Yeah, for sure."
": Okay, I call to the guards, so if they miss then Barry gets to attack them."
: Okay.
: Unbelievable it rolled natural three misses.
: Yes. (Emily and Margaret laughing)
: Kill them as I'm running in my heels back to the dog.
Zac: Till you roll your ankle again. [Ally] Ow.
: I'm gonna.
": Once you roll it, is just keeps rolling a little bit easier every time."
": All I'll just do a regular attack, I was gonna reckless attack, but that's stupid. I should have maybe done that, that's a two, I missed."
Ally: Dang.
": Okay, but correct I'm wrong, so he still misses, but he misses the attack on you so misses the attack of opportunity. Margaret, any other actions from you?"
": No, no, that's it."
: That's it okay. (Emily and Murph laughing)
: It's just the use.
": Oh, wait, it was a two?"
: I rolled the two.
": Oh, okay, wait, but you have critical analysis if you want, which would be a plus five and I can."
": So, I would've had, okay so that would be seven"
: And then call to the guard.
: Eight would've been 15.
": And I get, because call to the guards is I roll, if the attack misses an ally immediately makes a weapon attack as part of the same reaction, roll the superiority die add the results to the allies attack."
: So you would add to a 15.
Emily: Yes.
Brennan: Hits automatically.
: Yes and whatever this is it adds damage.
"Brennan: Okay, roll your extra damage."
: Okay.
: Five.
": Okay, five."
: Let me roll that too.
": 18 plus 5, 23."
": 23, so you walk up tell this guy, you suck he goes, I don't suck."
"Ally: Ah, ah."
"Brennan: Barry, you see this guy and you just unload. Yes, you do. (mimicking gun shots)"
": Five down one stunned, we got this."
Emily: Yes.
: Incredible.
": Zortch looks out at the stars, looks at the room, sees the ships coming, can feel the like hum of the satellite as ships come in, Zortch phase walks forward through center of the room, no longer able to be guarded and puts Gnosis the center of the room. There's one's stunned, but there's four troops left and Zortch puts Gnosis into the center (Gnosis booting into the system) and that's gonna be Zortch's turn."
Siobhan: Breathe.
: I only threw one grenade.
Brennan: You threw one grenade.
: Can I ask a bonus action cause I didn't cast any spells Med-pack Zortch cause you said they were in a bad way.
"Brennan: Yes, go for it."
"Ally: Amazing, I rolled two ones, but then it'll add a"
": It's their hit die, right? I thought."
": No, oh no, no, this is a spell."
"Brennan: Yeah, got it."
: So it's one d4 plus my tech casting which is. (slow tempo music)
: So many pictures.
": Is it just intelligence plus proficiency, right?"
: For tech casting.
": Yeah, so eight, so two plus so 10."
Brennan: 10.
: 10 hit points.
": Zortch's breaths in they put their hands out and you can see the shape of Gnosis' electric Android body begin to fade into existence above the Holofract and a beam of light coming from the satellite going straight down to the surface of the planet begins to connect. within Loose Duke's skull. You feel your father go, huh, the Emhatchening it cannot happen without me. As the psychic wave begins to come off of the Fang of Frangus."
Zac: Sorry.
: Can I direct Skip?
Brennan: Yes.
: With whatever it is that he's doing.
Brennan: Amazing.
: I'll use my psychic abilities.
"Brennan: So we've done everything aboard the Fang, right? So you guys are in pitched combat, Margaret's aboard. The beam begins to coalesce into existence we're gonna go back to the ship. So Riva you connect psychically here."
": You're right, Skip, you can do this. Are you're all right? You can do this."
"Zac: Skip is going to pilot, try to pilot."
Brennan: Absolutely.
Siobhan: Roll that over.
": Here's how this is gonna work. It's, I'm gonna first roll your father's piloting check in the Box of Doom."
": My father's piloting check, how novel."
"Brennan: Plus 10, 12, 22."
: Okay.
": I'm gonna make an offer to you, you tell me if you want to accept it."
": I accept, okay."
": You're making contested piloting checks, your father just got a 22. If the rolls are within five of each other, within five points of each other, it's a stale mate. The fight continues. If one of you beats the other by five points, you can end this right now. What that would mean is you would roll a d20. You have the direct action from Riva. On a 17 or higher. You would gain control of the body over your father. On a seven or lower you would lose to your father."
": I mean, Skip is the best pilot in this galaxy."
: Here we go. You're gonna roll two d20. If one of them is above is a 17 or higher the battle for the fate of the house of Frangus ends right now.
: All rise.
"All: All rise, all rise, rise."
Zac: All rolling.
Lou: What the other one?
Brennan: 18 (cast cheers)
: The house of Frangus is mine!
": Oh, can I have my dice?"
"Brennan: Hhold on, yeah. I'll get you the die back, hold on a second."
: What was the other number?
Lou: 11.
"Siobhan: 10, 11."
"Brennan: Unbelievable, Riva."
: That 18 looked bad.
": Riva, you psychically send waves, you focus the disturbance from the Fang of Frangus satellite. Skip, you see your father directly in front of you. Ah don't you understand, centuries of planning for the Great Emhatchening, Valdrinor, this is your destiny."
": You're right. And I have, at this point, taken over Loose Duke's body?"
": You shove your father out of the way, connect your mandibles to the bottom of the brainstem, and you are in control of Loose Duke's body."
: I sneeze my father out onto the ground.
"Brennan: Yeah, so you see, rolling- So Riva, rolling the ground, Loose Duke rolling, rolling, rolling leaps up grabs the back of his head, slams it into the thing and jacks a finger way up his nose, all the way past the knuckle."
"Lou: Jesus, Brennan."
": I think the request was ""Can I simply sneeze him out?"""
": And to that I said, I'll see you and do you one better. And he goes, (mimics sneezing out and grabbing a brain slug) Skip, you're holding your father in your hand."
"Zac: I drop him to the floor, I take off one of Skipper's boots, put it on my dirty ass foot and I step on him, firing into him."
: And shooting straight down.
": I say, the king is dead. Long live the king. (all laughing)"
": Incredible, well, I know your majesty, the king of the cerebro slugs, Lord of the house of Frangus, incredible. You are in one of the worst bodies you've ever been in."
": Yes, horrible, I'm about to eject it. (all laughing)"
": Okay, so that's your turn. Riva, you're taking the action, any actions, any other, that's your action and bonus. I'm gonna say firing and winning that is action, bonus action, Riva."
: I don't think that there's anything else I can do.
: Is there anything to a way to project the Skipper's mind to the world? I don't know if that's-
": What if I do, if I can do a shot of that vodka that gives me some tech, some force, some psychic powers back I can."
: Absinthe.
": I can if I have a shot of the old green fairy, I can potentially, I think I can probe mind."
: The old green fairy
Brennan: Yeah.
": Or something, hang on."
": You take a second to do that, Gunnie."
": No, oh, 6.000, okay so yeah, so I can, um, then, grab onto somebody in the Amercadian ship and have them hallucinate the exact sort of scene."
": I'm gonna say this, give me like a psychic power attack role."
: Okay.
: So it's just proficiency plus your spell casting.
: Okay. Thats's a 27.
": Oh my, God, you reach out now without Skip inside of Norman Takamori's skull, you reach in the cranial bolt removed and grab that perfect memory. You reach out, Riva, from your comm station and use the nearby satellite to beam straight to Madrugada Station to hit every Amercadian comms channel in the galaxy. As you upload this hologram hallucination, you also see embedded in it the video. Hi, I'm Sister Sadie Zeb of the Cosmic Veil alive and well in Mas Vegas, Lavada and that video starts to play as you broadcast that memory of Skip the cadets, Gusty Vines, as that happens."
: Go on Twitter and get the hashtag #gustyvines.
Ally: Yeah.
": As that happens, you get a comms on your screen from the Amercadian space brigade. ♪ Amercadia ♪ This is Admiral Analinda Weatherall, whom I speaking to?"
": Hello, Admiral, this is comms officer Riva, from the Wurst."
": Over here, Analinda, I can explain. You see that Gust Weatherall appears saying, Analinda listen, there's a bit of mis-big, big, big!"
": I don't know if you've ever met any Aquatunsians, but actually we're really very bad at lying, we just sort of don't do it."
": Analinda looks at you and goes, yeah, you are bad at lying. Gust, you dumb piece of shit. We're drumming you out of the brigade. Analinda, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! And you like detect a powerful comm signal going up and you see that these sort of like virtual shimmering like sign or like flag on the side of Gust's ship goes dark, the ship is still moving, but his ship is kicked out of the brigade. That is Riva's turn. Gunnie, what are we doing?"
": All right, we're patching the ship, we're just gonna make it better, fix some of the stuff."
": As you start to patch, as you're about to patch the ship, you see a little beacon come on, asking for you to allow an opening in your ship's defenses. The call sign is from a ship you don't recognize that the sort of like call signature on it as you like decode it is ""The Random Factor."""
: It's asking for an opening?
: It's asking to be allowed through your ship's shield to board your ship and the ship's name is the Random Factor.
: What is that?
: It's Natalia.
": No, no, there was a good Random Factor."
: The Junkmother talked about the Random Factor.
": Open, yes."
": Right next to where Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut docks into your ship, you get your second escape pod back, which has been traveling this entire combat from the Griivarr Command ship, coming from the Griivarr worlds, it opens up and as it docks, a little comm screens open, and you see a little android centaur with a trashcan lower half going, Hey there, boss! Pleasure to be aboard, here, courtesy of the Junkmother, looks like you guys are takin' some damage. You must be really juicing this thing."
": Yeah, we're really giving it to it. Can I put you to work immediately?"
": That's why I'm here, boss."
": Great, well, if you could do us a favor, you regenerate the shields, I'm gonna work on just the structural stuff."
": All right, you got it! Let's bring the shield back up."
: All right!
": Servo Sam comes aboard with a ship created by the Junkmother, and sent to you guys at the last second. Go ahead and take both those actions. Servo Sam's gonna take one, he's gonna use your stats, and you can take the other."
": I'm gonna, so my patch- Oh, okay. That patch is for sure gonna do it, so we'll fix that and then, for the regenerating shields, we're- We'll take the, let's see. Do I nat 20? I do."
Ally: Really?
Emily: Ooh!
": Yeah, it just means that we don't have to take the two, the lesser of two shield die, it's the least exciting net 20 of the day. That's a full eight shields back."
Brennan: Eight shield points back!
Emily: Woo!
: Servo Sam's killing it.
": You see Servo Sam, again, like gray coveralls, little hat, kinda like square jawed with permanent five o'clock shadow, legs could not be got, but he's got a little, you know, tank tread trash can for the lower half of his body, you see takes a little thing out, hits. Acme Ashmuns? Lah-dee-dah!"
": Yeah, something special, ain't it, Sam?"
": And we would've regenerated shields at the beginning of this turn, also-"
"Brennan: You would have, so we'll throw another five on there. Incredible."
"Lou: But then Gunnie, high on Kublacaine, is not doing as great a job, and is only gonna repair the hull for three."
"Brennan: Okay, copy that."
"Emily: Wait, you repair the hull?"
"Lou: Yes, the hull."
"Emily: Awesome. Oh, wait, was Servo Sam's to the shields or the hull?"
: Servo Sam's is to the shield-
Emily: Okay.
": The more important task, and Gunnie's on the hull."
": Awesome, okay, we are up to 12 hull points,"
: Okay.
: I think- Does Skipper still move?
"Brennan: Yes, Skipper still moves."
": Okay, so Skipper is gonna-"
": I feel like also, if he needs the help action from Handy Annie, she's probably popped out of the vents."
": Oh, yeah. I think Skipper at this point is just gonna move into the asteroids to the left. I'm not sure if there's any- I'm not a hundred percent who would still try to shoot at us at this point, but like, move, I guess it's like, 900 feet this way."
: Is there a thing? Is there an action-
": Let me, I'll bring up a point here."
Zac: Oh yeah.
": How far away from these guys isolated on the satellite, do you feel like getting?"
": Maybe, could he like ready an action?"
: Is there a thing that pilots do that's like essentially like a dodge action? Is there something we have?
": There's evade, right?"
": Yeah, there's evade, but I do have Slippery Pilot which lets me take a- Oh, I don't have a die. Yeah, I can take the evade action."
": I'm gonna actually, if you want to ready an action to do something, like, to basically get another turn on your next turn, that's totally fine with me."
": Okay, cool."
"Brennan: Cool? Okay, back to the top of the order. It's all been leading up to this."
Emily: Oh my goodness.
": Talespire, I know everything's so- It's all so-"
: I have been high for the last four hours.
: I need the Vercadians to crit.
: Yeah.
": Tigers continue, Tigers are gonna take another 800. UFTP... I'm gonna have the UFTP command ship... No, you- Wait, yeah, UFTP already repaired their comms, shock troops say, We got a problem. Communicate back to the ship, UFTP goes, All forces to the Fang, the Fang! And UFTP is gonna try to fix their piloting systems. They still have disadvantage on this, they just need the lower die to be a 12 or higher."
Siobhan: Nope.
": 18, 17. Yeah, they do it. Okay, so UFTP command ship is going to orient towards the Fang, they have their weapons system back on, the command ship is going to... Is going to move forward its movement, which I believe is..."
: Hate this.
"Brennan: Main ship's gonna move forward 300. It's going to reactivate its point defense, and then it's gonna take two attacks- That's gonna take two attacks on the Wurst."
: Ooh.
: Does the Wurst have cover?
"Brennan: Yes, it does, your AC right now is effectively 21, it's rolling with disadvantage."
Zac: Okay.
: Miss.
: Yeah?
": And miss, two misses. (cheering) But you see asteroids on either side of you, Skip. (mimics explosions) Whole asteroids, just splitting in half. All of the UFTP fighters are going to take a double move, they're gonna go 800, trying fall in after their command ship, racing to the Fang as they know something bad has happened. Give me attacks for U4F here and for Vercadians here."
": Seven, oh my gosh."
": U4F, come on, baby! Okay, 11?"
": 11? Okay, yeah, U4F- You see, Jan comes over the comms, you see there's like sparks coming out on her bridge, her ship's taken a lot of damage. Hey there, Encino, what's the plan? And she sees that you are no longer on the ship, and are on some weird satellite with hyon beams blasting around on either side of you. Holy hell, what the hell happened?"
": We're getting in there. Keep going U4F strong, baby."
": She's gonna continue, Tigers move. UFTP fighters are moving. U4F is gonna keep hammering that Amercadian ship, Vercadians are gonna start to take double moves after the UFTP faction. It's gonna be another from the Amercadian flagship."
"Emily: So like Gust Weatherall is like disconnected, but still on a war path."
": Just, like, going rogue."
"Brennan: Yeah, fully going rogue."
Lou: He's lost his mind.
": But he's like, there's no like morale check for like the people on board that think they're Amercadian soldiers?"
": There's probably a potential, if- But it's possible that Gust, on the bridge, didn't allow the comms to go through like everybody on his ship. But if you could communicate that to his ship, that could be a way to like-"
"Ally: Totally, cool."
": Yeah. Guernica is gonna take another 1200 feet of movement, their tigers are coming in as well. That's gonna go back, that's gonna be the turn of the- One of them is stunned. Four of them are gonna take shots."
Ally: What about Griivarr? Are they still attacking-
"Brennan: Oh, yes, thank you. Yes, Griivarr is gonna take another couple shots long range at the UFTP command... Rolled two 18s with disadvantage. (cheering) That's gonna be another 24 damage to the UFTP command ship. And that is another hit and- So, 48 damage from the Griivarr command ship to the UFTP ship. Incredible, look at- As all, this swarm of ships coming straight towards the asteroid cluster here. Aboard the Fang of Frangus, shock troops remaining, there's four left. They're gonna take shots at Zortch."
Lou: Zortch!
": Zortch, okay."
": And we can't guard them, right?"
: You cannot guard them. They're gonna use psychic power to throw a psychic shield up. And I believe you got them up to like 11 HP.
: I added 10 HP to them.
"Brennan: Yeah, they were at one hit point so that's- They're at 11."
: My gosh.
: Okay.
"Siobhan: Oh, Lord."
: But right now...
Emily: Let's hope their psychic shield is strong.
": It's an 18, they have an AC of 18 right now."
: That's pretty good.
: It's pretty good.
: So one of them is stunned?
: One of them is stunned. (dice clattering)
": Okay. That is unbelievable... We're gonna roll only two hits. I'm gonna roll in front of the board, each of these is 1d6 plus three."
Siobhan: Oh no.
"All: Snake eyes, snake eyes, snake eyes..."
"Brennan: Six. Nine, uh-"
Murph: So-?
": Zortch drops. Zortch is at zero. However, they have all used their turns."
": How far away is Zortch from us, too far to guard, I guess?"
: Zortch is like 30 feet into the room.
: So now...
: Is it our turn?
: Is it our-
"Brennan: Yes, correct."
": Okay, I mean, I'll immediately bring Zortch back up with a med pack, bonus action, for... This time, I rolled two fours."
: Nice.
: Plus eight is...
: 16.
: 16.
": Incredible, Zortch is back- So, Zortch is up for 16 after getting hit with those blaster rifles, hold on one second. I actually just realized, okay. There are other guys in this room still, Margaret, you ran back behind these guys, right?"
": Yeah, we were, I think I was guarding Margaret, and-"
": My AC is 22, right now."
: Barry Nyne was guarding Zortch.
": They miss you, these guys have multiple attacks, but some of them are still firing on you guys. Barry, you are gonna take... Seven, halved to three-"
: Okay.
: And seven halved to three.
": Okay so six, another reaction to get back some health. I gained back more than I lost, which is great."
Ally: Incredible.
: You're getting stronger the more they hit you. They hate to see this.
: I'm so mad.
"Brennan: I'm so mad right now, okay."
Zac: Six is the same as nine.
Brennan: Incredible.
": Okay, so I- I brought Zortch back up, what's happening with Gnosis? Are they like traveling down?"
": It looks like the holofract- So there's like an ethereal, ghostly, electric android form of Gnosis hovering over the holofract. A beam is coming from the holofract reconnecting them to the planet which is their actual supercomputer."
": Okay, so it seems like what we wanna do right now is clear out this room."
": Is this- What you wanna do is clear out this room. Zortch looks at you and goes, (gasps) Holofract... needs... and psychically communicates to you a need. All that Zortch needs to do is hit a certain DC on a technology check, that's what they need to do."
": I mean, I-"
: Critical analysis.
: On Zortch?
: On Zortch.
": Can you help, and I'll guard them?"
": You get the feeling from- You also have the feeling from Zortch that multiple people can attempt this, this round."
": Okay, so I'm gonna do that- I will with my, yeah, I'm gonna save my, mm, no. I'm feeling good. I think I will still- So there's four of them standing?"
": Four left standing, yes."
: Have they been hurt at all?
": Four are uninjured, one is stunned."
: Four uninjured.
: I mean-
": Five are dead, five are up, but one of the five is stunned."
: So if one Aurora Nebbins can't even help with this so she's gonna take two attacks.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
: Because she's hasted.
Brennan: Amazing.
": Seven, plus- What was it, six? That 13 doesn't hit, try again. Five, she misses both times. It's okay, girl. And then, I guess I will save my action, I already used my bonus action. I'll throw a one grenade as a reaction, why not?"
"Murph: Yeah, why not do some damage."
": Try and soften them up. I'm gonna just throw- Fuck it, I'll throw another stun grenade, try and target two that-"
: Nice.
Brennan: Hell yeah.
Emily: And it's 16 right now-
": Seven and 11, both fail. Two of them are stunned, boom."
"Murph: Two stunned ones, then I'm going- Oh, do you want to do the technology check first?"
": So yeah, my bonus action was the med pack, my reaction was the grenade, and then my action's gonna be helping."
": Incredible, so you gave critical analysis to, I think Zortch looks at you with a better technology check than them- Within them. They also are like bleeding, so as you move-"
: I technically have proficiency with Gnosis as well.
": Exactly. So you see Zortch comes up, links with you, covers the blood, because you just med packed them, they stand up, hold onto your hand, link minds with you."
: Wow.
": Riva, back on the ship, you feel Zortch reach out to you. You guys see that weird like eclipsing trail of Rivas kind of like ethereally go towards the Fang of Frangus. Margaret, you had your critical analysis"
: On Sid.
: On Sid.
: Yeah.
": What are you doing in this moment, as you give this analysis to Sid over here?"
": I'm saying, I'm so fucking proud of our crew. I love all of us so much. We're doing it. This is it, you got it."
": Sid, I need you to go in the zone for me. Take my shades."
": Okay, I was already wearing some, but I- I'll put 'em, again."
": Sid, take my tiny, little oval sunglasses, kind of like Matrix-"
: Little Morpheus ones?
": Yeah, my Morpheus ones."
": Barry Nyne, can we see your sunglasses?"
": Hey, catch."
: I catch it like a tiara.
": Incredible, okay, it's a DC 25 technology check."
": Technology check, and then- So I'm already proficient in technology, do I get to add my proficiency, or add an extra proficiency? Do I have expertise, since I have proficiency with Gnosis?"
": In a way you do, cause you're adding Margaret's plus five. So that's what it is, you're rolling your normal technology-"
Emily: So I have plus 13.
": You have plus 13 do the roll, DC 25. Zortch is giving you the help action, we're gonna roll box of doom."
"Ally: 12 or higher, here we go, here we go."
"Siobhan: Come on, big money."
: 12 or higher.
Siobhan: Big money.
: 14!
: 14! (all laughing)
: Are you gonna make me-
: Just roll that other one in the box. Five. A 14!
": Oh, can I have my-?"
": Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Ally: Oh my God.
": Sid, as you reach out, Gnosis looks down at you. Keeper... The lasers, the hyon beams traveling through space are moving about this... fast... time slows."
: Is this the absinthe?
": In a sense... To disperse one's self, to walk soft the all, to be everywhere for everyone... As you touch the Holofract, it connects to the satellite. The Fang of Frangus illuminates, from space, this beam shoots down to the planet. You feel, in your body, a enormous psychic wave come up as all of the cerebero slugs on the planet begin- Just sort of melt themselves, to begin the Great Emhatchening, and then the holofract reverses direction. The House of Frangus is no more. There is only one member left."
Emily: Keeper of souls.
Brennan: Keeper of souls.
: Long live the House of Frangus.
": As the holofract reverses direction, Gnosis goes, To disperse, to make safe... To make whole... Rubian V is not whole. What was that substance you found in the crates at the beginning of this great adventure?"
": Eggs. Well, powdered egg substance."
": Worm holes all over the galaxy- (zooming, blipping) You see Rubian V... You just feel, as a mass of powdered imitation egg substitute-"
Siobhan: Disgusting.
"Brennan: Manifests in the center of the planet, absolutely filling it. Compacting, becoming molten hot, forming a core and, once again, refilling the hollowed-out moon of Rubian V, destroying countless credits worth of mining equipment, UFTP property, destroying their mining operations on the planet. (zooming sound) A great cry goes out from the planet, as..."
: Is this what we killed all these people for?
: No!
: Just to fill a planet with egg substitute? (all laughing)
": Well, the plan- It was very dangerous for the planet to be this hollow, and they were still mining out all that lithium, and that was very bad, and now-"
": All right, we'll see where Gnosis is going with this."
"Ally: If we filled it with something nice they would just start mining again, okay? This is how these people think."
: That's true.
": Gnosis, the holofract (hissing, whirring) begins to separate from itself. Gnosis says, I'll see you everywhere. The holofract disintegrates, and- (rumbling) the satellite stops spinning, as throughout the servers of every computer on the galaxy, Gnosis simultaneously nests itself, and also escapes from ever being keepable again. You see a comms come over. We got some bad news, UFTP, it looks like all our mining apparatus on the moon has been destroyed and, uh- I don't know how put this, but we're not getting a reading on the holofract anymore. Coming up on the comms channel in front of you, Riva, Damien Factor sort of appears, and looks at you and goes, hi, we're getting reading on a holofract that doesn't, that we're not getting anymore."
": Hi Damien, how are you? How's your day?"
": Ha, it's been... I've had better."
": Well, that's sad to hear, unfortunately it both does and doesn't exist."
": Gotcha, okay. You see, again, the Fang of Frangus is spinning in space, this connection down to the planet again, the planet has been filled with all this worm hole of stuff that is no longer a hollow world. And you see UFTP sends out a comms to all the other people here, to all the other factions, and says, Hello, this is the flagship of United Free Trade Planets with unconditional surrender. Thank you so much. We are unconditionally surrendering, and you see as Gnosis has disassembled itself, and the Fang- The House of Frangus is destroyed, there's no contract for them to collect, and there's no holofract to steal."
: Do all the people on Rubian V just like wake up into their actual bodies?
": Yeah, what about all the slugged people?"
": All the rich, slugged people."
Brennan: You guys see-
: All the rich slugged people.
": Yes, so, this is weird 'cause you guys can't quite see this, but what's happening on the surface of the planet right now... So, again-"
: I just turn on the news.
"Brennan: Yeah, you just turn on the news. Jimmy the Snout, Rootersnoos ferret. You guys look down and see the beam of light connecting to the planet that, again, worm holes everywhere fills everything up, for all of you that are left there Gnosis actually looks at you and says, is there anything else I should try to do before I'm everywhere?"
": Yes, and I- Can I take out my phone and pull up... Sorry,"
: Oh my God.
: And hit play.
: Oh my God.
: You want me to play this everywhere?
": Yeah, and I want you to watch it with us."
: And if you could maybe have a scrawl of our Smash 'n Grab account-
": Like, when it's pirated and it says like, ""Putlocker"" but it's, like, our-"
: Putlocker?
": Also, if you could squash all the medical debt of all the people that were in Gunnie's position."
: Yes.
"Brennan: Oh, I can do that."
": Oh, cool, that's a better idea."
: Zeroes out all-
Ally: La famiglia. (all laughing) Zeroes out all of that debt.
": I guess I assumed once everyone saw 200 Fast, 200 Furious, they would just-"
: They'd be forgiven.
"Brennan: So the 20 billion pilgrims all over the surface of Rubian V all go- (retches) Urgh. Oh, oh, gross, gross, as these partially dissolved slugs just start to drip out of their noses. So there's 20 billion people all going, ""WHERE AM I?!"" after, you know, nargons, or entire cycles of being brain slugged, However, they do not die and so UFTP does not collect five Quintillion credits."
": And actually I believe, by maritime law, if you surrender to somebody in space, you get to take that spaceship."
: So thankfully...
: Miraculous.
": Miraculous, how about it. Just started The Great Emhatchening just enough to dissolve before they melted and incinerated the brains of all those host bodies."
: Do they all come to burrowing? Weren't they actively burrowing?
": Yeah, it's a bunch of upper middle class people burrowing into the soil."
: You have your arm fully in the earth.
"Brennan: In the earth, and you're like, I think, my brain feels hot like a dissolving slug was gonna DNA meld with my brain stem and melt my body as I burrowed into the earth to make a God slug, but instead that didn't happen. Instead it didn't happen."
Zac: Congrats.
: That feeling when...
Brennan: That feeling when.
: Relatable!
"Brennan: That is your technology check, the UFTP troopers are still- Have guns, opening fire on you guys here in the space."
": Two of them are stunned though, remember?"
": Actually yes, two of them are stunned-"
: There's only two awake?
: And I still have a turn. I-
Brennan: Yeah.
Ally: Incredible.
": Read the room, dude. Uh, I'm gonna shoot the dude."
"Brennan: Yeah, absolutely."
": If you hit, you auto-crit."
"Brennan: On the stunned guys, yeah, absolutely."
": Oh, let's go for the two awake, that are shooting at us-"
": Reckless, cool, that's a 23 to hit."
: Hits.
": Oh my God, I rolled two sixes so that's 12, 17 plus my rage, 19 damage on the first one."
"Brennan: Dead, amazing."
: I'll shoot the other one with the second attack
": Incredible, 15 on that, that's going to-"
Murph: Bonus action jump and punch him into the earth.
"Brennan: Dead, boom That's two hits from Barry Nyne."
: I think they're all-
: That's all of them.
: Everyone's stunned or dead.
"Brennan: Yeah, Barry Nyne comes in and grabs the two stunned guys and just hurls them down the shaft of the satellite. Tosses them, Incredible."
"Ally: Can I use my action to call Lucienne, and just see if I hear like a phone ring?"
: Where is she?
: You call- You call Lucienne?
Ally: Yeah.
: Like I'm just kind of quietly like dial.
: Barry's murdering people.
": You call Lucienne, her phone picks up, (pings) and connects. You see Lucienne looks at you goes, hello? And you see that she says, where am I? A door opens up, you see her in the closet of your room on the ship. Hey, I got hit over the back of the head with some kind of pipe, and put in this room. Where am I?"
"Emily: Oh, she boarded with Barry Nyne."
: Or... How long is...?
": I was talking to Barry Nyne, to the king and I was talking about how, hey, after the, I was like, hey, once the Fangus... Fangus... happen... we could use this holofract and he was like, oh, you wanna use the holofract for something? And I was like, yeah, it's a very powerful supercomputer. And then I turned, cause there's a little cappuccino station downstairs on your ship."
: It's really nice.
: And then I woke up in the closet of this room.
": That's... crazy, that's really crazy."
": Ooop, I'm fired."
": Yeah, definitely."
: I just saw my email.
: Yeah.
: I'm gonna cry.
": Okay, yeah, go ahead and cry."
: Can I be in this room and cry?
: You can be in there and you can cry.
: The yogurt stash.
: And there is a yogurt stash.
: That's exactly what I need.
Ally: Yeah.
: Exactly what I need?
: Yeah.
: Is yogurt.
": Definitely, I would also- There's a bunch of like paper and pens and stuff like that and I want you to just sit down and just start writing your feelings out, just write them all out."
": Is it weird that I, but I feel like I should get a haircut today."
": Yeah, you should shave your head."
: I'm gonna shave my head.
": Big changes are coming, girl. (all laughing)"
": I'm gonna shave my head. Margaret, I don't know what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life."
": Yeah, definitely, maybe you won't be like so obsessed with like power and control and greed, you know?"
": It's like you try to control stuff, but you can't."
": Just, you can't. No, you can't... You almost can. This was close. Honestly, hats off to you."
": Okay, thanks for saying it was close."
": Eat some yogurt... (smooch) Ah, cute! I felt it, I felt it."
": Do we have any cameras in the ship to see what happened, who bashed Lucienne over the head?"
": Oh, Lucienne mentioned to King Prilbus when he was in Barry Nyne, she was like, you know, ""after you do your thing, if we use the holofract..."" and Barry Nyne just didn't like that and King Prilbus did not like that. Incredible."
: How did they get on our- Nevermind.
"Brennan: In the prison break, when your ship was in the hangar surrounded by UFTP people."
: They've been there the whole time?
: They've been there the since the prison break.
": God damn it, we need to do a full sweep."
": We need to do a sweep, we just need to do one sweep every now and then."
": Yeah, 'cause you can't just crit on a perception check to find Loose Duke, you just can't!"
": Can I do a perception check to see if there's anybody in there? I mean that's pretty high, but it's not a crit."
": If I crit, will you tell me if there's anyone else loose on our ship?"
: If you crit right now?
: I didn't.
": All right, so."
Zac: Can I hide in a vent? (laughing)
": So are there any other actions on this- As you guys see, here's what's unfolding in front of you. As you have finally released Gnosis, that is now in existence all throughout countless servers throughout the galaxy, impossible to be hoarded, kept, selected, grabbed, bent to the will of the powers that be, but instead ambiently throughout, walking softly as a cybernetic intelligence throughout the galaxy, you see a couple things happen. Number one, the Griivarr command ship begins to move in to, uh, take over that UFTP vessel. Uncle Bob comes up on your comm screen and says, I wanna thank you again, Miss Encino, for being a real pal."
: You're creepy and you're already dead.
": Hey, you know when I'm gonna die. NEVER. (cast laughing)"
Murph: That was scary.
: That was scary.
: Scary in real life.
": You need to like, do-"
: We need to do acid on the Griivarr Worlds
": Scary in real life. Me, right now. Ally."
": You see Arcadia Prime comes up on the ship, comms and goes, what happened to the holofract just now?"
": Hi, how are you?"
: Is it gone?
: No.
: It's not?
": Sell it to her, sell her like a box or something."
": Here's the thing, the holofract is gone, it disassembled."
": No, we can say anything is the holofract."
: Like when you sell a bridge to someone-
Murph: She's gonna kill us-
: That you don't own.
: If she thinks that.
": Oh yeah, you're right, okay."
": Oh, then- Yes it's, I mean, yes, it's gone, but it's also... In you."
: It's in me? Give me a deception.
Ally: Can I give the help action?
"Brennan: Yeah, you can get the help action here."
": My first ever lie is- Oh, with a help action. Nope, that first one was better."
: It's nice if Riva can't lie.
: I got a 21.
": She goes, you're right. I'm more powerful. What's more powerful than a supercomputer? A super being. Being, and I am being, and that's what art is. Art is the art of being. We are going to use my living body to power the Anti- Causality Engine."
": Yeah, that sounds great."
"Siobhan: Bless you, you gotta do that. (chatter) Do that."
": We're going back to Guernica, into the ship jumps in faster than light, all of your factions have been defeated save this Commander Weatherall, Gust Weatherall bearing down on you."
": Oh, bloody Gust."
: So.
Ally: You should go take over.
"Brennan: Boom, boom, boom, you see Jan comes in we got his one last ship left, what do you want us to do? Give you another roll for the Vercadians and the U4F with just this one last command ship."
: Come on.
: 10.
: 14.
: 14.
Emily: For the Vercadians.
": [All] Vercadians fall out, U4F falls back, Talespire, let's go ahead and move Gust's ship forward another 1200."
": My God, this guy won't quit."
": I mean, he's got nothing to lose now."
": Coming up on the comms, you see Gust again, looking at you, Norman, you drummed me out of the brigade, I'm gonna drum you right out of this galaxy."
": Oh, you drummed me out of the brigade? Ironic, right? (laughing) That's what irony means."
": Gonna take some shots with disadvantage Five, miss eight, miss, two, miss Turbo lasers, boom boom boom! Asteroids all throughout, it comes back to your turn again. All the shock troops are dead, Aurora Nebbins is there"
: Yeah.
Brennan: Can get you guys-
": Let's just get to Plug, let's get to the ship."
: Yeah.
": I'm gonna say just with Aurora Nebbins' action, she grabs all of you on her back, gets to Plug, boom, gets you all back aboard the ship."
": Yeah, I've flipped around with my, you know, prepared action."
": Aurora's gonna have a tough time coming down from this so I let it, if it seems safe, I'm gonna let, I'm gonna give her- cause it's tactical advantage she has like loses a turn."
"Brennan: Cool, copy that. Aurora gets you guys, Aurora, so I'm gonna say the escape pod, now you have two escape pods on the back of your ship, the Random Factor and Plug's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut, you arrive back on the ship, all of you are aboard. Gust Weatherall's command ship is bearing down on you with all of your U4F allies struggling to keep up with the Vercadians flying, trying to catch up with the command ship."
"Emily: Oh, we regain a shield."
: You regain a shield die at the beginning of that round.
"Ally: Let's go, Skip."
: Go where?
"Ally: No, I mean, let's."
Brennan: Eight shield points.
Zac: Can I still contact Gnosis in some way?
": Gnosis is everywhere, if you want to contact Gnosis. First of all on that other turn are you staying in Loose Duke's body? Like, what are you doing?"
"Zac: I'm gonna hover over, Skip is gonna hover over Skipper's body, hanging outÔÇª Just there to help with whatever and say to Skipper like to myself, like this is, This is your moment."
"Brennan: You see a just again, filth-caked Loose Duke look right into Norman Takamori's eyes and say, ""This is your moment."""
: Look at me.
"Brennan: You run the scene, you're doing it."
"Skip: Look at me, okay. This is your moment."
"Norman: Who are you? (laughing) And Skipper is going to flip. Well, I think Skip is going to ask Gnosis, if there's any way to harden our prow more than it has ever been hardened before."
": As a parting favor for the crew of the Wurst, ironically named, as your first review would suggest, I would be more than happy. You will do double damage on this ram action."
": And Skipper is gonna turn the ship around, aim it at the admiral's vessel and shoot straight at him."
Brennan: This is gonna be our last gamble of the season. As you're leaving the asteroid belt to charge this command ship.
: Double damage that we also take?
": You'll take, you know, you'll take the half, but it can go through your shields, your shields will be able to do what your shields need to do."
: We have 39 shields and 12 hull points.
": 39 Shields, 12 hull points your shields, I can halve that."
: Can I ask an action do something to boost the hull points?
": Yeah, we can patch, yeah."
: Don't we have--?
Brennan: Servo Sam's here as well.
": Yeah, well I think the damage is to shields, right? On our ram action?"
": First, would be to shields."
": Yeah, I think we- Servo Sam can regenerate shields. I can patch the ship and you can boost shields if that works."
: Yeah.
: We can also shoot.
: That's true.
": Tear it up, we can soften them up first."
: That's true.
Lou: Here it is.
: That's true.
": Great, then I will patch shields or whatever the other thing was."
: Boost shields.
"Brennan: All right, if you cannot take this ship out, you're gonna be in short range, so you've got one turn to try to take this ship down."
: Got it.
": Oh shit, we don't have,"
: I made the strength check for boosting the shields.
": Okay, how many temp HP does that give the shields?"
: I don't know.
": You roll, if you make it then you roll just a flat d8"
": Okay, great."
: If this is all.
"Siobhan: I got an eight, yes."
Brennan: Another eight shield points.
: Woo!
": Great, if this is, are you guys hitting the gunners?"
": Yeah, we're hitting--"
": We're doing it, this is..."
: I'm gonna instead of.
: And those are temp or how many shields?
: Temp.
": I'm gonna go, I'm gonna use one of our, I'm gonna weapons overload as a bonus action."
: Okay.
: And roll a d8.
Brennan: Okay.
": Murph, your gun is gonna do an extra five damage. ...this turn."
: And mine still does that d4.
"Lou: And your still does an extra d4 and has plus one to attack, that's my, so that'll be my bonus action and then it's my action. I'll just do the- I'll patch the ship and Servo Sam is gonna do the shields."
: Do we have any points to use?
": Yeah, we have four."
: Amazing.
Lou: Now we have three.
": Gunnie, you're running through the reactor core slamming buttons, Just again, Servo's whirring all over the ship, patching the hull. Servo Sam, I got yer back here, boss let's get these shields up as far as we can."
": Two nines for Servo Sam so that's, well, two and take the lower, that's a seven still. So seven more from Servo Sam."
"Brennan: On the shields, shields up another seven?"
: I'm gonna fail a patch check which means what exactly...?
: While you're doing that.
": I have a question, when we ram does it do any kind of save?"
: Yes.
Emily: Awesome.
: It will have to do a...
: Then I'm gonna try and get off a discombobulating shot. So they'll have disadvantage on its next ability check or attack roll.
Lou: Only one more hull point.
"Ally: Okay, I'm gonna boost weapons... ...and I do. You get advantage on the damage roll of the next ship attack."
Brennan: Incredible.
": Sweet, do we get any, are there any other guns on the ship for Barry Nyne to shoot?"
": Barry Nyne says, I could take a little cold... and just pops his head out the moon roof of your gunner station to fire his regular gun. Oh, like face freezing, ah, in the cold of space."
: I'm gonna wait to boost weapons cause do you roll for the ram?
": So this is how the ram works, you take the ram action you make a strength check opposed by the target's dex-"
"Emily: So it is a check. Okay, so it is, so discombobulating shot will give them disadvantage and I have two chances to do it."
: And then.
": On a failed check the Ram action. Oh, wait on a success both you and the target ship take kinetic damage equal to two of your ship's hull die plus your ship's strength modifier."
: Okay so.
: What do we have power dice-wise?
: Three.
": Three, so I'm definitely gonna- let me go."
": And if this is an attack run, we will add...target ship takes additional damage equal to the distance of your attack run divided by 50."
": Oh, yeah."
": I can also give you, I can give you advantage if you want."
": I have advantage on my first one, but I could use it for my second one. Cause I spend a tech point to get a second shot."
": Actually, don't know if we can get there in this turn."
": I'm gonna allow, I'm gonna say you guys can wait hiding behind asteroids until it's close enough for you to surge out."
: Okay.
: Great.
": Okay, sweet, can we say- since Barry's just firing with his regular thing, can you just be giving me the help action essentially?"
": Yes, he can give you the help action."
: Great.
: Okay.
": If I would do a distracting shot, that would be one attack for me and then as long as I hit, that gives you advantage."
": Okay, I already, yeah, so I already have advantage once per turn from weapon- Okay, but yeah, then I'll do it, okay, great, yeah, let's do it."
": Okay, here we go, let's start to roll these attacks, gang."
Murph: Okay and how many power dice are we using?
: You have three to use.
": You have one, save at least one for me for discombobulating."
: Do you need any?
": Zac, do you need power die or no?"
: I don't think I do.
: Cool
": Okay, then I will start with a precision shot just to make sure I hit."
: So one and then I'm doing it...
: Cool.
Zac: And I'm gonna add a d6 to one of the attacks that have advantage just whoever can roll with it.
Murph: To the attack roll or the damage?
: Just the extra damage.
"Murph: Cool, so precision shot."
": Yeah, an attack that has an advantage so."
: Cool.
: You just did it.
: Nat 20.
": Oh, my God, okay."
Emily: Whoa.
": So and then I'm also going to use, so when you hit a ship with a ship attack, so I'm also going to use distracting shot."
: Okay.
: So I've got...Jesus So it's going to be... Then it's going to be another
: Oh my God.
: So 8d6.
: But then add because we're brutal critical you add an extra damage.
": And then I added extra damage die, so 9d6"
: And then I added a d6 to...
"Murph: My one ship, so 10d6."
": 11d6, that's probably doubled too, right?"
: Yeah.
": 11d6 plus plus five, so 11d6 plus- it's gonna be my...11d6, (Brennan laughing)"
": And because of boost weapons, the wording is on a success you have advantage on the damage roll the next time your your ship deals damage."
"Brennan: 11d6 plus 10, let's roll it."
: So you have 11d6 with advantage on all 11.
: And I can re-roll one's and two's.
: And you can also reroll one's and two's.
"Brennan: You start doing, is there more stuff you do after this for...?"
: So she now gets advantage on her attack.
Brennan: While you're rolling.
: Mine might be quicker to resolve than yours.
: Yeah.
"Brennan: While you're rolling damage, Murph, cause you're gonna roll it twice and take the better damage roll."
: Yeah.
": Emily, you go ahead and roll your attack."
": Okay, first attack is a... I think it's gonna hit it's a..."
: 19 hits.
": Okay, so 19 damage on the first one, I'll spend a tech point to do a second attack."
Brennan: Okay.
: Does a... Does a 17 hit?
: 17 hits.
: Ooh.
: Rerolling those ones and twos and that d4?
": Oh, no, I wasn't."
"Lou: All right, this is why we check."
: This is why we check.
Lou: We paid good money.
": Just double checking, is there any other actions coming from Margaret, Riva or Gunnie? We have everything done?"
: I should probably go to my room and just like check on some stuff.
": Yeah, for sure."
: Gunnie is gonna use his bonus actions to start giving himself a tattoo.
: I love it.
": ""Gunner Channel."""
: Just like a soldering iron write into the metal?
": Yeah, right, it's mine now."
: 21 damage from the second one.
": Okay, so it's 19 and 21, incredible."
: 60 damage. (Brennan laughing)
": Oh wait, sorry, I'm raging"
: 62 damage.
: Unbelievable.
": Unreal, okay."
": Oh, wait, I have that thing that will let me me know what are their shields at? What are their hull points at? We get to know exact numbers."
": Incredible, okay, you wanna know how many hit points this thing has?"
: Yeah.
": You are operating it, the U4F ships chewed through all of its shields. Normally it has 170 hull points, right now it has 124 hull points until it takes 62 damage, It takes a hundred... And- it takes literally 102 damage, has 22 hull points left."
": Oh, shit, I also spend, wait, I do more than that because I also hit, I also do spend a...what do we call?"
: Power dice?
": Power die to do discombobulating shot. So it's next, it has disadvantage on its next ability check."
: Okay.
: And then it also does another three damage.
: So it's at 19.
: It is at 19.
: 19 and it has disadvantage on this.
": So it's at 19 hit points, we're gonna resolve the ram right now."
: Resolve the ram!
": It's my strength, our ship's strength versus their ship's maneuverability or dexterity, okay, I have advantage because it's a attack run."
": You have advantage, it has disadvantage on what it does, We're gonna roll right here, disadvantage. Lower of the two is a minus one is a 12. You are gonna roll with advantage now, you need to beat a 12 on- is this a strength? No, it's a ram. Ram is its own..."
": Ram is it says yeah, strength, ram check."
": Yeah, so the ship has its own ram score."
": Yeah, so ram for us is plus six."
"Brennan: Okay, go ahead you need to beat-"
": Sorry, I just realized it actually I do two extra damage. cause I forgot that I've done this time."
": It's at 17, all right, you gotta beat at 12."
": No, no, no, I do four extra cause I hit it twice."
"Brennan: It's at 15, you gotta beat at 12 here."
": You can do it, you got this."
: Two and 15.
": 15! Baby, roll damage! So with that extra, you're gonna do 300 feet of movement so that's gonna be divided by 50 is six. You're doing another six points of damage as part of the charge, go ahead..."
": Our shield, our hull dice are d8s, right?"
"Brennan: Yes, d8s."
"Zac: And so this is an attack plus, sorry, Rams are plus..."
"Brennan: So you succeed on the Ram, it's 2d8 plus the ship's strength, which is three, plus another six so it's 2d8 plus nine, we're gonna roll this box of doom as well."
"Ally: Come on, come on."
": Reroll, roll that in the box of doom, seven plus nine is 16, it has 15. You do 16 points of damage! Oh, you-"
: This is such a bad idea! BOOM! Through the heart of the Amercadian vessel.
: Skipper looks at it and it say no more running.
"Brennan: A hot dog explodes through the very core of the starship! BOOM! Gust Weatherall's ship is destroyed. The Wurst is victorious. Metal scattering through space, no enemies left, The Vercadians salute Jan de la Vega, that's a hell of a charge, cap, my hats off to ya. And a new comm comes onboard from Acme Ashmun, better deal than anticipated, has just cleared to your account. Your money from the fight comes through, your ship is flying, your crew is safe and you are richer than you have ever been in a galaxy full of adventure. The next, I think the only thing left is later that evening, at Barry's Big Win Casino..."
: A wedding?
": You're the... Hey, cap,"
": Skipper looks for Loose Duke, Finds him and says, Thank you... Let me talk to everybody else for... Crew? Gathers everyone around, says, looks like you hit those shots."
": Yeah, thank you."
: You're not being sarcastic.
": No, we barely heard it at all with the...honestly, horrible idea. I could, that was a bad call, but because of you guys it wasn't! Because this is a great crew."
": Appreciate you saying that, Skipper."
": Yeah, really is."
: Margaret.
: Yeah?
: I still really don't know you very well.
": That's okay, we actually all own the ship and you signed your part over to us."
: No kidding? So in a way you're the stranger to me on my ship.
": We're both strangers, yeah."
": What does it feel like when you have, is it kind of like a spa day, like you get to check out when the slug is in there?"
: You know what?
": A little R 'n R? I think in a lot of ways, it is. And there were times when it was a spa I didn't necessarily want to be at, but now I've grown to like, it's a little more comfortable."
": You had a brain slug, but you also had a metal plate erasing memory, so it's kind of cool that that's out."
: I think that was aggravating.
": Yeah, definitely."
Zac: In hindsight that made me feel bad.
: Yeah.
": Yeah, you know, Skipper, I don't wanna speak for the whole crew, but we could use a... ...co-pilot."
: Yeah.
: Like really low level co-pilot.
: Yeah.
: We could.
": Yeah, like one without a vote."
"Brennan: As you're saying this Skip, who's still in Loose Duke, looks"
": you feel psychic energy radiating out as the last member of the house of Frangus computer screens nearby scintillate, and Gnosis begins to send data to these screens of a vast number of other houses of cerebro slugs, Not even just houses, just other cultures, communities of this species of being that, you see for the first time, has the capability of living symbiotically. That many Cerebero slugs are happy to simply augment and enhance and live side by side with the bodies that carry them, they just need a brain stem somewhere to be safe and they are happy to coexist and live with these beings. It was simply Prilbus and this House of Frangus that saw this relationship as being fundamentally exploitive and predatory."
: Right on. (all laughing)
": I think Skipper looks at Loose Duke, signals for him to come over and then."
": You guys see Loose Duke just spits this slug straight into the back of this Skipper's throat, Loose Duke goes, AHHHHH!! and just sprints off into the ship."
: I grapple him!
": Yeah, I shoot a tranquilizer at him."
": Yeah, Loose Duke is out."
": This is the best crew. It's funny that it's called the Wurst, it's a better name."
": We came up with it, it was a pun, we thought it was funny."
: The Red Hot felt unnecessarily sexual.
": Yeah, oh, interesting, I see that now. Skipper reaches into his pocket and he pulls out his little, his wings and he hands it to Gunnie, he says, you're right, we do need a co-pilot."
": Gunnie folds his wings in the hand looks down at the tattoo he tried to give himself at which point, a ship rammed into another ship. So it says Gunner Chanelllll."
: Gunner Chanel.
": Gunner Chanel. (laughing) Thanks... ...dad? I guess, it's not... we got a real father thing going while you were gone."
": Oh, that's interesting. But, hey, come here And Gunnie walks in and hugs Skip, you know, head of course, just like underneath his pecs, just like as a short king, You made me the man I am, by being mean to me and then really, really, really nice."
: You're not a coward.
": Yeah, I know."
": We cut to the Wurst in space. We are at Barry's Big Win Casino Over in one corner, are a huge number of Vercadian Protector Droids with a whole bunch of Warfare Whitneys packaged up to go back to actually the Handy Andi corporation that is going to take them and sort of this, sort of slap dash Warfare Whitney program, he's gonna be able to reuse them and do their original programming."
": Can I look at Servo Sam and just say, I kind of wanna save one and send her to the Junkmother."
": Oh, I, that would be..."
: I just feel like the Junkmother has such creativity she might see something in them that we didn't even see.
": If you wanna send them all there, we can send them all to the Junkmother."
: Maybe they stop with the Junkmother first and then they go to...
": All right, that sounds good to me. Hey, tough guy, this tall drink of water. Let's send all he's back over to the Junkmother and Servo Sam comes over explain to."
"Sid:  Margaret, is this a bad idea?"
"Margaret: No, we have a lot of money for shipping."
"Brennan: You see the Vercadians are over there as Servo Sam goes and starts to get ready for the Warfare Whitneys to get sent out to the Junkmother. You see, one of them momentarily kind of snaps on and looks over and says, Hey there, sugar, That was some good shooting out there."
: Are you playing nice?
"Warfare Whitney: We got beat, I'm a little sad."
"Sid: Yeah, but you did wonderfully. You were all flying in space like a great swarm and I was so scared and all I wanted to do was just fight on the same side as you."
"Brennan: Servo Sam turns on the rest of them and they all sort of look over and they say, well, we only can do one thing and that's fight and we couldn't even do that as well as you and your friends."
": But you know what? You know what happens at the end of this? You might have lost, but you're gonna go meet mommy."
": We're gonna go, oh, in unison, We are gonna go meet mommy? All the Vercadians Protector Droids say, to meet the mother and Servo Sam says, Yeah, ma is great. And every other like organic organism here looks over like Androids are weird. (all laughing) You see in Barry's Big Win Casino, Cap, you are standing in between Plug and Bambi LeRoux."
Emily: Oh.
": I would ask, we're all gathered here to honor the union of Plug and Bambi, such a beautiful union between two people should only, I think we would be honored if someone who could speak on this topic definitely knows about a relationship with between two people Riva, if you wouldn't mind giving us a few words about..."
": When five people love each other very, very much, they come together and form an incredible immortal bond. And for these two people to have found each other means that there are only three loving bonds away from the ultimate, ultimate love, which will create 10.000 children and I think that that's really beautiful."
": Raymond Zam goes, ""Hear, hear! Hear, hear!"" Here in the wedding, in the sort of like casino stools that have been assembled like pews are all of your Jib Jobbers, Raymond Zam is there. You see the girl guides in the back whispering to each other, pointing at the sort of unattended casino as the wedding takes place. You see, sitting next to you, Margaret with a shaved head is Lucienne, going, I've been crying for days."
": Ah, that sounds really hard. I think I'm like, I'm definitely less into her, but I am just concerned this is becoming like true friendship. I'm just kinda like, yeah, eat the yogurt"
": You don't think less of me, do you?"
": No, I mean, what you're doing is very cool and important and you're going through a lot of changes it's just kind of like...I did that years ago, you know? So like if you need any help on the way"
": here, you should sign up for a one on one and I have her sign up for a meeting."
": Incredible, you see off of the corner, Lamelia Lafarve is here with a couple of the Chesters that all start throwing some confetti in unison all together For anyone else here, what can I ask- what are you doing here at the wedding? As we have the glorious conclusion to this wonderful odyssey?"
"Siobhan: I think for Riva it is a beautiful moment, but I think also makes them realize that maybe it's time to go home."
": I think a Galavant can only go so far and some of the things I've learned, I wish I hadn't to be honest, I think it might be time to rejoin"
": Riva, after the wedding, you see, you know, Plug and Bambi are dancing on the dance floor and you have an opportunity to bid a goodbye to all of your friends."
": I do what is called an Aguatunisian exit, which is I message everybody psychically my deep love and then I hitch a ride on the next starship that's popping over, I just jump over."
": Oh my God, my pockets are filled with Pleasure Putty. (Brennan laughing)"
: All my grenades are coated in Pleasure Putty.
Zac: My captain's hat...
": You look over, Zortch - who, by the way, is just now in a full chef's whites, like they fully, you see they're like well, my home world got saved and Gnosis is safe, I think I'm just a chef now."
: Is that cool?
: Would you like to be a communications officer?
": They psychically connect with you, Riva, Riva, would you put in a reference for me for your old job?"
": I don't think I need to give you one, but I absolutely will and let me just say, I think you will do a fantastic job."
": I'll have to learn to breathe water, but."
": No, actually, I think you can just do it from outside the, I don't think the water, I think that's just."
: Incredible.
: You can just do that wherever.
": I psychically like connect back to Riva and say like, you're welcome back any time. And honestly, even if you just wanted to have a one-on-one that wasn't about like performance, just a catch up."
": Honestly, I might check in with you on that and if ever seen an Aguatunisian hitching a ride, just let 'em in."
: I mean.
: We got all the equipment for it.
: We installed this huge ass tank.
": Honestly, right now Aurora is in there."
: Oh yeah.
": Aurora Nebbins, chasing some tortoises through the water system."
: It did find actually a really good use.
": Okay, that's great."
"Lou: I think Gunnie steps in, but walks over the Plug and is like,"
Gunnie: Can I cut in?
"Plug: Well, I you'd be a dandy if you didn't, so have a have at 'er."
: Hello.
: Hey Bambi.
Bambi: You gonna give me a little smile?
(audible smile)
"That's what I like to see, Gunnie!"
": Well, I learned from my dad, well, hey, Bambi, this marriage isn't gonna...you'll still be..."
"(baffled, excited chatter)"
"""Where are you going?"""
: Where could you possibly...
: This marriage isn't : what? Isn't gonna what?
": Gunnie, did you just cut in to make sure that our casino was still gonna have its biggest gambler?"
"Brennan: She looks at you and says,"
"Don't worry, I'll be here gambling every single day."
Gunnie: That's so good to hear.
Lou: And I spin her away.
: She spins away.
: Spin her in the direction of the casino.
"Lou: Yeah, back toward the tables. I go back to going shot for shot with Barry Nyne."
"Brennan: Yeah, Barry Nyne comes down with Servo Sam being like,"
": I just got that third gunner pod, ready to go."
": Yes, dude."
: Barrys back in action.
: Barrys back.
"Barry Nyne: Nuts and bolts, heavy on the nuts."
Sid: Barry!

"Sid: Barry, you fucking idiot."
": Yeah, what's up assholes?"
Murph: I think Barry Syx spends the next like bunch of days like going around and like introducing Barry Nyne to like the whole crew and like essentially just like filling him in on all of the memories and since they have the exact same feelings just like getting them on the level.
": Incredible, its like, oh this is incredible, dude. I'm getting right up in there with you!"

: What? Barry Nyne is so delighted to discover that.
"Ally: I would love to like have everyone around introduce Lucienne also like, we've picked up a lot of new people… Or maybe I didn't bring Lucienne also, but I'm like,"
"Margaret: Lucienne is kind going through a lot and I understand if you don't trust her, but maybe she could hang out on the ship like a little."
Lucienne: I'd like to apply to be chef.

"Brennan: Margaret, you open up Smash 'n Grab... on the comms channel overhead, This is Rootersnoos ferret, Jimmy the Snout,"
"Coming to you live from Rec Station 97, the incredible action on Rubian V, outside of the Fang of Frangus near Madrugada Station,"
"and you see a clip of your hot dog smashing through a ""decommissioned"" Amercadian destroyer..."
"Folks, you gotta see it to believe it The Wurst, perhaps misaptly named."
"Brennan: As that goes live, your Smash 'n Grab... (ping noises) hundreds of requests come in, your U4F membership contract request one after the other, after the other. Your successful missions saving a galaxy that perhaps didn't even know they were getting saved and perhaps they still don't or perhaps each and every malton unit, they are getting saved in impossible countless, myriad ways that we will never know or see. But the point is this, adventure awaits out amongst the stars. That's all for Dimension 20. Thank you so much for being with us. See you in the stars."
