Our cast of players will assume\\nthe role of heroic adventurers embarking on a dangerous quest. Our story takes\\nplace in the world of Spyre. Spyre mostly conforms to your expectations for a\\nworld of swords and sorcery with one notable exception, and that\\'s Elmville.\\nElmville is a little town in a nation called Solace. Solace may be home to\\nelves, orcs, dwarfs, and gnomes, but it resembles more of a 1950s through\\n1980s America. There are several schools in Elmville, but our story begins at\\nthe Aguefort Adventuring Academy, the world\\'s premiere training ground for\\nwould-be heroes. Our story begins with six freshmen on their first day of\\nschool, and the first bell\\'s just about to ring. Without any further ado,\\nDimension 20 proudly presents... Fantasy High!\\n\\n[eagle shrieks, lion roars]\\n\\nMy name is Brennan Lee Mulligan. I\\'m the dungeon master for you guys this\\nevening. We\\'re gonna be playing a little bit of a tabletop RPG here with the\\nCollegeHumor cast. Say hi, guys.\\n\\nPlayers all say hi, first to the camera, then turning to each other and\\ntalking over one another, pretending to greet each other.\\n\\n≥\\n\\nBrennan: We’ll all go ahead. Let’s just all say--This is Miss Emily\\nAxford.lop-\\n\\nEmily: Not today, but yeah.\\n\\nBrennan: Zac Oyama.\\n\\nZac: Also not today.\\n\\nBrennan: Siobhan Thompson.\\n\\nSiobhan: I will refuse it, take it back.\\n\\nBrennan: Lou Wilson?\\n\\nLou: I\\'ll take it.\\n\\nBrennan: Ally Beardsley.\\n\\nAlly: Sure.\\n\\nBrennan: And Brian Murphy.\\n\\nMurph: As Riz Gukgak.\\n\\nLou: There it is.\\n\\nBrennan: We\\'re gonna be playing a little role playing game for you guys,\\nthanks for coming and playing with us. This season marks the beginning of our\\nadventure into the world of Fantasy High, where we ask the question that has\\nlong gone unasked: What would happen if John Hughes ran a game of a tabletop\\nRPG? And we\\'re gonna find out today. Swords, high school, puberty, magic, it\\'s\\nall coming together. We\\'re going to descend to somebody\\'s home, why don\\'t we\\nhave this decided by a roll of the dice? That feels fine to me.\\n\\nLou: Oho, yes.\\n\\nMurph: Sweaty palms.\\n\\nBrennan: Hell yeah, we\\'re gonna go downtown.\\n\\n[pirate music plays]\\n\\nAlly: Yep.\\n\\nZac pretends to play a fiddle.\\n\\nBrennan: [grandiose] As the clouds part, a flock of gulls flies over the\\nMarigold River heading down to an area of wealth and expansive taste. It\\'s\\ndowntown Elmville, and we see that amongst the manors there is a colossal,\\ngilded man o\\' war, [like a pirate accent] a pirate ship, great and mighty,\\nthat has been dry docked and dragged out of the river, all the way up onto\\nland and turned into a mansion. We see vast hedgerows and various bankers and\\nalso pirates dragging chests of gold up through hedge mazes and topiary and\\nfountains, and we see, out on a little sort of clay patio: Lou, would you\\ndescribe yourself for the other players?\\n\\nLou: [pretentious voice] Oh, of course, hello, I\\'m Fabian Aramais Seacaster,\\nI\\'m a half-elf. I\\'m, of course, the son of the famous William Seacaster, the\\ngreat adventurer who sailed the Celestine Sea, freeing slaves and raising up\\nnations. I\\'m a fencer by trade, I also know how to glass blow and I\\'m quite\\ngood at calligraphy. And I am absolutely thrilled to be here at the Aguefort\\nAdventuring Academy, very excited to kind of start on my adventure of becoming\\nan adventurer much like my father, that I may too, one day, take up the mantle\\nof the Seacaster name and sow my heroism across Spyre.\\n\\nBrennan: You\\'re out on a lovely day. You wake up early in the morning, you had\\na great green protein shake made by your halfling maid Cathilda, and you\\'re\\nout on the patio with your fencing instructor, Herzon, practicing.\\n\\nLou: Fantastic.\\n\\nBrennan: There\\'s the sound of swords and sabers ringing off of each other,\\nFabian, what does your character look like so that we know?\\n\\nLou: I\\'m 6’1”, white hair, a relative--like a thinner, like a very, how would\\nyou say...\\n\\nBrennan: Lean, athletic?\\n\\nLou: There you go. Lean muscle, that\\'s what I was looking for.\\n\\nEmily: [appreciatively] Ooh, hello.\\n\\nLou: Very lean muscle, very dextrous, but also incredibly strong.\\n\\nEmily: Ooh, you thinking soccer player or swimmer?\\n\\nMurph: So like a swimmer\\'s body?\\n\\nLou: Yeah. A real Michael Phelps type.\\n\\nEmily: Oh okay, shoulders, hello.\\n\\nLou: For those of you at home.\\n\\nZac: Picture Michael Phelps with a sword.\\n\\nAlly: And white hair.\\n\\nSiobhan: Such a tiny sword in comparison to the size of his body.\\n\\nBrennan: As Herzon and you fence, your mother, Hallariel Seacaster, a high elf\\nwith beautiful long flowing hair and sort of, kind of like a fusion kimono,\\nsome kind of silk garment-\\n\\nEmily: Oh my god. I love her.\\n\\nBrennan: -hanging off one shoulder. As an elf, she\\'s immortal, so she looks\\nabout as you just like early 20’s, even though she\\'s about 200 years old. She\\nhas just a huge goblet of wine, it\\'s about 9:30 a.m. in the morning.\\n\\nLou: Oh, mama.\\n\\nBrennan: She goes,\\n\\nHallariel: [feminine high-elf voice, clearly drunk] Darling, you look\\nwonderful, are you winning the fight, [laughs] \\'cause I don\\'t-\\n\\nFabian: Oh mama, Herzon is really giving it to me today, but don\\'t worry, I\\'ll\\nbest him yet.\\n\\nHallariel: Herzon, you let my boy win. Let him win, my sweet boy, sweet boy.\\n\\nFabian: Herzon, don\\'t you dare take it easy on me, all right, I need to be\\nstrong.\\n\\nHerzon: [Spanish accent] Of course, I would never take it easy on you. You are\\na champion, you have the gift of your father.\\n\\nFabian: Yes.\\n\\nBrennan: You hear a voice say,\\n\\nBill Seacaster: [deeper, dramatic pirate voice] Did someone mention the man of\\nthe house?\\n\\nFabian: Oh, Papa!\\n\\nBrennan: Stomping out of a gold archway is the most piraty fuckin\\' pirate you\\never seen in your life, tri-corner hat, eye patch, saber at his side, a long\\ncoat. In this weird 1950s suburb, he sticks out like a fuckin\\' sore thumb.\\nYour father made his wealth by means that some call heroic and others would\\ncall… uh, evil, but those are, anyone\\'s gonna talk about someone who\\'s\\nachieved greatness. He swaggers out onto the patio and says,\\n\\nBill: My dear darling boy, there he is! The apple of my eye, my pride and joy!\\n\\nFabian: Oh, Papa.\\n\\nBrennan: He grabs your head and kisses you on both cheeks and goes,\\n\\nBill: Now, today is your first day of school, all right. Now, I never had much\\nin the way of book learnin\\', never was raised in no school of any kind, so,\\nhere\\'s what you do on your first day, all right? Now I\\'ve asked around. You\\nfind the biggest and meanest man there.\\n\\nFabian: Yes, Papa.\\n\\nBill: Go up to him, and you drive your fist hard and strong right into his\\nstomach and send him to his knees!\\n\\nFabian: Yes, Papa! That\\'s what I\\'ll do, just like you would\\'ve done if you\\never went to school.\\n\\nBill: That\\'s right, my sweet boy. Now, I have a little present for you, if\\nyou\\'re so inclined.\\n\\nFabian: [full of love] Oh, Papa.\\n\\nBrennan: You see he reaches into a bag and pulls out a red and white Aguefort\\nletter jacket for the bloodrush team, the Aguefort Owlbears.\\n\\nFabian: [screams in delight] Ah, Papa!\\n\\nBrennan: He hands it to you and says,\\n\\nBill: [loud, excited] Oh my boy, my sweet boy! [at normal volume] Now,\\ntechnically, you\\'re not on the team yet. They\\'re going to have some informal\\ntryouts today, mainly for people that are comin\\' back and have played earlier\\nthis season. [speaking confidentially] Now, you\\'re a freshman, but I\\'ve had a\\nlittle bit of a conversation with Coach Daybreak, who is the coach of the\\nOwlbears over there, and I understand he\\'ll be accommodating you in terms of a\\ntryout today.\\n\\nFabian: Oh, fantastic, Papa. Thank you so much, I mean, the tryout’s just a\\nsimple formality, I mean, we both know that I have the skills to be a\\nchampion.\\n\\nBill: Of course, are you--of course! You\\'re my son, you\\'re a direct reflection\\nof me.\\n\\nFabian: Yes!\\n\\nBill: You and your glory is the same as my glory.\\n\\nFabian: [emphatically] Yes it is!\\n\\nBill: That\\'s how we relate to each other.\\n\\nFabian: Exactly, Papa!\\n\\nBill: That\\'s our goal--\\n\\nFabian: Yes!\\n\\nBill: Now, in addition to your skill and your talent and your raw power as a\\nmaster of combat, I\\'ve also paid a handsome sum of money to Coach Daybreak, a\\nbribe.\\n\\nFabian: [slightly disappointed] Ah.\\n\\nBill: A bribe.\\n\\nFabian: Well, of course.\\n\\nBill: An illegal bribe.\\n\\nFabian: I would do the exact same-\\n\\nBill: Of course.\\n\\nFabian: I would have done it if you hadn\\'t.\\n\\nBill: What do we say is the relationship between luck and talent?\\n\\nFabian: 500 gold pieces.\\n\\nBill: [laughs] Ah, my sweet boy! [intensely] I love you.\\n\\nFabian: I love you.\\n\\nBill: I love you.\\n\\nFabian: I love you.\\n\\nBrennan: You see, he grabs your head and kisses you on the forehead and he\\nlooks over. You see that your mom is just, literally, winking at Herzon and\\nwaving over at him--\\n\\nEmily: Oh my god, I love her!\\n\\nBrennan: -and you see he goes,\\n\\nBill: My darling wife! I\\'ll be dead in the grave and she\\'ll still be alive.\\n\\nFabian: [quietly] I know that, Papa.\\n\\nBill: You know I\\'ll die before you, long before.\\n\\nFabian: Yeah.\\n\\nBill: The elven blood in you.\\n\\nFabian: You tell me every day.\\n\\nBill: Time ticks away, grain of sand by grain of sand.\\n\\nFabian: Yes, Papa. Yes, of course, of course it does.\\n\\nBill: We cannot live forever. So what must we do to live forever? Write our\\nname on the face of the world with our heroic deeds.\\n\\nFabian: [even more quietly] Yes, yes, of course, Papa. Write my name on the\\nface of the world with heroic deeds, yeah, I will.\\n\\nBill: Good, that\\'s all, that\\'s all it is.\\n\\nFabian: Okay, great, thank you.\\n\\nBill: [normal volume] Now get yourself to school.\\n\\nFabian: Okay, thanks, Papa.\\n\\nBrennan: We are going to cut now to another one of our brave adventurers. Oh\\nboy, oh boy! We\\'re gonna cut over now to the neighborhood of Elm Valley.\\n\\n[inspiring gospel music plays]\\n\\nPlayers laugh and dance as Brennan and Ally raise and wave their arms as if at\\na worship service.\\n\\nBrennan: [full of conviction, as if giving a sermon] Oh Lord, save us! We are\\ncutting over to Elm Valley now, where we\\'re going to go and meet our wonderful\\nfriend. It\\'s her first day of school at Aguefort, it\\'s Kristen Applebees.\\nKristen Applebees, you\\'re in your bedroom right now, you\\'ve got an emblem of a\\ncob of corn in praise to Helio, the god of corn, and his father, Sol, the god\\nof the sun. You have been touched by his spirit divine. You have been sent to\\nthis world to share the healing power of your god, amen!\\n\\nAlly: It\\'s true.\\n\\nBrennan: You see, describe your character, and what they look like, what their\\nroom is like, what\\'s kind of going on.\\n\\nAlly: Yeah, Kristen Applebees is always wearing a tie-dye shirt from a summer\\ncamp that she went to, like a religious summer camp. She has red hair,\\nfreckles, she\\'s like, was made for camp. She walks around with her leather\\nBible that has her name engraved on the cover. She\\'s always holding it. And\\nyeah, she\\'s big into the corn god.\\n\\nBrennan: You hear a bunch of noise. You have a one story, kinda like ranch\\nhouse, a little, that kind of like, Elm Valley is a super conservative\\nneighborhood. Out in the living room there\\'s a sofa and a playpen for your\\nlittle brothers. You hear your little brothers, Bucky, Bricker, and Cork are\\nall out, just rolling around on the ground. Their school starts a little bit\\nlater than yours does. And you hear your dad, Mac, and your mom, Donna,\\nyelling out there, saying,\\n\\nDonna: [suburban mom voice] I swear to God, Bricker, if you don\\'t give your\\ndad back his halberd you\\'re not gonna be able to play when you get home, all\\nright? Now say your prayers, wash your hands and get ready to get to school!\\n\\nBrennan: You hear a knock on the door. And you hear the voice of your mom say,\\n\\nDonna: Kristen, you up in there? You almost ready to go to school sweetheart?\\n\\nKristen: Sure am. I\\'m, I just finished praying.\\n\\nBrennan: You see the door opens, and you see your mom leans her head in. Your\\nmom\\'s sort of a thickset woman. She\\'s got those little sort of short-sleeved\\nmom shirt and the shorts. She\\'s got some hiking boots on. Your mom and dad are\\nhuman paladins. They work for the border patrol, going and making sure that\\npeople from the Mountains of Chaos and monsters don\\'t get in. You see your mom\\nsays\\n\\nDonna: All right, say your prayers to the corn god, Helio, praise be.\\n\\nKristen: I am. I\\'m almost done. Just another hour.\\n\\nDonna: All right, okay, we\\'re gonna be pretty late if you were gonna do a\\nwhole hour.\\n\\nKristen: I, okay, I guess I can; everything is a form of prayer, so I guess\\nI\\'ll just go. Let\\'s go.\\n\\nBrennan: You see your mom gets a little misty eyed and she says,\\n\\nDonna: Oh, sweetheart, I am so glad that you were chosen and Pastor Amelia is\\nso proud of you. Listen, it\\'s not too late for us to send you to Sun Peak to\\ngo train with the-\\n\\nKristen: No, Mom! I wanna rub shoulders with real people. I wanna go to\\nparties and dump my beer down the sink and refill the beer can with water so\\nno one feels weird around me.\\n\\nDonna: Gotcha. Look,\\n\\nBrennan: You see, she says,\\n\\nDonna: Look, Helio asks us to live a pure life, right? I just, you\\'re gonna be\\ngoin\\' to a school with elves and-\\n\\nKristen: [lowers her voice] Mom, I think your and dad\\'s stance is racist.\\n\\nDonna: [indignant] I, [scoffs] okay.\\n\\nKristen: [voice slowly raises] You\\'re only for humans who look like you, have\\nyou ever looked at all your friends, Mom? Do any of \\'em look different?\\n\\nDonna: How can I be racist against an elf? I never met one! I never met, I\\ndon\\'t even know an elf!\\n\\nKristen: Exactly, you\\'ve never met one.\\n\\nDonna: Okay, okay, so this is---\\n\\nKristen: You know what? If Helio was here right now, he would pop out of a\\ncorn husk, he would pop into a million different pieces of himself, and he\\nwould spread those pieces around to all parts of the city. He wouldn\\'t just be\\nhangin\\' out here.\\n\\nDonna: [cornered] I, I, I, I, I, okay. [sighs] [defeated] You know, I\\'m not\\nsmart enough to go toe to toe with you Kristen.\\n\\nKristen: [groans]\\n\\nDonna: I\\'m a simple woman, and you know, I haven\\'t read the book as close, I\\'m\\nnot chosen, so-\\n\\nKristen: You\\'re really smart, Mom, okay? I love you and I think you\\'re really\\nsmart, and I think you\\'re relying on “I don\\'t know” very much, and I wanna\\nhear you never say that again.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that your Dad pokes his head and says,\\n\\nMac: [low, mumbling dad voice] Everything all right in here? We\\'re about to\\nhead out, or-\\n\\nKristen: Yeah, we\\'re fine, I\\'m gonna go meet all my elf friends.\\n\\nMac: The hell? You got elf friends already? What the hell happened-?\\n\\nKristen: I hope so! I hope I don\\'t even have one human friend.\\n\\nDonna: [raises hands] All right, well you know everything, you can talk to\\nHelio, so you know, you would know.\\n\\nBrennan: You get piled into a station wagon. You can see your little brothers\\nbouncing around in the backseat. Your dad turns the elemental rune key that\\nstarts the engine up and you guys start heading off. You see your brother,\\nCork, who\\'s your littlest brother and he goes,\\n\\nCork: [nasally kid voice] You goin’ to \\'Venture School?\\n\\nKristen: Mmmhmm.\\n\\nCork: You gonna fight a dragon?\\n\\nKristen: I hope so.\\n\\nCork: Really?\\n\\nKristen: Mmmhmm.\\n\\nCork: You\\'re so cool. [wipes his nose and sniffs wetly]\\n\\nKristen: Thanks. Do you want a tissue? Do you wanna a wet nap? Do you wanna\\ntissue?\\n\\nCork: Huh? [snorts] I\\'m good.\\n\\nKristen: No.\\n\\nCork: I\\'ve got a crayon up there.\\n\\nKristen: What?\\n\\nCork: I got a whole crayon.\\n\\nKristen: You have a whole crayon in your nose? Here. [reaches over and yanks\\nit out] Oh god! [gingerly holds it in disgust before setting it down] Jesus.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that a small bit of light covers his nose.\\n\\n[heavenly string fanfare plays]\\n\\nDonna: What, you heal your brother back there?\\n\\nKristen: Yes.\\n\\nDonna: Well, you know what? I got no worries about you.\\n\\nBrennan: You guys take off! [rolls a die] Ooh baby, here\\'s the next one.\\n[looks to Zac]\\n\\n[quiet contemplative string music plays]\\n\\nBrennan: Do you feel it?\\n\\nZac laughs softly. He tilts his head, rests it on his hand. Cast laughs.\\n\\nMurph: [laughs] Oh, okay.\\n\\nBrennan: [quietly] So, it\\'s pretty early. It\\'s a misty gray kind of morning\\nover in Little Branch. Little Branch is the area of town where the small folk\\nlive. There\\'s a lot of miniature houses over there, and we see over in a\\nlittle corner of a neighborhood, sort of far away, there\\'s a tree, and it\\'s a\\ntree with a little door in it and there\\'s little windows and little pulleys\\nand kites and all kinds of things of gnomish make, clever little contraptions\\nand wonderful things and, there, in the middle of the tree, standing up from a\\nbed that fills up the entire tree at almost, sort of a slant, even, the face\\nsort of pressed up against the windowsill, is Gorgug Thistlespring. Gorgug,\\ncan you tell us sort of what you look like and what you\\'re doing right now?\\n\\nZac: [quiet and stilted, like a shy teenager] Uh, yeah. I\\'m Gorgug, I\\'m 14.\\nI\\'m six feet, four inches tall. I\\'m a lot bigger than this house that I\\'m in.\\nI kinda don\\'t have a lot of friends. I\\'m not good, really, at talking to\\npeople. I like keeping to myself and just sort of drawing or something or\\nlistening to music. I\\'m adopted, by the way, uh, my parents are little gnomes,\\numm, and I\\'m a lot bigger than them. Last night I broke my bed in my sleep.\\nAgain. [sighs] I just like to keep to myself.\\n\\nBrennan: Well, Gorgug is there in his gray hoodie. He\\'s got his headphones on,\\nlistening to some music.\\n\\nGorgug: [sighs]\\n\\nMurph: Evanescence, no doubt.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that it\\'s pretty early and you see that coming in from the\\nworkshop, your adoptive mom and dad, Digby and Wilma Thistlespring are\\ntinkerers, and you see they come in. Your dad\\'s kinda got these like mutton\\nchops and he\\'s bald. He\\'s got these sort of goggles on. Your mom\\'s kinda like\\nthe little, sort of, workshop bandanna around her head, and they both have\\naprons on and have their little curly, pointed shoes. You see your dad and mom\\nboth walk in, and your mom goes,\\n\\nWilma: [sweet, high, with a whistle] Well, hey there, sweetie, you\\'re already\\nup.\\n\\nGorgug: Yeah, I got up pretty early. I broke my bed again.\\n\\nWilma: Oh, sweetheart, that\\'s no problem! Aww, and on the first day of school.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that your dad immediately goes over and starts doing some\\ngnomish spell, takes up a hammer and starts [magic tinkles] mending it with\\nmagic,and you see he says,\\n\\nDigby: [slightly lower than Wilma, slight Southern lilt] Hey, you know what?\\nSometimes a thing gets broken, and when you rebuild it, it\\'s stronger for it,\\nyou know? A lotta things are like that. You put a sword in a steel forge, you\\ngotta beat the hell outta that thing to get it nice and hard and sharp, you\\nknow? Breaking things isn\\'t bad.\\n\\nGorgug: I mean, you keep saying that, but I keep breaking things.\\n\\nDigby: It\\'s always good, it\\'s always good that you\\'re break, you know-\\n\\nGorgug: I had a weird dream where I got really mad, and then I woke up and my\\nbed was broken.\\n\\nDigby: Okay.\\n\\nGorgug: So you guys have dreams where you\\'re mad all the time?\\n\\nBrennan: You see that Digby and Wilma look at each other and go,\\n\\nWilma: Well, sure, sure.\\n\\nGorgug: Really? I was just thinking about, I\\'ve never seen you mad.\\n\\nWilma: Well, you didn\\'t see me when your old Pa here dropped a screwdriver on\\nmy dang thumb. I was fit to, you know, I said, “Hey,” you know, “watch it,\\nbuster!” He really got it.\\n\\nGorgug: You were so mad and you said, “Hey, watch it, buster”?\\n\\nWilma: Well, yeah.\\n\\nGorgug: I feel like my insides are boiling.\\n\\nWilma: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\n\\nGorgug: When I\\'m mad. I\\'m not mad right now.\\n\\nWilma: Okay, that\\'s, hey, you know what? Everybody gets mad sometimes, and you\\nknow, one thing you can think about when you\\'re going to school is “Hey,\\nthings aren\\'t going my way, I\\'m getting pretty PO\\'d. You know what I\\'m gonna\\ndo? I\\'m gonna sing a song.”\\n\\nGorgug: Sing a song?\\n\\nBrennan: Your mom grabs a little harp and your dad grabs a little ukulele and\\nthey start sort of harmonizing, and they go like,\\n\\nThistlesprings: [singing cheerfully]\\n\\n♪ When you feel a little mad ♪\\n\\n♪ It\\'s probably because you really feel sad ♪\\n\\n♪ Just remember your mom and dad ♪\\n\\n♪ And then you\\'ll start to feel real glad ♪\\n\\nGorgug: [joining in] -real glad. ♪\\n\\nWilma: That\\'s right.\\n\\nDigby: That\\'s right, bud, so just sing that song around the other high\\nschoolers if you start feeling upset.\\n\\nGorgug: Okay, I gotta go.\\n\\nBrennan: You see, Gorgug, you walk out, you see your mom by the door, hands\\nyou a little tin flower. And you see, she says,\\n\\nWilma: [earnestly] Now, another thing, that back at Oakshield you had, you\\nknow, it was a little bit of a hurdle trying to, it was a bit, we had a little\\nbit of a hard time trying to make pals, right? But making pals is just like\\nmaking a flower, you know, you think-\\n\\nGorgug: [in disbelief] It\\'s just like making a flower?\\n\\nWilma: Sure, everything\\'s\\n\\njust\\n\\nlike something else. You just-\\n\\nGorgug: [hurriedly] Please don\\'t sing another song.\\n\\nBrennan: You see your dad softly puts his ukelele, put that down, you see your\\nmom goes,\\n\\nWilma: Well, with a flower, you think, “Hey, what should that thing look like?\\nAnd how would I make it, and what would I do?” And you\\'re thoughtful, and\\nthen, and then you\\'re real careful with it, and then you put the work in and\\nyou put the elbow grease in and you do it with love the whole time. And if you\\njust go be yourself, be your great good self with your great big heart, I just\\nknow you\\'ll make some friends, bud.\\n\\nGorgug: Okay, thank you, Mom. I\\'ll go to school and I\\'ll try to make a friend\\ntoday.\\n\\nWilma: [gesticulating] Maybe give ‘em the flower!\\n\\nGorgug: I don\\'t-- [sighs] [he reaches for the flower]\\n\\nWilma: Maybe give ‘em the flower! You know-\\n\\nGorgug: Thanks for the flower.\\n\\nWilma: That could make a friend.\\n\\nGorgug: I\\'m gonna buy a friend with a flower?\\n\\nWilma: Well, it\\'s not buying- a gift isn’t buying, you know? A gift isn\\'t\\nbuying something. You know, when you give someone a compliment, is that buying\\nsomeone something? You give someone a smile? Give someone a smile? You ever do\\nthat?\\n\\nGorgug: [reluctantly attempts to smile]\\n\\nWilma: Wow, yeah, them tusks, them tusks are really comin\\' in, bud.\\n\\nGorgug: [grimacing] They\\'re so big.\\n\\nBrennan: [laughs] We\\'re going to cut now, let\\'s see here, ooh boy. We will now\\ngo little bit north of here to Clearbrook.\\n\\n[bright classical string music plays]\\n\\nEmily laughs and looks over at Siobhan, who smiles slightly and straightens\\nher posture.\\n\\nMurph: Oh my goodness.\\n\\nBrennan: [adopting a snobbish tone, enunciating every syllable] Here in the\\nneighborhood of Clearbrook, we now venture through the lofty woods and the\\nshaded streets to the Abernant residence, where we find ourselves at the\\nbreakfast table with Mr. Angwyn Abernant, Mrs. Arianwen Abernant, Miss Aelwyn\\nAbernant, and Miss Adaine Abernant, at a small breakfast nook with crystalline\\nwindows, small spinning elven pylon of pure runic magical energy, small unseen\\nservants, little air elementals whisk eggs and tea and other things like that\\nto the table back and forth. You see that your father, the elven diplomat from\\nFalinel, reads the paper and ruffles it. Your mother, a professor at Hudol,\\nlooks down at her tea and goes over her curriculum for the day, and your older\\nsister, prim, proper and perfect in her Hudol uniform, sits next to you. [to\\nSiobhan] Describe your character to us, if you\\'d be so kind.\\n\\nSiobhan: [in her native British accent, quiet and anxious] I\\'m Adaine\\nAbernant, I\\'m the daughter of the elvish ambassador. I was at… [sighs] Hudol,\\nbut unfortunately, I failed the entrance exam to get into the upper school\\nbecause I had... a little bit of a panic attack. [unconvincingly] But\\nAguefort\\'s good too, Aguefort\\'s, I\\'m happy to be at Aguefort, that\\'s good.\\nIt\\'s like actually, I\\'m better at the practical applications of magic anyway,\\nand I\\'m good I, I, I, it\\'s good, I\\'m excited to go.\\n\\nBrennan: So at the table, you see that your father sort of ruffles the paper\\nand says,\\n\\nAngwyn: [business-like, recieved British baritone] Hoo, ghastly business,\\nthat. I\\'m sure this will come out at our next meeting at the council, it\\'s\\ndreadful, that\\'s really dreadful. [clears throat]\\n\\nAdaine: I hate it when you do that.\\n\\nAngwyn: What\\'s that?\\n\\nAdaine: You say a thing is dreadful but you don\\'t say what it is.\\n\\nAngwyn: Do you want to know?\\n\\nAdaine: I don\\'t know!\\n\\nAngwyn: Adaine, an inquiring mind is one that sees before it the opportunity\\nfor knowledge and strives to move forward. Your sister, Aelwyn, for example, I\\ntrust that when she wants to know something she will ask. That\\'s the mind of a\\nresearcher rather than sort of the responsive, more... visceral attitude of a\\npractical caster, you understand.\\n\\nAdaine: If you really wanted us to know things, you\\'d get us papers ourselves,\\nexcept you sit here and you say, “Oh gosh, terrible! Oh drat! What a thing!”\\nand then I have to ask you, instead of you saying, “Oh look, here\\'s some\\nactual practical information that you might want to know.”\\n\\nBrennan: You see, your sister says,\\n\\nAelwyn: [posh] I get the paper on my crystal, do you not? I get it on my\\ncrystal.\\n\\nAdaine: I\\'m not allowed a crystal because I failed the entrance exam.\\n\\nAelwyn: That\\'s right. You\\'re not allowed a crystal. Well, I\\'m sure if you kill\\na hobgoblin maybe you\\'ll... What are the sort of things they do at Aguefort?\\nI\\'m not sure.\\n\\nAdaine silently stares at Aelwyn for a few moments and pointedly turns away.\\n\\nAelwyn: It\\'s an honest question. Do you kill hobgoblins at this-\\n\\nSiobhan: I cast Ray of Sickness underneath the kitchen table.\\n\\nBrennan: You see your sister goes [scoffs] and vomits all-\\n\\nAdaine: Oh dear. I mean, I think that maybe my sister is too sick to go to\\nschool today--\\n\\nAngwyn: Now, now, children. No offensive spell casting at the nook. That\\'s\\ngoing to take a whole prestidigitation to clean up. Arianwen, do you want to\\ndo that?\\n\\nArianwen: [lofty, dismissive scholarly tone] Very well, Father.\\n\\nBrennan: Your mother swirls her hand and says,\\n\\nArianwen: Adaine, I don\\'t understand why you and your sister can\\'t simply get\\nalong?\\n\\nAdaine: Why don\\'t you ask her? Why do you always ask me?\\n\\nArianwen: Well, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t choose to examine that. I\\'m rather busy,\\nI\\'m trying to get this curriculum today.\\n\\nAdaine: Yes, of course, you\\'re rather busy for me.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that she looks over at your father, immediately ignoring that\\nvery pointed statement that you just made, and says,\\n\\nArianwen: Dear, do tell me what you see in the news.\\n\\nBrennan: He says,\\n\\nAngwyn: Well, the Elven Oracle has died in a shipwreck. Very dreadful\\nbusiness. On her way from Fallinel to Bastion City, looks like her ship, the\\nCerulean, just went down. Dreadful affair. Ought to be dealing with that. I\\'m\\nsure the arch magi will have no end of talking about what\\'s to be done.\\nTerrible.\\n\\nAdaine: She can\\'t have been that good an oracle if she didn\\'t see the storm\\ncoming.\\n\\nArianwen: [appalled] Adaine!\\n\\nAdaine: I, what, why?\\n\\nBrennan: You see, Aelwyn goes,\\n\\nAelwyn: [resentfully, while wiping vomit off of her chin] Now, really, Adaine,\\nthat\\'s much too much. [muttering to herself] Oh God, this stinks.\\n\\nAdaine: I\\'m just saying.\\n\\nBrennan: Your sort of breakfast includes, your father gives you a very chaste\\nkiss on the head and your sister. You see your mother gets up and says,\\n\\nArianwen: [distractedly] I trust that you girls will see yourselves...\\n\\nBrennan: She says,\\n\\nArianwen: Aelwyn, if you\\'d like to take the car you can do that, and Adaine, I\\nunderstand that there\\'s a bus that goes to Aguefort?\\n\\nAdaine: I mean, other people\\'s parents might have found that out for them.\\n\\nArianwen: Well, I think this is a very wonderful time for you to apply some of\\nyour divination casting, perhaps gaze into a crystal ball, see if the bus is\\ncoming to a certain place. That\\'s sort of the thing they value there, isn\\'t\\nit?\\n\\nAdaine: [resigned] Very well, I shall find my own way to school.\\n\\nArianwen: That\\'s my good girl.\\n\\nBrennan: She kisses you on the head. You get your stuff and get ready to head\\nout. You\\'ve got kind of this little prep uniform as well. Your father walks\\nover to you and says,\\n\\nAngwyn: Oh, Adaine, before you go, I\\'d like to give you something.\\n\\nBrennan: You see he takes this big crystal orb out from a satchel, you see he\\nsays,\\n\\nAngwyn: This is an arcane focus that an old friend of mine, a warcaster from\\nthe military in Fallinel employed for his spellcasting. I\\'ve had no use for an\\narcane focus, but I understand you\\'ll be spellcasting under adverse\\nconditions, so perhaps it would be of some use to you.\\n\\nAdaine: Thank you, father.\\n\\nAngwyn: Oh, you\\'re very welcome. Here you are.\\n\\nAdaine: It\\'s very, it\\'s very big.\\n\\nAngwyn: What\\'s that?\\n\\nAdaine: Thank you.\\n\\nAngwyn: Why would it be impractical to fight with a two foot diameter orb?\\nWouldn\\'t a large orb, it helps you focus the spell energy. I\\'m trying, Adaine,\\nI really do try my best. I don\\'t know what to tell you, Adaine, this is a\\ntouching gift from a friend of mine. You don\\'t like it, you can give it back,\\nthat\\'s fine.\\n\\nAdaine: No, I, thank you, thank you, Father. I\\'ll put it in my backpack. I\\nguess.\\n\\nAngwyn: I don\\'t think it\\'ll fit, but try your best.\\n\\nAdaine: Then I will, I\\'ll carry it in my hands to school on my first day of\\nschool. I\\'m sure it will make a great impression with these new people.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that your father ducks away. You and Aelwyn start walking,\\nand you see that she looks over at you, and she says,\\n\\nAelwyn: That was a mean trick with the vomit and all that, I don\\'t ever cast\\nspells at you.\\n\\nAdaine: Yes you do, all the time.\\n\\nAelwyn: Well, mine are always funnier, you know, they have an ironic sort of\\ntwist.\\n\\nSiobhan: I cast Tasha\\'s Hideous Laughter.\\n\\nBrennan: Make a saving throw, if you\\'d be so kind, for Tasha\\'s Hideous\\nLaughter.\\n\\nSiobhan: Oh.\\n\\nBrennan: What\\'d you roll?\\n\\nSiobhan: A 4. Do I have points to add to it, that-\\n\\nEmily: Does she reverse it at her?\\n\\nBrennan: That she does.\\n\\nEmily: Oh, ho ho ho! That\\'s badass. Sorry, your sister’s a fucking badass.\\n\\nSiobhan: [laughing] So I’m just going into school laughing like a crazy\\nperson.\\n\\nMurph: Your sister is so cool.\\n\\nSiobhan: Oh no.\\n\\nLou: I love your sister.\\n\\nEmily: Your sister’s so smart and quick.\\n\\nAlly: Your sister’s so cool.\\n\\nEmily: And on top of it, her, her uniform is just slightly better fitting.\\n\\nBrennan: Make a Wisdom roll for your Wisdom save.\\n\\nSiobhan: 4, plus wisdom.\\n\\nBrennan: Plus wisdom, 4’s not gonna do it.\\n\\nSiobhan: Great.\\n\\nBrennan: You start cackling like a lunatic. I’m also gonna need to have you\\nmake a wisdom saving throw for your panic attack condition.\\n\\nSiobhan: [sighs deeply] 20. 18 plus 2.\\n\\nBrennan: 18 plus 2. Cool, so you don\\'t go into a panic attack but you do start\\nlaughing like a lunatic. You see, she says,\\n\\nAelwyn: See, for example, I just said that my spells were funny, and I\\'ve\\nturned your laughter spell back on you, which is both ironic and funny, which\\nare the two things that I said my spells are like. And I didn\\'t even have to\\nuse a spell slot, isn\\'t that something-\\n\\nAdaine: I\\'m going to learn so many spells and screw you, this is my only game\\nin going to this school, to find a group of people to destroy your fucking\\nlife.\\n\\nBrennan: You see she says,\\n\\nAelwyn: I\\'m sure you will, you\\'re going to join one of those little arcane\\nsecret societies, go voodoo-\\n\\nSiobhan: I punch her in the face.\\n\\nBrennan: Go ahead and make an attack roll.\\n\\nEmily: Did you use up all your spell slots on your sister?\\n\\nMurph: You just die in your opening.\\n\\nSiobhan: 3.\\n\\nBrennan: 3, you, boy, your skinny elven fist biffs right past her face, and\\nshe says,\\n\\nAelwyn: That sort of pure brute physical violence, I\\'m sure that\\'ll earn you\\nall sorts of credit at this school for brawling, that\\'s lovely. Well done,\\n\\nBrennan: You see she says,\\n\\nAelwyn: Could I, before you injure yourself by trying to attack me, could I\\njust be very clear about something? Look--\\n\\nBrennan: She says,\\n\\nAelwyn: I, it\\'s awful that you got kicked out of Hudol. It\\'s awful, it doesn\\'t\\nreflect well on our family, but that\\'s not even the reason.\\n\\nSiobhan: I punch her in the face again.\\n\\nBrennan: [laughs] Go for it again.\\n\\nSiobhan: 8.\\n\\nBrennan: 8\\\\. She says,\\n\\nAelwyn: Really, stop! What\\'s to gain at this point by throwing punches?\\n\\nAdaine: The game is me hitting you in the face.\\n\\nAnd so she says,\\n\\nAelwyn: I\\'m trying to help.\\n\\nAdaine: No, you\\'re trying to help yourself.\\n\\nAelwyn: You know, look, all right, and just let me do, I\\'m trying to do a nice\\nolder sister thing for once. Can I do it, can I do that?\\n\\nAdaine: Can you?\\n\\nAelwyn: [sighs] Good grief, all right. Look, Aguefort doesn\\'t work like Hudol,\\nall right, so all the things about grades and tests and practicals and exams\\nand all that, that\\'s all out, it\\'s a nonsense place. It\\'s all topsy turvy\\nthere, all right? They look differently on the sort of things that they value\\nthere, so the things that really really work for that academy are, sort of,\\nthings that would be insane to do at Hudol. I heard that one of the best ways\\nto get into an arcane society was to steal a book from the restricted section\\non your first day, that that\\'s something that they look at as, I don\\'t know,\\nsome kind of adventurer\\'s initiative or it shows, I don\\'t know, gumption?\\n\\nAdaine: I don\\'t want to take any more advice from you, \\'cause you probably\\ncouldn\\'t even get into Aguefort. Just because you\\'re good at Hudol doesn\\'t\\nmean-\\n\\nAelwyn: I couldn\\'t get into Aguefort?\\n\\nAdaine: That you\\'d be good at Aguefort.\\n\\nAelwyn: I could get into Aguefort.\\n\\nAdaine: You\\'d be terrible at Aguefort.\\n\\nAelwyn: I\\'d turn that whole school around, brick by brick. I\\'d lift it up in\\nthe air-\\n\\nAdaine: You\\'re too scared to try. You\\'re too scared to try.\\n\\nAelwyn: I am proper and well-behaved and well-mannered.\\n\\nAdaine: [childishly] Meh, meh, meh, meh.\\n\\nAelwyn: So I don\\'t care to engage in this anymore.\\n\\nAdaine: [mocking her] Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.\\n\\nAelwyn: All right, fine, go on your first day, get partnered up with some sort\\nof barbarian, go out into the wilds and get killed on your first adventure,\\nsee what I care?\\n\\nAdaine: Good, I shall.\\n\\nBrennan: You see she turns and walks away.\\n\\nEmily: Whoaaa.\\n\\nLou: Tension.\\n\\nBrennan: Hell yeah. Ba-ba-bum, we now go over to,\\n\\n[smooth jazz music plays]\\n\\nZac smiles and looks over at Murph as Emily points over to Murph as if to say,\\n“it’s you!”\\n\\nMurph nods and grooves to the music.\\n\\nAlly: [nodding appreciatively] Oh yeah, oh yeah.\\n\\nSiobhan: Oh yeah.\\n\\nBrennan: Welcome to Ballaster, which is kinda like [rumbly, gravelly voice]\\nmore rundown, more seedy kinda place, kinda bad part of town. You see\\nStrongtower Luxury Apartments, with the luxury kind of arcano-crystal\\nflickering, [neon light buzzes] so it just goes ke-ke-ke, Strongtower\\nApartments. We see that there is a small bedroom and basically, a kind of\\nretrofitted, it\\'s in a one bedroom apartment with a kind of cordoned off bed\\nin the living room with a fake drywall around it. Very small apartment. And we\\nsee that there is, sun\\'s just coming up, there\\'s some smoke coming from some\\nburning thing on the oven, and there\\'s a little bit of coffee in a mug. A very\\nsparse, spartan kinda place, and we see Riz Gukgak. Brian, go ahead and\\ndescribe Riz for me, if you\\'d be so kind.\\n\\nMurph: [in a clear voice, ever so slightly nasally] Yeah, so I\\'m Riz Gukgak.\\nMy nickname in middle school was Briefcase Kid. I\\'m a goblin, and I don\\'t have\\na lot of friends even though I\\'m pretty social, which is weird. My only real\\nfriend is this halfling named Penny Luckstone who, technically my babysitter,\\nI had a babysitter until I was 13, but she recently went missing, and my mom\\nis a detective and I\\'m a [coughs] licensed private investigator, so I am gonna\\nfind Penny myself.\\n\\nBrennan: So it\\'s early morning, I assume you\\'ve been up all night working your\\ncase.\\n\\nMurph: I\\'ve got my board. It just has the missing girls all just pointed at\\nthe school.\\n\\nEmily: Eww! That\\'s so creepy to have in a little boy\\'s room.\\n\\nAlly: Just have a board of missing girls.\\n\\nMurph: He\\'s trying to find them.\\n\\nEmily: Whatever, creep.\\n\\nAlly: Yeah, whatever.\\n\\nMurph: [pointing at them] You\\'re not here, you\\'re not here, none of you are\\nhere.\\n\\nAlly: You know, you take breaks and kiss a pillow.\\n\\nEmily: “Oh, Penny, babysit me.”\\n\\nMurph: Riz is there not kissing a pillow. Just being a private investigator.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that it\\'s early in the morning, you\\'re kind of looking at the\\nboard. It\\'s a lot of, it\\'s a really nice board, you’ve got the yarn and\\neverything. It\\'s kind of sparse clues-wise, it\\'s sort of just the pictures and\\nthe dates where they went missing and stuff like that.\\n\\nMurph: I’m trying to move it around to make it different, but I only have like\\nfive clues.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that the door opens and your mom, Sklonda Gukgak walks in.\\nSkonda is a classic goblin, she\\'s got sort of green skin, yellow eyes, the big\\nears that come out to each side, but has got that classic mom haircut, you\\nknow what I mean? Kinda like the bangs and the kind of bob or whatever?\\nDressed with the, sort of white shirt, she\\'s got an underarm holster for a\\nlittle arquebus, dress shoes, she\\'s always gotta have the badge hangin\\' off of\\nthe belt there. You see that she opens the door, walks in. She\\'s been gone all\\nnight working. And you see, she walks in and she goes,\\n\\nSklonda: [clearly tired] Oh, Riz, sweetie, are you, you\\'re up? What are you\\ndoin\\'?\\n\\nRiz: I kind of, I got some sleep. I slept for four hours, we said four hours\\nwas the minimum.\\n\\nSklonda: Four hours is the minimum.\\n\\nRiz: I got four hours of sleep.\\n\\nSklonda: Okay.\\n\\nRiz: And I got up a couple times to work on the board, but for the most part,\\nfour hours of sleep.\\n\\nSklonda: Sweetie, you know that it\\'s not great that you\\'re doing this, right?\\n\\nRiz: Well, they\\'re missing, mom.\\n\\nSklonda: [picking up card] Why does this say licensed private investigator?\\n\\nRiz: Well, it says “un-”, it\\'s little, but it\\'s legal.\\n\\nSklonda: Looks like a smudge, oh, sweetie, that\\'s, that\\'s-\\n\\nRiz: Technically legal.\\n\\nSklonda: -really skirting the line with a lie.\\n\\nRiz: But, overall, okay.\\n\\nSklonda: I, look, sweetheart. You’ve gotta lotta gumption, but we have\\ndetectives that are working, actually we have one detective working this case,\\nbut-\\n\\nRiz: And I can be your man on the inside.\\n\\nSklonda: Man on the inside?\\n\\nRiz: Yeah, that Ague-- the school, right? That\\'s where, the girls all went to\\nthe school.\\n\\nSklonda: Yes, they all went to Aguefort.\\n\\nRiz: And that\\'s the clue that I have.\\n\\nBrennan: She looks at your one clue, that they all went to Aguefort, she says,\\n\\nSklonda: Okay, you could throw a couple more clues on there, that\\'s a probable\\nthing, we could, you know-\\n\\nRiz: Just read a newspaper?\\n\\nSklonda: Yeah, we\\'ll just read a newspaper, the dates, right, what kind of\\ncircumstances, last seen, last person seen.\\n\\nRiz: That\\'s why it\\'s good to have you around, Mom.\\n\\nSklonda: Why am I encouraging this? Don\\'t do this. Oh god, okay, you\\'ve eaten?\\nAre you hungry, want something to eat?\\n\\nRiz: Um, I had coffee.\\n\\nSklonda: That\\'s not food, sweetie.\\n\\nRiz: I haven\\'t eaten, okay, I could use something.\\n\\nSklonda: Okay, I\\'m gonna go get something, what do we have?\\n\\nBrennan: You see she opens the fridge, it\\'s empty. She goes,\\n\\nSklonda: Oh yeah, I gotta go shopping.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that she opens the thing and there\\'s some cereal. She takes a\\nlittle thing of cereal out, pours two bowls, pours some milk in. You see that\\nthere\\'s not enough milk for two bowls, so then she pours the milk out of her\\nbowl into yours.\\n\\nEmily and Ally aww, Siobhan visibly looks sad, Zac lowers his head, Lou covers\\nhis face.\\n\\nBrennan: Puts water from the sink in her-- she puts it in front of you, and\\nyou see that she has-\\n\\nAlly: Don’t cry! Don’t cry!\\n\\nMurph: Who has the time-\\n\\nEmily and Zac pantomime crying.\\n\\nSiobhan: She’s trying her best!\\n\\nAlly: I love her. [raises two fingers in a salute] Shout out, moms.\\n\\nBrennan: You see she says-\\n\\nSklonda: All right, well, eat up, okay?\\n\\nRiz: Okay, thank you.\\n\\nThe two eat ravenously, making comical gobbling noises.\\n\\nSklonda: [wipes chin] Ah, all right, well I\\'ll go, I\\'ll find a time to go\\nshopping and get the rest. [sighs] Hey, today, first day of school, right?\\n\\nRiz: Yep.\\n\\nSklonda: And this Saturday, y’know, uh, umm, it\\'s the five year anniversary,\\nso if you wanna head over to the cemetery, we can go visit Dad, sort of see\\nhow things are going.\\n\\nRiz: Yeah, yeah, we can do that.\\n\\nSklonda: Does that work for you?\\n\\nRiz: Yeah.\\n\\nSklonda: We can go in the morning, if you got stuff to do, ‘cause I know you\\nprobably try to make friends at school-\\n\\nRiz: Yeah, I\\'m probably gonna be busy, \\'cause I gotta make-- So I figured a\\nlotta kids would just be giving out their phone numbers on their phone, but I\\nmade business cards.\\n\\nSklonda: [inhales, wincing] Buhhh.\\n\\nRiz: So I\\'ll probably be busy Saturday.\\n\\nSklonda: Okay.\\n\\nRiz: Why don’t we do it in the morning.\\n\\nSklonda: Ah, sweetheart, yeah. Y’know, formality is great when you\\'ve tryin\\'\\nto be a professional, and I know that you’ve seen me work a lot, and so that\\'s\\nkind of a, you know, professionalism. But there\\'s something to be say, you\\nknow, when I go out with the guys, I\\'ll knock back a beer-\\n\\nRiz: Right, right.\\n\\nSklonda: I\\'ll kick back a little bit. Y’know, It\\'s okay to relax.\\n\\nRiz: Yeah, get \\'em relaxed.\\n\\nSklonda: Get who? Get them relaxed?\\n\\nRiz: That\\'s how we get them to tell us-\\n\\nSklonda: You relax.\\n\\nRiz: Tell us the secrets so that we-\\n\\nSklonda: It\\'s not, okay-\\n\\nRiz: So that we can solve the mystery.\\n\\nSklonda: Friends are for more than clues, sweetie. Friends are for, there\\'s a\\nlot of things we use friends for. Right, so let\\'s look at that as an\\nopportunity to-\\n\\nRiz: Start with the friends, then get the clues.\\n\\nSklonda: Okay. Well, I\\'m gonna, you good to get to the bus?\\n\\nRiz: Yeah.\\n\\nSklonda: I\\'m gonna try to, I\\'m gonna catch a little bit of sleep. Sweetheart,\\nyou\\'re gonna do great.\\n\\nRiz: Thanks, Mom.\\n\\nSklonda: You\\'re the best there is. I love you, have a great day at school.\\nTell me all about it when you get home, okay?\\n\\nRiz: Okay. Thanks, Mom.\\n\\nBrennan: She gives you a kiss on the head, she heads off to her bedroom. And\\nwe will now cut over to our final--\\n\\n[rock music plays]\\n\\nPlayers bob their heads.\\n\\nMurph: Nice.\\n\\nBrennan: [ready to rock] Ah, hell yeah, we cut over to the Faeth Home way over\\nby the highway, not too many people live out here, it\\'s kind of a little, has\\na chain link fence, it\\'s got a little attic bedroom up there.\\n\\nEmily: Oh, I\\'m in the attic?\\n\\nBrennan: You\\'re in the attic.\\n\\nEmily: Fuck yeah.\\n\\nBrennan: Fuck yeah. Upstairs is a room that last year was filled with pastels\\nand unicorns, other shit like that, and now it\\'s all fuckin\\' band posters,\\ntour lists for who\\'s gonna be playin\\' at the Black Pit. There\\'s a sick red\\nguitar in the corner. There\\'s some horn cream, there\\'s some cream for your\\nhorns that are coming in. You see, Emily, go ahead and describe your character\\nif you would.\\n\\nEmily: [teen girl] Um, my name\\'s Figueroth. You probably knew me last year as,\\nlike, that really bubbly girl who was, like, invited to every party, but all\\nof the sudden, my horns started growing in and I thought I was an elf, but it\\nturns out, my dad isn\\'t my real dad and I have a demon for a dad, but my mom\\nwon\\'t tell me who he is. So pretty much I\\'m kinda like, fuck everyone and I\\'m\\njust like, I\\'m just like, I\\'ve got a bass guitar, I\\'ve got some drumsticks,\\nlike, I\\'m ready to start a bass-driven band. And, just like, yeah, just fuck\\neverything, right? Okay, that\\'s it. That\\'s me. Also, my name is Figueroth, my\\nlast name is Faeth, but that is the name of someone who does not have anything\\nto do with me because he\\'s not my dad. So I\\'m just Fig now. Just Fig.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that, so Fig is upstairs, you see that there\\'s a knock at the\\ndoor. You\\'re in bed. You see that your mom leans in. Your mom is a, she\\'s got\\nthe mom jeans on, but is like a sort of wood elf. You see that she\\'s got a bow\\nover her shoulder and a quiver of arrows, your mom works as a ranger that goes\\nand explores the woods around here. You see she goes,\\n\\nSandra Lynn: [no nonsense tone] Sweetheart, I\\'ve been knockin\\' up a storm,\\nwhat\\'s goin\\' on? You\\'re gonna be late,you\\'re gonna miss the bus.\\n\\nFig: Oh yeah, um, about that, I\\'m not going.\\n\\nSandra Lynn: God damn it. You\\'re going to school.\\n\\nFig: Yeah, try and tell me even one good bard who learned how to bard in\\nschool. They\\'re gonna teach me how to play the bass guitar? No, if I want, I\\nneed real life experience.\\n\\nSandra Lynn: The school is real life experience.

Wow, where did this come from? You were so well behaved a\\nyear ago.\\n\\nBrennan: You see she sort of collapsed against the wall.\\n\\nSandra Lynn: Look, okay, well,\\n\\nBrennan: and she looks out the window and goes,\\n\\nSandra Lynn: Well, there goes the fuckin\\' bus, huh? There it goes, you happy?\\n\\nFig: Bye. [waves at the bus] Anyway, so I think I\\'m just gonna sorta stay home\\nand work on some music. I\\'ve got a song called My Dad is a Demon But He\\'s Also\\na Deadbeat, so I\\'ll just work on that. Bye.\\n\\nSandra Lynn: You\\'re going to the school.\\n\\nBrennan: And you see that she walks out, picks up the phone and she calls\\nsomeone, you can hear her speak in Elven downstairs.\\n\\nFig: I can\\'t believe that I really thought I was an elf.\\n\\nSandra Lynn: [speaking elvish, lots of “th” and “l” sounds]\\n\\nFig: Elves are so lame.\\n\\nSandra Lynn: [more elvish]\\n\\nFig: Oh my god, just so many -th soundings.\\n\\nSandra Lynn: [more elvish]...

She leaves. You see that she walks out on\\nthe front lawn and a humongous griffin flies up in the sky going [screams],\\nlands in the front yard and she mounts on its back and flies off.\\n\\nLou laughs and claps.\\n\\nEmily: Okay, that\\'s pretty dope.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that a moment later a car rolls up and Gilear, who you, not\\nyour biological father but the man who raised you, steps outta the car. He\\'s\\nnot looking great. He\\'s sort of lost some hair. You\\'ve never seen an elf with\\na comb over before. He\\'s got a little bit of a paunch. He\\'s got a little, sort\\nof short-sleeved button up shirt, he\\'s working at a different job now, \\'cause\\nhe quit his old one, and he\\'s got what look like beans or something on his\\nshirt. He steps outta the car and knocks on the door, tock tock tock.\\n\\nEmily: I go answer it.\\n\\nFig: Gilear, have you been eating out of cans again?\\n\\nGilear: [low, halting voice] What? My daughter, yes, ehm, I have been eating\\nlegumes as it were for I have found that in my new living situation over at\\nStrongtower Luxury Apartments--\\n\\nFig: Wow, you really emphasized luxury.\\n\\nGilear: They\\'re not the worst in the world. They\\'re all right, but I\\'ve found\\nthat it\\'s, you know, yeah, I\\'ve been eating beans. Eating beans.\\n\\nFig: Okay. I, so I\\'m guessing you were sent here to try and get me to go to\\nschool, right?\\n\\nGilear: Well, I\\'m gonna give you a ride.\\n\\nFig: Okay, let me just go use the bathroom and then I\\'ll come.\\n\\nGilear: Okay, that sounds good.\\n\\nEmily: I go into the bathroom and cast Disguise Self to make myself look like\\nmy mom. And then I come back out.\\n\\nBrennan: You walk back out, and you see he goes,\\n\\nGilear: [annoyed] Uh, Sandra Lynn, what the hell? I thought you needed to go\\nto work?\\n\\nFig: [slightly deeper voice] I know, I\\'ve changed, I\\'ve changed my mind. I\\ndon\\'t think she should go to school. She made some really compelling arguments\\nabout how bards, how bards need real life experience so. Thank you so much.\\nAnd also, thank you for keeping it a secret who her real dad is.\\n\\nGilear: Well, all right.\\n\\nFig: But between you and me, we can say the name out loud.\\n\\nBrennan: You see he says,\\n\\nGilear: Well, he\\'s actually, if you wanna go talk to him about the paternity\\ntest, he\\'s free today.\\n\\nFig: Yeah. Yes, I do. Can we do it in the next hour?\\n\\nGilear: Sure, that\\'s fine.\\n\\nFig: Okay, yes.\\n\\nGilear: Yeah, that\\'s no problem.\\n\\nFig: Thank you. Thank you so much. She\\'s upstairs so we can just go, no need\\nto say goodbye to her.\\n\\nGilear: Really? No need to say goodbye to her?\\n\\nFig: No, I think she\\'s working on a song.\\n\\nGilear: Okay, that\\'s all right. I\\'ll talk to her later.\\n\\nBrennan: You see he goes and gets in the driver’s seat of the car.\\n\\nFig: Okay, I\\'m coming.\\n\\nBrennan: You sit. What\\'s the duration on your Disguise Self spell?\\n\\nEmily: One hour. [laughs]\\n\\nBrennan applauds.\\n\\nZac: Foolproof.\\n\\nBrennan: Foolproof, foolproof.\\n\\nAlly: Foolproof.\\n\\nBrennan: Cool.\\n\\nMurph: Everyone else goes to school, that’s the adventure.\\n\\nBrennan: The sun rises in the sky over the beautiful dappled lawns, stone\\nbrick walls, ivy-covered trellises and statues of the Aguefort Adventuring\\nAcademy. All of you arrive by bus, by car, however you get here. Out in the\\nfront of the building, you see a bunch of students, people that recognize each\\nother are clapping and loud teenagers, and everyone\\'s kind of gathering.\\nYou\\'re a few minutes early. [to Emily] You see that your father pulls up to\\nthe front of the school.\\n\\nEmily: [panicked] Oh no!\\n\\nMurph: [delighted] You got tricked!\\n\\nBrennan: You see he goes,\\n\\nGilear: [scornfully] All right, Sandra Lynn, here you are! Your former lover\\'s\\nin there.\\n\\nFig glances at him, hoping her cover wasn’t blown.\\n\\nGilear: Oh, you think I\\'m a fool?\\n\\nFig: [groans in disappointment]\\n\\nGilear: I raised you. And don\\'t call me Gilear, all right? I know that I said-\\n\\nFig: What, what else am I supposed to call you? Stranger, stranger with no\\nbiological link to me? I\\'m willing to make, that\\'s a lot to say every time I\\naddress you.\\n\\nBrennan: You see a little tear forms in his eye and you see he says,\\n\\nGilear: I know that I said some hurtful things when I first found out.\\n\\nFig: Yeah, you said, “You\\'re no longer a Faeth,” and guess what, I\\'m not. I\\'m\\njust Fig now.\\n\\nGilear: Fig, I\\'m sitting here with beans on my shirt.\\n\\nFig: I know, I saw you ate one on the ride here.\\n\\nGilear: I was hungry, all right? I\\'ve put on some weight. You ever heard of a\\nfat elf? You ever heard of it? I\\'ve never seen a fat elf in my life and I\\'m\\nhere with a bad comb over and beans on my shirt.\\n\\nFig: Okay, fine.\\n\\nGilear: And I\\'m reaching out to you.\\n\\nFig: I\\'m sorry, Gilear, I\\'m sorry that I got angry at you. You\\'re just some\\nrandom man, I shouldn\\'t be mean to you.\\n\\nGilear: All right, get outta my fucking car, you demon!\\n\\nFig: [gasps]\\n\\nGilear: I didn\\'t mean it like, it\\'s not, no no, \\'cause you\\'re making it a\\ntiefling thing.\\n\\nFig: You know what, I am a demon!\\n\\nEmily: And then I put some horn wax to really make \\'em shine.\\n\\nFig: And I\\'m not ashamed of it. I just hope I don\\'t also get a tail. The horns\\nare enough, okay, bye.\\n\\nBrennan: You guys all arrive at the foot of the school.

You\\nfucking, yeah, Gorgug whips up and fucking clocks you.\\n\\nGorgug: [yells]\\n\\nKristen: Wait, no! Violence isn\\'t the answer.\\n\\nEmily: Is this creating like a commotion?\\n\\nBrennan: Oh yeah.

You guys see that wading through the crowd of students\\nis this hulking dragonborn, right?

You see he\\'s\\nholding just a straight up cricket bat in his hands, and he walks up and goes\\n\\nGoldenhoard: [deep rumbling voice] All right, all right that\\'s enough! And on\\nday one, the bell hasn\\'t even rung yet.\\n\\nBrennan: Effortlessly hoists you two up off the ground, sheathing his cricket\\nbat before he does so, and goes,\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Now look here, where, where, what are you, freshmen? How, why did\\nthis even start?\\n\\nFabian: Well-\\n\\nGorgug: [upset] I don\\'t know! He hit me.\\n\\nFabian: Well, I had to let this one know that I wasn\\'t going to take any of\\nhis shit.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: “Shit”? It looks like he\\'s holding a flower.\\n\\nFabian: Hey, the greatest attackers sometimes put up a facade, that they might\\nsneak their way. I don\\'t need to explain myself to you, I\\'m Fabian Seacaster!\\n\\nGoldenhoard: You 100% need to explain yourself to me. I am Vice Principal\\nGoldenhoard.\\n\\nGorgug: [to Fabian] I\\'m sorry I got mad at you. You can still have the flower\\nif you want.

All right. That\\'s immediate detention for both of\\nyou. First day, after school.\\n\\nFabian: [huffily] Fine.\\n\\nBrennan: All right, you see he gives you each a little red slip then says,\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Good grief, is there any other nonsense happening here? [pause]\\nGood, behave yourselves. I\\'ll see you in detention after school.\\n\\nGorgug: [to Fabian] I\\'m so sorry.\\n\\nBrennan: Rad.

You can just like, partially see\\nthrough, or ethereal, and you see it says “Ghost steak, please do not eat, for\\na ghost professor”.\\n\\nEmily: Um yeah, I\\'m gonna eat that. I take the ghost steak and I just start\\neating it.\\n\\nBrennan: You have a very fuckin\\' hard time grabbing it.\\n\\nFig: [attempting to grab it] Fuck, fuck.\\n\\nBrennan: You see the door opens and this Vice Principal guy walks in and goes,\\n\\nGoldenhoard: [stares in disbelief] Okay. Immediate detention. We are three for\\nthree, and it\\'s, I mean, I\\'m about to ring the first bell.\\n\\nFig: [waving her cigarette] The crazy thing is, you\\'re just playing into my\\nhand. Welcome to my game, and you just did exactly what I wanted you to do.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: I, I, I, I don\\'t know you, right? This is baffling.\\n\\nFig: I know, that\\'s why I was able to two-step around you.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Describe your two-step to me. How have you bamboozled me in this\\nmoment? Walk me through how you\\'ve bamboozled me.\\n\\nFig: All right, my plan all along was to get caught so I would get kicked out,\\nand you are just scooting me along.\\n\\nEmily: I put my combat boots up on the table.\\n\\nFig: What\\'s the deal with that steak? I can\\'t pick it up.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Right, it\\'s for ghosts, that\\'s ghost food. Now, I\\'m gonna be very\\nhonest with you. I don\\'t think you fully know what detention means. You\\'re not\\nsuspended.\\n\\nFig: Do you recognize me?\\n\\nBrennan: You see, he looks at you and says,\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Uh, no?\\n\\nFig: \\'Cause last year I was on the cheer squad.

They\\'re\\nboth seniors, and you see that they\\'re handing out little fliers that have\\nballots attached to them, and you see that the young woman, who\\'s sort of\\nhalf-elf, again, has got sort of the long, sort of brunette hair, a little\\nflower tied into it, is going,\\n\\nPenelope: [high perky voice] Hi, we\\'re voting today to reinstate prom king and\\nqueen, Hi, we\\'re voting today, we\\'re having a vote today.

Umm…\\nListen, I don\\'t know if you have enough space to carry this with that giant\\norb you\\'re carrying, but this is, it\\'s a little ballot, we\\'re basically having\\na vote, because for a long, long time, it\\'s like never, Aguefort hasn\\'t had a\\nking and queen at prom, and me and my boyfriend Dayne are trying to, like,\\nI’m, like, part of the yearbook club, and we\\'re basically trying to, like, get\\nthat back, like, bring that tradition back.\\n\\nAdaine: What does that mean? What does being prom king and queen mean?\\n\\nPenelope: Well, there\\'s a vote, right, that has, if enough students say they\\nwant it, we\\'ll do a, like a vote and people can vote for prom king and queen,\\nand they\\'ll, like, have a special dance and it\\'ll be really fun.\\n\\nAdaine: [confused] They just get a special dance, that\\'s what that means, is\\nthat-?\\n\\nPenelope’s smile fades.\\n\\nAdaine: Yeah, okay, I\\'ll vote. Yeah, I don\\'t really understand.\\n\\nPenelope: If you vote for it, and just like, as an aside, it\\'s gonna be a lot\\neasier for you here at Aguefort, \\'cause I can tell you\\'re a freshman. It\\'s\\ngonna be a lot easier if you ask less questions, \\'cause, like, probably, like,\\nit\\'ll become clear the more time you spend-\\n\\nAdaine: [under her breath] That\\'s actually “fewer questions”.\\n\\nPenelope: Sorry?\\n\\nAdaine: [shakes head] No, okay, I\\'ll sign it.\\n\\nBrennan: Dayne looks at the other guy and says,\\n\\nDayne: [eyes half closed] Babe, it\\'s fewer questions, less questions is wrong,\\ngrammatically.\\n\\nBrennan: You see she\\'s like,\\n\\nPenelope: Fine, Dayne.\\n\\nBrennan: She says,\\n\\nPenelope: Okay, so why don\\'t you just, like, take the ballot-\\n\\nAdaine: Yeah, I\\'ll take it, I\\'ll take it, thank you.\\n\\nPenelope: And you can vote-\\n\\nAdaine: Yeah, I\\'ll vote. Where do I, where do I, where do I vote?\\n\\nPenelope: There\\'s little boxes out in front of the assembly which we\\'re going\\nto now.\\n\\nAdaine: Oh, great.\\n\\nPenelope: Welcome.\\n\\nAdaine: [smiles hesitantly] Thank you.\\n\\nPenelope: Cute outfit, it\\'s like, it’s like, you go to a different school than\\nhere. [fake smiles] Fun! Let me know if you need help stashing that orb.\\n\\nAdaine begins to have trouble breathing.\\n\\nBrennan: So you guys walk along. You see that at that main hall, this guy\\ncomes over and he\\'s this big human wearing sweatpants, got a little baseball\\ncap and a whistle around his neck and a giant glowing spear with holy light.\\nYou see that he claps Dayne and Ragh on the back. You see that, he, Ragh is\\nlooking at you [points to Murph] in the trash can and the guy goes like,\\n\\nCoach Daybreak: [folksy] Ah, there are my boys, there are my bruisers, there\\'s\\nRagh and Dayne, heck yeah!\\n\\nBrennan: You see he looks around at the two players, and he looks over at you,\\n[points to Ally] and you recognize him from church, from the Cathedral of Sol.\\nAnd you see he goes,\\n\\nDaybreak: Ah, that\\'s great, Kristen! What are you doing here?\\n\\nKristen: Oh, I go here now, it\\'s my first day. Good to see you!\\n\\nDaybreak: Ah, it\\'s great to have you, kiddo, that\\'s great, I love that.\\n\\nBrennan: I\\'m gonna need you to make an opposed Athletics check.\\n\\nAlly: Great. Uhhhh, what is, where\\'s Athletics? Oh, 2, 7.\\n\\nMurph: We\\'re all just getting our asses kicked.\\n\\nAlly: Yeah, yeah.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that you are shoved to the ground and your backpack goes\\neverywhere and your Bible sort of spills out of your hand.\\n\\nKristen: No!\\n\\nBrennan: And you see that there is a tall, looks like an elf, but his skin is\\ndeathly pale. He’s got black hair hanging, and he\\'s got a mesh shirt with a\\nbelt, kind of diagonal across it, and sort of bondage pants, like, used for\\nthat kind of Hot Topic look, and you see he\\'s got a rat on his shoulder. And\\nhe\\'s got spiderweb designs on some fingerless gloves. And you see he goes,\\n\\nZayn Darkshadow: [moody] What\\'s up, cleric? How\\'s it going?\\n\\nKristen: Did you do that on purpose?\\n\\nZayn: I don\\'t know. Did God curse us to live on purpose?\\n\\nKristen: Ooh, let\\'s see, let\\'s start from the beginning, okay? Any curse you\\nmay feel is probably human-made, because we were all made just a little bit\\noff.\\n\\nZayn: Oh, I know I was made off. My heart is fuckin\\' broken.\\n\\nKristen: Okay, look.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that the coach helps you up and hands your Bible to you and\\ngoes like,\\n\\nDaybreak: Hey, Zayn, do me a favor, pal and beat it, huh? Why don\\'t you beat\\nit?\\n\\nBrennan: You see that Zayn says,\\n\\nZayn: I don\\'t know, why don\\'t we all just beat it?\\n\\nBrennan: He turns into bats.\\n\\nKristen: I\\'ll pray for you, Zayn!\\n\\nBrennan: You see that the coach shakes his head and he goes,\\n\\nCoach: That kid is a piece of work. He got kicked out of the theater\\ndepartment and he\\'s taking it hard.\\n\\nKristen: Who gets kicked out of the theater department? That\\'s where you go\\nwhen you\\'re kicked out of anywhere else.\\n\\nDaybreak: Yeah, exactly. He\\'s having a hard time. But hey, it\\'s really good to\\nhave you here. And you know, if you ever need anything, come talk to me. I am\\nhappy to help you out, all right?\\n\\nKristen: Yeah, thanks, it\\'s good to see you.\\n\\nDaybreak: Good to see you too, and wait, you can\\'t say it too loud, \\'cause\\nthere\\'s a bunch of people of all kinds here, but praise be to Helio, huh? Go\\ncorn god.\\n\\nKristen: Yes, yeah. Praise be to Helio.\\n\\nBrennan: You guys all leave this place and end up in the assembly hall. It\\'s a\\nbig auditorium, you guys are all there together. Riz, I assume you get out-\\n\\nMurph: I’m covered in trash. I couldn\\'t get it all off.\\n\\nBrennan: You guys gather, and you see a man step out in a purple corduroy\\nsuit, and he\\'s got an umbrella. Very dark dark skin, and a monocle, and this\\nlong white beard that goes past his waist. He\\'s got a little watch fob and a\\nmonocle on a little chain, and you see that he steps out to the podium, you\\nsee he produces, as if from air, a little saucer with a teacup on it and steps\\nto the podium, being introduced, of course, first by, from off stage,\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Ladies and gentlemen, your principal, Mr. Arthur Aguefort!\\n\\nRiz claps, looks around and stops clapping. Kristen looks up and claps.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that the sort of this old wizardly man steps out and says,\\n\\nAguefort: [old wizard voice, strained] [quiet dramatic music plays in the\\nbackground] Welcome, one and all to another exciting year here at the Aguefort\\nAdventuring Academy, where we train the next generation of adventurers.\\n\\nAnd what is an adventurer? One who goes on adventures. I say that an\\nadventurer is a hero, and what is a hero? A hero is someone with the strength\\nof heart, courage of spirit, and the might of will to go to strange lands and\\nenact violence on things there. We go to places where there are things that\\nmust be destroyed, and we destroy them. Wandering from town to town, getting\\ninto trouble, meeting in drop houses and taverns and getting into scrapes with\\nthe law and otherwise finding ourselves engaged in all matters of tomfoolery\\nand shenanigans, sometimes violent, sometimes fatal. Yes, fatal, and a hero is\\na violent wanderer who enacts their will bodily and with strange magicks upon\\nthe world.\\n\\nBut does a hero truly stand alone? Ha ha ha, no, the strength of the hero is\\nthe strength of the party, and what is a party? A gathering of friends,\\nperhaps with some alcoholic beverages, some fun music, ha ha ha, a jape! For\\nall of you, a party is a group that comes together to embellish each other\\'s\\nstrengths and eradicate each other\\'s weaknesses. A party is composed of those\\nwho have sworn themselves to each other, to make themselves greater than the\\nsum of their parts.\\n\\nPerhaps we have flaws within us, perhaps we don\\'t cast magic and we need\\nsomeone who can cast magic to help us when we need magic. Perhaps we\\'re very\\ntough and we can sustain a lot of injuries, but we need somebody who is very\\ngood at hurting people there with us as well. Perhaps we need a sneaky person\\nto sneak. Not always, sometimes you don\\'t need that, but occasionally, in\\ncircumstances where you do need one, you really need one, right, with traps\\nand other things like that.\\n\\nThat is the meaning of party, and party is the meaning of hero. Never forget,\\nall of you, [drinks his tea] Ugh, it\\'s bad. Never forget that the greatest\\nmagic of all is chronomancy, the magic of time. Welcome to your first year,\\nfreshmen, at the Aguefort Adventuring Academy!\\n\\nBrennan: He turns into light, and disappears.\\n\\nKristen claps.\\n\\nEmily: My hand was on the fire drill the whole time, to pull it, but I was so\\nmoved by that that I actually took it off.\\n\\nZac: I was looking for a pencil that whole time.\\n\\nEmily: Yeah, it was really cool.\\n\\nBrennan: After that, a bunch of different classes open up. You see that\\nGoldenhoard sort of says,\\n\\nGoldenhoard: We have some orientation events today for those that are\\ninterested in matters of the arcane,we\\'ll have an arcane orientation happening\\nin room 212. We\\'ll also have a number of tryouts and battle orientations and\\nthings of that nature. Please file out, obviously we don\\'t want to corral you\\ninto a class without your own choosing, so be wise and find the best fit for\\nyou. Very well! Enjoy, students.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that students begin to sort of file off, the freshmen, at\\nleast, sort of filing off towards the different orientations and things like\\nthat.\\n\\nEmily: I wanna find lunch lady Doreen.\\n\\nBrennan: Cool, yeah, you can go find lunch lady Doreen, you go over to the\\nlunch and you see the lady Doreen there, a thin sort of looking woman with a\\nlittle cigarette hangin\\' out of her lip. She looks over at you and as you walk\\ninto the cafeteria and goes,\\n\\nDoreen: [deep, raspy voice] Oh, lunch is not served for awhile, sweetheart.\\n\\nFig: No, I came to talk to you, because I feel like you have the only honest\\nprofession here and, also, you\\'re allowed to smoke at work which I think is\\nreally cool.\\n\\nDoreen: I\\'m not allowed to smoke at work.\\n\\nFig: Oh. Well, but you do it anyways, which shows that you have a spirit that\\nI really admire. So I was wondering, maybe I should just be taking classes\\nwith you.\\n\\nDoreen: You wanna be a lunch lady?\\n\\nFig: Maybe.\\n\\nDoreen: Okay.\\n\\nFig: I just respect what you\\'re doing. Everyone else is trying to do all these\\nlofty things, and you\\'re just being you. You\\'re just so true compared to\\neveryone else.\\n\\nDoreen: Okay.\\n\\nFig: So real.\\n\\nDoreen: Okay, you wanna do, you wanna work?\\n\\nFig: Mmmm.\\n\\nBrennan: You see she tosses a crowbar to you and says--\\n\\nEmily: I don\\'t, I just let it drop.\\n\\nDoreen: There\\'s an industrial, we gotta buncha drums of creamed corn off the\\nback of a tr-\\n\\nFig: Drums?\\n\\nDoreen: Yeah, y’know, like a drum?\\n\\nFig: Yeah, okay cool, yeah. I\\'ll go work with that.\\n\\nDoreen: Yeah, yes, it must have fallen or something, \\'cause the corn was all\\ndinged up so I had a fucking hardtime opening that thing, but you\\'re welcome\\nto go try.\\n\\nFig: Wait, so that you\\'re having\\' a hard time opening the drum, there\\'s a big\\nold drum right? There\\'s a bunch of drums? Presumably-\\n\\nBrennan: She points to a bunch of metallic oil drums in the back, like big\\nmetal canisters.\\n\\nEmily: Cool yeah, I just go there and start playing the drums.\\n\\nBrennan: She looks over and she goes,\\n\\nDoreen: What the fuck are you doin\\'? What the fuck are you doin\\'?\\n\\nFig: Music isn\\'t, music isn\\'t confined to the stage at the Black Pit, you\\nknow, it\\'s anywhere.\\n\\nBrennan: Make a Performance check.\\n\\nEmily: Whoo, yeah! Oh come on, hook me up, 17.\\n\\nBrennan: It gets really STOMP in here, and you see that she goes like,\\n\\nDoreen: Okay, okay, that is a little funky, that\\'s good, I like it. You know,\\nI wasn\\'t always a lunch lady, I used to get around when I was young.\\n\\nFig: Oooh!\\n\\nDoreen: Ah, we’ll talk about it sometime. Listen, you got a gift for that.\\nYou\\'re really talented.\\n\\nFig: Thank you, I know that I\\'m not gonna learn any of that here, I\\'ll learn\\nstupid stuff. Well, actually, I kinda liked everything the guy was saying.\\n\\nBrennan: You see she says,\\n\\nDoreen: You know, you might be right, there might not be much of you to learn\\nhere, but you know what,it\\'s not gonna hurt you to go see what the bullshit is\\nthey\\'re sellin\\', right? Why not go check in on the enemy, see what all the\\nskwalesare talking about.\\n\\nFig: Oh, shit, there\\'s so many good role models here. I\\'m gonna take you up on\\nthat.\\n\\nDoreen: Hey, you\\'re a real sweet kid, come back anytime.\\n\\nFig: I will, I bet I\\'ll come back once a day.\\n\\nDoreen: All right, oh, because you eat lunch in this room.\\n\\nFig: Yeah.\\n\\nDoreen: Yeah, that makes sense.\\n\\nFig: Yeah.\\n\\nDoreen: Okay, you have a good one, sweetie.\\n\\nFig: Okay, bye Doreen.\\n\\nDoreen: You can call me Doreen. [blows a kiss]\\n\\nFig: Okay, bye Doreen.\\n\\nBrennan: Adaine, you are walking past the library, as you are walking past it,\\nroll a Perception check.\\n\\nSiobhan: 12?\\n\\nBrennan: You notice a very old, sort of a very old woman human librarian, who\\nhas a little velvet rope and closes it over a little restricted section, and\\nyou see that there is a book lying on a little table right near the entrance\\nof the restricted section.\\n\\nSiobhan: Umm. [inhales] Is it light enough that I can use Mage Hand?\\n\\nBrennan: You need an Investigation check to try to clock the weight of the\\nobject at this distance. [die clatters]\\n\\nSiobhan: 16?\\n\\nBrennan: Yeah, for sure.\\n\\nSiobhan: Great, I cast Mage Hand as her back is turned and I take the book.\\n\\nBrennan: The book zips from the restricted section of the library. The book\\nthat now rests in your hand is titled Wards and Watches, and it\\'s an\\nabjuration book, it\\'s a very very powerful abjuration book.\\n\\nSiobhan: Great, I very quickly put it in my backpack, and then I panic, \\'cause\\nI\\'m like, why am I doing this, nobody can see me do this, my stupid sister\\njust told me to do this and I don\\'t know why I\\'m doing it, and now I have a\\nbook that I\\'ve definitely stolen and I can\\'t tell them that I\\'ve stolen it.\\n\\nBrennan: Please make a panic attack check, like a-\\n\\nSiobhan: 5.\\n\\nBrennan: You go into a full blown panic attack.\\n\\nAdaine: Shit, oh god, oh my god.\\n\\nAlly: I come up.\\n\\nBrennan: You wind up in the hallway, yeah.\\n\\nKristen: Hey are you okay?\\n\\nAdaine: [struggling to breathe] No.\\n\\nFig: I saw what you did and I thought it was pretty awesome.\\n\\nAdaine: [labored breathing] Oh god, no, the goth kid thinks I\\'m cool.\\n\\nFig: That was so cool.\\n\\nKristen: Oh, I like your giant orb. Here, let me make it glow.\\n\\nAlly: I cast Light on her giant orb.\\n\\nBrennan: You are now glowing in the middle of a crowd of children. Vice\\nPrincipal Goldenhoard walks up and goes,\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Very nice use of the Light cantrip. What is your name, young\\nstudent?\\n\\nKristen: Oh, I\\'m Kristen Applebees.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Kristen Applebees, wonderful to meet you. I\\'m Vice Principal\\nGoldenhoard.\\n\\nKristen: Oh, hi.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Young lady, are you all right?\\n\\nAdaine: [very softly] I found this book.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: You found-\\n\\nBrennan: Make a Bluff check for me, with disadvantage.\\n\\nSiobhan: What\\'s dis-- what what?\\n\\nBrennan: You roll two D20 and take the worse result.\\n\\nSiobhan: Okay, great.\\n\\nZac: Oh my god, a 20 and a 2.\\n\\n[shouts of dismay]\\n\\nMurph: That\\'s just a 2.\\n\\nBrennan: Just a 2, I’m afraid! You see that Vice Principal says,\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Sorry, you found a book?\\n\\nFig: She\\'s covering for me, I stole it and she caught me stealing it.\\n\\nAdaine: [stammering] No, I didn\\'t, I didn\\'t, she didn\\'t steal, I stole it, I\\'m\\nso sorry, I, I was, I was, I was t... I\\'m sorry I\\'m new, I don\\'t know what I\\'m\\ndoing.\\n\\nKristen: We all fall short of the grace of God.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: [to Kristen] Mm, you know I wouldn\\'t, that\\'s a bit strong for\\nthis, I would say, that\\'s a bit strong. [to Adaine] This is not appropriate,\\nthat you\\'ve done this. [to Kristen] Kristen, would you mind taking the book to\\nPrincipal Aguefort\\'s office for me?\\n\\nKristen: Yeah, sure.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Go ahead, take the book.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that he looks at you and says,\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Now, young lady, what was your name?\\n\\nAdaine: Adaine Abernant.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Miss Abernant. Oh yes, you come to us from Hudol. I\\'m afraid I\\'m\\ngoing to have to give you detention. So you\\'ll be staying late after school\\ntoday. Do you understand? All right, this is not fun for me. You\\'re clearly\\nhaving a bad time. I\\'m second guessing what I\\'m doing, even as I\\'m doing it,\\nwondering if there\\'s some medical stuff going on that I don\\'t know about,but\\nI\\'m going to do it, as I\\'ve already talked out loud and other students can\\nhear this.\\n\\nFig: Yeah, I can hear it all, hi.\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Hey, for real, we\\'re not gonna do this. You think we have a\\nthing,but that\\'s where you\\'re wrong. We don\\'t have a thing. You have a thing.\\n\\nFig: Who\\'s running detention?\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Good grief, all right, you are going to detention, here\\'s your\\nslip, hands you the slip.\\n\\nLou: Bloodrush trials?\\n\\nBrennan: Bloodrush trials, yes! Let\\'s do it, we are all on the field, baby.\\nEveryone\\'s out there, Dayne Blayde is out there, Ragh Barkrock is out there,\\nand you see that Coach Daybreak is out there as well. You see that, what you\\ndo is you approach the pitch.\\n\\nFabian: Well, uh, hello comrades!\\n\\nBrennan: Everyone looks at you wearing the letter jacket.\\n\\nFabian: Dayne, good to see you,saw you and your friend deal with that little\\ngoblin earlier. Oh hohoho, good stuff. That was miraculous, you just crushed\\nhim up, Ball! That\\'s, I like that. I\\'ll call him Ball when I see him.\\n\\nDayne: Oh, okay, what\\'s your--\\n\\nBrennan: Dayne speaks up and says,\\n\\nDayne: Okay, I\\'m super confused, \\'cause you\\'re talking to me like you\\'re\\nimportant, but I don\\'t know you.\\n\\nFabian: Oh, heh heh. It\\'s my first day, you probably, I\\'m Fabian\\nSeacaster,Bill Seacaster\\'s son, the great adventurer, Bill Seacaster? I\\'m his\\nson Fabian, and I\\'m going to be on the bloodrush team, so it\\'s exciting to\\nmeet you and get to know you and-\\n\\nBrennan: Make an Insight check for me.\\n\\nLou: 15.\\n\\nBrennan: You notice that these players look to Coach Daybreak, whose jaw is\\nset as you mention your father, and you see that Dayne looks up at you, looks\\nup at the coach and sort of, all of these boys are looking off their coach\\'s\\nexpression, basically. You see that Dayne turns to you and says,\\n\\nDayne: Oh, that\\'s right, yeah, your dad\\'s the richest guy in town, right?\\n\\nFabian: [excitedly] Yes, that\\'s him.\\n\\nDayne: Yeah, pirate.\\n\\nFabian: Yes, what, I\\'m sorry,I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. Privateer, my father\\'s a\\nprivateer.\\n\\nBrennan: You see Ragh says,\\n\\nRagh: I don\\'t know what that word means.\\n\\nFabian: It means where you would, in conjunction with different enterprises\\nand things, he wasn\\'t just running around just raping and pillaging like\\npirates do, that\\'s not my father. My father worked, he was charged with tasks\\nand adventures, ah.\\n\\nRagh: For real, dude, I\\'ve never heard somebody that plays bloodrush talk like\\nyou. You\\'re using all kinda words that are just like, sphew, shwee, sphh.\\n\\nFabian: Well, I mean, yeah, I\\'m one of a kind.\\n\\nBrennan: You see Ragh says,\\n\\nRagh: Yeah, I bet you are one of a kind. One of a kind of a bad person.\\n\\nFabian: Ah, what a witty barb. That\\'s good stuff.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that Coach Daybreak leans in, says,\\n\\nDaybreak: All right, guys, we\\'re gonna have some tryouts now. Let\\'s everyone\\nlay off of Fabian here. Fabian\\'s father made his money outside of the nation\\nof Solace. Part of the laws of Solace Is that the things you did in the\\noutside world can be forgiven under the national amnesty if you swear on the\\ncharter, right, we got people that live in the forests of the Nightmare King\\nor in the Red Waste. They wanna come here and make a better life for themself.\\nThe council forgives that. They allow people to not have to live down their\\npast, even if they did all kinds of things that they\\'re still benefiting from.\\n\\nFabian: Yeah, well, it doesn\\'t matter anymore, right?\\n\\nDaybreak: That\\'s right, kid. Well, let\\'s get this tryout started, huh?\\n\\nFabian: Yes, let\\'s get this tryout started.\\n\\nBrennan: You see he says,\\n\\nDaybreak: Well,why don\\'t we start you out with some running drills, huh?\\n\\nFabian: Fantastic.\\n\\nBrennan: Go ahead and give me some Athletics checks.\\n\\nLou: Great. Oh, and a nat 20.\\n\\nBrennan: You run the fucking field on these guys. You\\'re like 16 and you are\\nfully flatlining seniors. You take Ragh Barkrock,who\\'s the huge half orc,\\nsecond in command guy, fling down to the ground, no sweat. He looked up at you\\nand says,\\n\\nRagh: This guy fuckin\\' cheated, dude, fuckin\\' cheated, man.\\n\\nFabian: Oh, Ragh, [laughs] another one of those witty barbs of yours. I did\\nnot cheat.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that he goes into a full rage and Dayne says,\\n\\nDayne: He’s doing it!\\n\\nBrennan: And jumps on him and his friends all restrain him. Coach Daybreak\\ncomes over and he says,\\n\\nDaybreak: [begrudgingly] All right, well there, fancy boy, you got some moves\\non you, I\\'ll give you that.\\n\\nFabian: Oh, uh, fancy boy, [wrinkles his nose] that\\'s a fun nickname. Is that\\ngonna be my nickname, like Ball? I\\'m Fancy Boy? I like it.\\n\\nDaybreak: Well you got a, you got real chops. Let\\'s see how you do throwin\\'.\\n\\nBrennan: You see Dayne looks up and goes,\\n\\nDayne: What?\\n\\nBrennan: You see he says,\\n\\nDaybreak: Yeah, let\\'s see how he does throwin\\', I wanna see it.\\n\\nBrennan: The coach sets up a play with people running around you, so there\\'s a\\nscrimmage, there\\'s the other side of the bloodrush field, big stone, you\\'re\\nnot on grass, it\\'s actually like a weird stone. This is actually it, right\\nthere. [points to set] The coach sets up a scrimmage where you\\'re gonna make,\\nthe idea is for you to pass to somebody, basically, you\\'re sort of\\nquarterbacking, effectively. As you get started, go ahead and make me a\\nPerception check real quick.\\n\\nLou: Critical failure.\\n\\nMurph: 20 to 1.\\n\\nSiobhan: You\\'re havin\\' a day.\\n\\nEmily: That\\'s so funny, 20 to 1. Such a great [unintelligible]\\n\\nBrennan: 20 to 1, okay, now go ahead and make me an Athletics check.\\n\\nLou: Great, that\\'s what I prefer. 22.\\n\\nBrennan: Fuck yeah. He gets you the ball and he\\'s like,\\n\\nDayne: We wanna see how you pass.\\n\\nBrennan: You... Let me roll a little opposed check. Okay. He sets you up, you\\nsurvey the field, and you see a bunch of people that you could pass to, but\\nall the people that you could pass to are kind of like losers that you just\\nfucking either clotheslined or rope-a-doped or moved around.\\n\\nLou: Of course, of course.\\n\\nBrennan: As the lines charge each other, you see a little opening that you\\ncould break through.\\n\\nLou: Oh, I\\'ll take it.\\n\\nBrennan: You charge forward. Your team looks like, what the fuck is going on?\\nYou effortlessly dodge and weave through all of the other athletes and fucking\\nget to, what do you do when you get to the end zone?\\n\\nLou: I place the ball down gently.\\n\\nFabian: Good game, I liked that, those plays went real nice, Dayne? Dayne,\\ngood stuff, my man.\\n\\nDayne: The hell, you didn\\'t throw the ball, dude.\\n\\nFabian: Well, it worked out best,I thought, for the play.\\n\\nRagh: Yeah, you know what? You didn\\'t throw the ball because you have bad\\nthoughts about what to do.\\n\\nFabian: Ragh? Ragh! This is funny. Does he, do we all, does Ragh roast us\\noften? This is fun.\\n\\nBrennan: Coach Daybreak looks at you and says,\\n\\nDaybreak: You can hit the showers, bud.\\n\\nFabian: Oh. Great, great. Does anybody, I\\'ll see all you boys on the hill.\\n\\nBrennan: Nobody else starts to leave and you notice it.\\n\\nFabian: I\\'ll meet you over there!\\n\\nBrennan: He says,\\n\\nDaybreak: You\\'re not on the team.\\n\\nFabian: I\\'m sorry. What? I\\'m sorry, what?\\n\\nDaybreak: You\\'re not on the team.\\n\\nFabian: [stammer] But I-- I ran faster and I. [quietly] My father paid you. My\\nfather paid you money.\\n\\nDaybreak: [loudly] What the hell did you just say?\\n\\nBrennan: You see all the other students look around and he says,\\n\\nDaybreak: Buddy, you got a big mouth and no heart, you will never be an\\nOwlbear.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that he goes, he takes a red slip out.\\n\\nDaybreak: That\\'s detention, pal.\\n\\nFabian: You know what, you know what, that\\'s fine. \\'Cause clearly, clearly I\\'m\\nbetter than all of you at-- at bloodrush, all right. You know what? I don\\'t\\nneed this, and I don\\'t need any of you, and you know what, Ragh, none of your\\njokes are funny. I didn\\'t like any of them.\\n\\nRagh: What the hell? That\\'s not what you said!\\n\\nBrennan: Ragh bursts into tears, and the other, Dayne goes like,\\n\\nDayne: That\\'s fucked up, dude. It\\'s fucked up to tell a guy his jokes are bad.\\n\\nBrennan: You see that coach says,\\n\\nDaybreak: Good luck. You got all the moves in the world, but it means nothing\\nif you don\\'t play on a team, kid. You\\'ll learn that the hard way.\\n\\nFabian: [dismissively] Oh, I\\'m sure I will.\\n\\nBrennan: Fabian heads off. We\\'ll move over to Riz real quick.

Oh my god, I’m just like Jesus. Just like\\nHelio.\\n\\nBrennan: You guys get in line for lunch and you start going through the lunch\\ncounter, and you see the lunch lady, Doreen, starts puttin\\' creamed corn and\\nstuff on your guys\\' trays.\\n\\nAdaine: I\\'ve never eaten a surprise before.\\n\\nDoreen: Well, it\\'s tuna surprise, very surprising. Okay, here\\'s your tray,\\nhere you go.\\n\\nBrennan: You see this tuna surprise, and you see that there are just chunks of\\nham in the tuna.\\n\\nKristen: Ooh, it\\'s sour somehow.\\n\\nMurph: Riz just gobbles it down instantly.\\n\\nFabian: Excuse me, excuse me, miss, I can\\'t eat this. Do you have something,\\nwhat are the other options? I\\'d like to eat another option.\\n\\nDoreen: Another option?\\n\\nFabian: Yeah, is there, I mean, I\\'m presuming there\\'s a menu that I can order\\nfrom, or something I can make a choice of, assuming there\\'s something else,\\nall right?\\n\\nDoreen: There\\'s no other... I could, you want me to get you, I could get you\\nketchup? I could do, uh-\\n\\nFabian: What? Miss, miss, ketchup is not a meal.\\n\\nDoreen: Would you like ketchup?\\n\\nFabian: For, as a meal?

Good, I have negative three off the bat.12.\\n\\nBrennan: Ah, cool. You see that Ragh, the half orc jock grabs your Bible out\\nof your hand and tosses it into the kitchen. And you see, it goes whoosh,\\nwhoosh, whoosh and spins and lands in a big vat of the creamed corn and sinks\\ninto it. And you see he goes,\\n\\nRagh: That\\'s what you get for boring what you, what you did, that\\'s what you\\ndid, that\\'s what you get for that.\\n\\nKristen: Good thing I already know the whole thing by heart.\\n\\nSiobhan: I cast Mage Hand and pull the book out of the creamed corn.\\n\\nBrennan: Cool. You see that as you go to start pulling the book out of the\\ncreamed corn, the book pops out, it\\'s covered in creamed corn. And there\\'s a\\nton of goop all over it. You see the lunch lady says,\\n\\nDoreen: All right, all right, everybody you all gotta go. Everybody go sit\\ndown.\\n\\nBrennan: Ragh says,\\n\\nRagh: Think about it next time.\\n\\nKristen: Who the fuck is that guy?\\n\\nRagh: Think about it.\\n\\nFabian: Don\\'t even bother. He\\'s a fucking oaf.\\n\\nKristen: A freaking idiot.\\n\\nBrennan: You guys have your lunch, and after lunch you guys are in detention,\\nyou see the lawn outside, beautiful afternoon, filled with students all like,\\n“Oh, you\\'re my new best friend and we\\'re gonna be adventurers, yeah, let\\'s\\nmake an adventuring party.” And you see that Vice Principal Goldenhoard and a\\nsort of young gnome who is a very rosy-cheeked and has got sort of watery blue\\neyes walks in. You see they step in and Vice Principal Goldenhoard says,\\n\\nGoldenhoard: Well, well, well, troublemakers. [sees Kristen] And yeah, and\\nKristen. Troublemaking bothers me at a deep level. This school can be a\\ndangerous place. Students put a lot on the line here. And you, with your\\ntomfoolery, your jackanapery, and your shenanigans are a liability that cannot\\nbe allowed. Mr. Gibbons will handle your disciplinary action while I\\'m gone.\\n\\nBrennan: So he turns and walks out, and you see that the gnome hoists himself\\nup so he\\'s sitting on the edge of the desk and he goes,\\n\\nMr. Gibbons: [detached, calm voice] Okay, so how do we feel about what we did?\\n\\nAdaine: [raises her hand]\\n\\nMr. Gibbons: Yeah, right here.\\n\\nAdaine: I technically have diplomatic immunity and, and, ah. Do I have to be\\nhere?\\n\\nGorgug: I feel bad. I didn\\'t mean to punch you. I got so mad.\\n\\nFabian: I didn\\'t do, I did punch you, but it wasn\\'t worth it, but. I shouldn\\'t\\nbe here. My crime was being too good for the bloodrush team.\\n\\nMr. Gibbons: [nodding] Okay.\\n\\nKristen: You punched him.\\n\\nRiz: Yeah, you punched him.\\n\\nKristen: Yeah, we all watched you punch him, for no reason even.\\n\\nFabian: Okay.\\n\\nRiz: We saw that. We saw that. Your objective, yeah.\\n\\nFabian: I also admit that-- [coughs] [quietly] I also admit that I punched\\nhim. I said that.\\n\\nMr. Gibbons: [with little to no feeling] Wow, okay, so that\\'s a lot of\\nfeelings, okay? How\\'s everything at home, guys? Everything good?\\n\\nGorgug: It’s great.\\n\\nMr. Gibbons: Everything good at home?\\n\\nGorgug: Yeah.\\n\\nMr. Gibbons: Okay, now you know-\\n\\nKristen: [to Fig] Why are you crying?\\n\\nFig: Why am I crying? Because I guess you tapped into something that, [full of\\nemotion] you know, maybe home isn\\'t great.\\n\\nMr. Gibbons: Okay.\\n\\nFig: Maybe home isn\\'t great.\\n\\nMr. Gibbons: Okay, now those are strong feelings, okay, and I\\'m here to talk.\\nAbout anything, okay? If you have any problems, yes, right here?\\n\\nAdaine: Can\\'t we just do lines instead of talking?\\n\\nFabian: Yes, Jesus Christ.\\n\\nMr. Gibbons: Wow. Wow. Strong feelings all the way around, now there\\'s\\nsomething that I wanna talk to all of you about.\\n\\nBrennan: Now you guys hear a scream, a bloodcurdling scream from down the\\nhallway. Mr. Gibbons whips his head around and looks. What do you guys do?\\n\\nMurph: Riz takes off.\\n\\nLou: I follow.\\n\\nGorgug: What?\\n\\nEmily: I\\'ll go.\\n\\nAlly: Same.\\n\\nGorgug: What?\\n\\nAdaine: I mean, I guess if everybody\\'s going, we should go?\\n\\nMr. Gibbons: Now, hold on guys, don’t rush into anything!\\n\\nGorgug: I gotta go.\\n\\nEmily: I just see them running and I think we\\'re making a jailbreak.\\n\\nBrennan: You guys sprint, you run as fast as you can. The scream comes from\\nthe cafeteria.\\n\\nPlayers gasp.\\n\\nAlly: No!\\n\\nEmily: Doreen!\\n\\nSiobhan: Doreen!\\n\\nBrennan: You burst forward, the doors open, you look ahead of you and flitting\\naround the cafeteria are horrifying little shapes with long wings. You see\\ncorn gremlins, cobs of corn with malevolent eyes and wide mouths. [snarling]\\nTearing at the walls and ripping banners, and following them into the\\ncafeteria, you see Doreen, the lunch lady, with her back turned to you, slowly\\ngazing behind her shoulder, deep sunken eyes malevolent yellow as spell energy\\npulsing with arcane power wraps her ladle.\\n\\nDoreen: Hey kids, it\\'s lunch time again, because we had lunch earlier, but bad\\nlunch this time.\\n\\nKristen: If you explain the joke, it\\'s not a good joke.\\n\\nAdaine: It was bad last time.\\n\\nDoreen: It\\'s a bad lunch. It\\'s a bad lunch.\\n\\nKristen: No!\\n\\nBrennan: A monstrous pulsating mountain of creamed corn rises up, towering\\nbehind her. A colossal ooze begins to pseudopod its way forward. And I\\'m gonna\\nhave you guys roll initiative.\\n\\nPlayers roll their dice onto the board.\\n\\nZac: Ooh-kay.\\n\\nBrennan: And that\\'s where we\\'ll leave off this week on Fantasy High.
